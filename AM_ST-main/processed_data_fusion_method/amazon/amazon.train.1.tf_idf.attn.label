that it heats	3.8960949182510376
 just use the	3.8960808515548706
and has a wide	3.895825982093811
,  but reasonable	3.895803689956665
to put under	3.8956928849220276
still one of the	3.8956689834594727
if i ever lose	3.8951586484909058
will tell if it	3.895135462284088

one of my own	3.894677311182022
it s the first	3.8946024775505066

as we like	3.8940861225128174
cut into a	3.893789291381836
until i saw this	3.893113374710083
replacing all of	3.8931108713150024

and we both love	3.89302521944046
out cleanly	3.892955780029297
will do and	3.8928555250167847
for an inexpensive	3.8927335023880003
to hang it on	3.892715334892273
it is nonstick	3.892517328262329

fairly easy	3.892104768755515

alone is worth	3.8898149728775024
that they really	3.889669716358185
truly nonstick	3.8895843029022217
get excited about a	3.889477461576462
a pretty great	3.8894283771514893
can suck	3.8892946243286133
to be identical to	3.8890492916107178
they do just	3.888971269130707
is farberware	3.888811469078064

one ever breaks	3.8845120668411255
could kick myself for	3.8843915462493896
must have to	3.8843016028404236
they go from	3.884224832057953

it and it comes	3.882059097290039
has extended	3.881937563419342
well for making	3.8818273544311523
it did take a	3.8818076103925705
the more you use	3.8817737102508545
not stained	3.8817522525787354
have one ! 	3.8817191123962402
it is designed to	3.8816613256931305
dry and put	3.8815703988075256
 but easy	3.881446123123169

without great	3.8795814514160156
will be too .	3.879578709602356
double as	3.8795342445373535
to assemble and	3.8791093826306664
are nice and large	3.879091441631317
and should do	3.8790544867515564
much sturdier than	3.878897587456251
 and it holds	3.8784191012382507
to apply and last	3.878199577331543
set to be	3.877795100212097
it quite easy	3.877784013748169
fresh made	3.877627372741699
does take longer to	3.8772255182266235
to last me a	3.8764708042144775
that compares .	3.8763670921325684
be to make the	3.8761789202690125
would really recommend	3.875674605369568
anymore since	3.8756039142608643
it does the	3.8750679926471054

bought as a	3.870976993018737
if you re the	3.870931386947632
but what it	3.8709272146224976
used daily .	3.870870351791382
seems to heat	3.870796322822571
to aluminum	3.870361804962158
is easier	3.870341212855362

that will allow	3.725186347961426
without these	3.725003135204315
for just about	3.724910482764244
slightly flexible	3.724738359451294
or the smaller	3.7245715856552124

the best as	3.71317595243454
which means it will	3.7129712104797363

been used a	3.694801926612854
my much more	3.6946767568588257
that it can be	3.6942580342292786
last quite a long	3.694106936454773
tough to beat	3.693776249885559

is how quiet	3.6928334832191467
well across	3.69260036945343
this instead of a	3.6917675733566284
little longer to	3.6916122436523438
and think it is	3.691577911376953
as normal .	3.69153892993927
be easier .	3.6913649439811707
those large	3.690792888402939
could be a little	3.690792888402939

hardboiled	3.690696269273758
nicely packaged , 	3.690657615661621

it folds flat	3.688671827316284
found by	3.688327431678772
a second one .	3.688242684713017
it feels like an	3.687911868095398

much more elegant	3.5173803567886353
purchased one from	3.516925573348999
it does do a	3.51654589176178
up well over	3.5164706707000732
to experiment a	3.5162562131881714
you ll be a	3.51620614528656

heavy to lift	3.5129313468933105
safe and a	3.51289701461792
this long without	3.5124802589416504
 consider this	3.5124605894088745
you remember to	3.51226544380188
working at the	3.5121939182281494

at grinding	3.5101529955863953
far ,  and	3.509739708900452
comfortably ,  and	3.5094469785690308
 not too large	3.509373962879181
 it matches	3.5092982053756714
for myself now	3.5088608264923096
to cut myself	3.50881826877594
without one ! 	3.5085612535476685
for myself but	3.508444905281067
more can i	3.5081942876158085
and functional .	3.5079051852226257
now and used	3.507662773132324
keep it looking new	3.506876826286316
having to recharge the	3.5061800479888916

is much faster and	3.5043418407440186
very uniform	3.5041613578796387
must have for the	3.5037009716033936

use the original	3.5034602880477905
far ,  this	3.5033778101205826
to store when not	3.5032681822776794
made some of the	3.503052234649658
for that but	3.5029377937316895
to install with	3.5028727054595947
could take the	3.502853751182556
needed and wanted .	3.5022425651550293
if you like fresh	3.5021570920944214

them every single	3.4508660435676575
more consistent than	3.450630307197571
not add too	3.450413703918457
invaluable for	3.450316071510315
this to make	3.4503004367517462
with rubberized	3.450253903865814
once you use	3.45007419585966
given several	3.4497495889663696
are avid	3.4494634866714478
well i bought another	3.4492865204811096
safe as well	3.449122667312622
and since they are	3.4491002559661865
never have enough	3.448832482099533
because i keep	3.4485526084899902
am more than	3.4484052658081055
scratched over	3.4483802318573
before putting in	3.448363423347473
roll them up	3.448294699192047
have been working great	3.448258936405182
to replace all	3.4481281042099
build up on the	3.447572350502014
what counts	3.4466915130615234
of all :	3.4465620517730713
of all : 	3.4465620517730713
like that it does	3.4465494751930237
you bought it	3.446387678384781
big at	3.4457924365997314
looking for it .	3.445699453353882
num_num larger	3.4454015493392944
plus for this	3.4453686475753784
you d never know	3.445134401321411
i m more of	3.4450694918632507
around forever	3.4446276426315308
and come out looking	3.444134473800659
just follow	3.4441096952955386
already have the	3.4437026977517537
will never have to	3.4436841011047363
hardly any unpopped	3.4435003995895386
to assemble with	3.44329833984375
is very vibrant	3.443251848220825
my original .	3.4431029955566315
that s what makes	3.4430158138275146
we keep it in	3.4427273273468018
when washed in the	3.442678213119507
and dutch	3.4425480365753174
and available	3.4424638748168945
to have around	3.4422876834869385
it again with a	3.442191481590271
them yet but	3.4419367909431458
just wipe it with	3.441687226295471
at mixing	3.441533148288727
she says it is	3.441179394721985
of peeling	3.4409273862820635
or whatever else you	3.4407706260681152
when it s hot	3.440669059753418
have used it ,	3.4405317902565002
it from sliding	3.4404763281345367
that can withstand	3.440268337726593
right if	3.440260648727417
it could also	3.4399452209472656
while it was on	3.4398081600666046
if you let it	3.4397252798080444
camping this	3.439534455537796
by heating	3.4393462538719177
protecting it .	3.4393217265605927
it for so long	3.43899667263031
once ,  which	3.438957452774048
,  keep in	3.4389359951019287
nailed it	3.438691794872284
are must	3.438407778739929
did !  this	3.4382364749908447
is vastly superior to	3.4381315112113953
it to and	3.437627077102661
it from getting	3.4376073082308327
back to its original	3.4376039505004883
one for yourself and	3.4374547004699707
now for over	3.4374526739120483
now we have two	3.437061607837677
you re connected	3.4370330572128296
them daily	3.436927318572998
she loved them so	3.4367069602012634
a nifty little	3.436505764722824
that fills the	3.436228334903717
seems to last	3.4361826896667482
still using the first	3.4360374212265015
easier to attach	3.436037003993988
it so much we	3.4357762336730957
knowing you	3.4353686571121216
also good if you	3.435181677341461
much better than an	3.435014486312866
makes !	3.4348762035369873
we needed	3.4348040610551833
it helps if you	3.434663712978363
piping	3.4338708605070796
all that being	3.4338219165802
although if	3.4327808618545532
these are heavy	3.4324344992637634
would also be great	3.432028591632843
only two of us	3.4319575130939484
but much easier	3.4318718314170837
a reusable	3.431738018989563
using it to grind	3.43147873878479
you can put into	3.4312638640403748
still warm and	3.4308409690856934
frequently and it	3.430683732032776
not fall off .	3.430553376674652
but it worked out	3.4304967522621155
can spend more	3.4303605556488037
you grind your	3.4301796555519104
much be	3.4301326274871826
add a little more	3.429897725582123
plugged to	3.429744601249695
easy to carry ,	3.429725468158722
had been searching	3.429690271615982
have only made	3.429638534784317
made one for	3.429113030433655
also make a	3.4289658069610596
they have survived	3.428904712200165
that we have .	3.428395628929138
indistinguishable from the	3.4281535148620605
thinly	3.42785981297493
has lasted .	3.427797257900238
you can place	3.426727294919733
safe and it	3.426488757133484
s more convenient	3.4264737367630005
it cuts easily	3.42631459236145
well made and they	3.4261831641197205
on ,  as	3.4260460138320923
also used them for	3.4259265661239624
smaller one to	3.42558354139328
: if you	3.425431251525879
so light and easy	3.4250283241271973
s easy to apply	3.4249576926231384
driving down the	3.424440860748291
after so much	3.4242464303970337

be activated	3.4236044883728027
and find myself	3.422963261604309

longer than my original	3.422692120075226
getting scratched up	3.422175705432892

you should own	3.4167566299438477
really gets	3.416410803794861
these in various	3.416090726852417
i m comparing	3.4156676530838013
for daily	3.4156489542543413
what s nice	3.4154802560806274
before putting in the	3.4153103828430176
but it does a	3.4152138233184814
 . and ,	3.414955258369446
it does leave a	3.414566159248352
take that into	3.414028286933899
num_num more as	3.413856625556946
it for most	3.413848042488098
some rough	3.413605570793152
i keep going	3.4131574630737305
not interfere with my	3.4131112694740295
as to which	3.412713646888733

i even take this	3.4120631217956543
has a red	3.4120535850524902
it to puree	3.4118868112564087
it daily for the	3.411044180393219
had one with	3.4108328819274902
to tuck away	3.409636974334717
purchased these to replace	3.409580886363983
while to get the	3.40927255153656
or scratching	3.409095048904419
purchasing more	3.4084362387657166
you can think	3.4074892103672028
of the expensive	3.40730282664299
marked with	3.407250165939331
on snugly	3.4069912433624268
,  even ,	3.4067115783691406
what i like best	3.406393527984619
is very hot .	3.4058858156204224
a must in every	3.4057193994522095
and is of	3.404993951320648
and all is	3.4049381812433563
is much better then	3.404852271080017
when you flip	3.404768228530884
that they all	3.4047038555145264
if i need to	3.404644027352333
it was relatively easy	3.4045714139938354
from sticking and	3.404561400413513
:  from	3.4045093059539795
that finally died	3.404356598854065
right in , 	3.4039535522460938
right in ,	3.4039535522460938
it is retractable	3.4037636518478394
it down one	3.4034807682037354
 turn off the	3.403083086013794
used this to	3.402912957330259
little too large for	3.402866005897522
think it makes the	3.402833938598633
or been	3.402745842933655
while but i	3.4024518728256226
for keeping it	3.402375280857086
very fast compared	3.4021317958831787
can watch it	3.401978313922882
be hung on	3.4019662141799927
gone through quite a	3.4019311666488647
ordering some	3.401574194431305
you purchased this	3.401446044445038
it when you need	3.40129554271698
much quieter than	3.4010368982929586
as it was designed	3.400657296180725
every owned .	3.4004040956497192
by flipping	3.4000779390335083
brown evenly	3.399934470653534
sometimes make	3.399660587310791
not to bend	3.399442434310913
inexpensive and they	3.399429202079773
is thin enough to	3.3994220495224
it is still as	3.399147391319275
it s that good	3.3990520238876343
and finally decided to	3.3990068435668945
toward your	3.398696780204773
the duromatic	3.3985190391540527
do not stick .	3.3983466625213623
while traveling	3.398327330750077
never without	3.398074209690094
of her all	3.3974475860595703
is heating up .	3.3971765637397766
so you know	3.3969436436891556
how we ever	3.396582007408142
second one 	3.3965080976486206
it comes to protecting	3.3963072299957275
dry or wet	3.3962180614471436
like to bake .	3.396206498146057
it also tells	3.396165132522583
 and hold a	3.395891785621643
here than	3.395881563425064
it was all good	3.3958550691604614
or mixing	3.3956921100616455
,  they easily	3.395671248435974
able to place	3.395521342754364
as when they	3.3953787088394165
wanted ,  and	3.3952181339263916
up much	3.3951669225544627
one too !	3.395049571990967
from getting damaged	3.39492130279541
 grippy	3.394817590713501
and inexpensive , 	3.3945608139038086
and inexpensive ,	3.3945608139038086
is a lightweight	3.3942586183547974
have for	3.3941401924414483
that i broke	3.3940247297286987
cannot beat it .	3.393731117248535
been more pleased	3.393631875514984
over using the	3.3932937383651733
these are of	3.3932261765003204
am more than happy	3.3932220935821533
. it fits	3.393106162548065
they are much easier	3.3930644392967224
still have and use	3.3929505944252014
streamlined	3.3929411619901657
still one	3.3928510546684265
most often .	3.3923144936561584
it to grind my	3.392289876937866
of her all white	3.3918306827545166
because it provides	3.3916103839874268
that stays hot	3.3912602066993713
so take that into	3.3911969661712646
,  large enough	3.3909454941749573
of this one and	3.390209972858429
nice and cold	3.3899667859077454
a little small ,	3.389813005924225
is right and the	3.389497995376587
this so other	3.3888773918151855
has a cut out	3.3887815475463867
made ,  very	3.388599157333374
are heavy ,	3.3884114027023315
are heavy , 	3.3884114027023315
becoming my	3.3882322311401367
plus it has a	3.3880993723869324
grippy and	3.3877944946289062
using the first	3.38773837685585
can ever tell	3.387531042098999
it goes on the	3.3872413635253906
have two that	3.3870670199394226
 even ,	3.387001633644104
 even , 	3.387001633644104
it wraps around the	3.3869075775146484
came out very	3.3868804574012756
researched several	3.3861011266708374
inside each other .	3.3859076499938965
still look	3.3858762383461
keep it looking	3.3856094777584076
this is hands down	3.385424892105864
and pour it into	3.3845406770706177
so we could	3.3844810724258423
that it needs to	3.383878469467163
available but	3.3837562799453735
since i live alone	3.38365375995636
have been collecting	3.383394241333008
they hear me	3.383307695388794
it has belt	3.3830446004867554
and get it .	3.3828064799308777
for working out .	3.382803797721863
who wants to protect	3.382390022277832
was quick .	3.3822381496429443
are out there .	3.382218360900879
do ! 	3.382040764601554
we highly	3.3819168508052826
it s so light	3.381798505783081
but it does work	3.3817234933376312
of these if you	3.381463408470154
to put and	3.381410837173462
if needed	3.38130031964321
num_num more of	3.3811490535736084
was as easy	3.3811110258102417
little static .	3.3808159828186035
 this does a	3.3807310461997986
and have made	3.380523920059204

is gonna be	3.370110511779785
to love about this	3.3698487281799316
can be annoying .	3.3697718381881714

used it yet ,	3.3674049377420356
it to bake	3.3672968943933586
using it less	3.3670759201049805

bring one	3.3669513463974
only has this	3.366778701543808
out once a	3.3666465282440186
staying at	3.366265654563904
also looked at	3.366149514913559
stylish looking	3.366086483001709
,  for cutting	3.3656468987464905

. this little	3.364950656890869
this almost	3.364789034639949
and feel to	3.3644421100616455
to all who	3.3640143871307373
what is there to	3.363947868347168

several of these for	3.3633593022823334
who needs the	3.3628989458084106
get fast	3.3627688884735107
did without them .	3.3626235723495483
these seems	3.3625348806381226
must have ,	3.3620259761810303
must have , 	3.3620259761810303
so well that it	3.361993432044983
enough for us .	3.361983299255371
 and finally decided	3.3619236946105957
and you are all	3.3616530895233154
illustrated and	3.3612236380577087
resting on the	3.3610578775405884
keep it in .	3.3608102798461914
and substantial .	3.3607367277145386
go again .	3.360571414232254
so i can leave	3.3603546023368835

arrived early , 	3.3600643277168274
closely to	3.3600515127182007
 just hot	3.3598753809928894
but small enough to	3.3596959710121155
another one when the	3.359515368938446
packaged and in	3.3593207597732544
i find i	3.3589136600494385
just run it	3.3586159348487854
would recomend	3.358210325241089
that you can leave	3.3581963181495667
you can connect	3.357200026512146
it does much	3.3571678400039673
will be a big	3.357107937335968
now and have	3.357048511505127
skeptical about purchasing	3.356773555278778
to put in ,	3.356546401977539
do not put it	3.3562475442886353
this frequently	3.3561776876449585
her new	3.356172502040863
you should have	3.355812668800354
easier if you	3.3557626605033875
is small but	3.3557262122631073
is easy to empty	3.355446755886078
it makes this	3.3550623059272766

knock it down	3.3548290729522705
to go right out	3.354784518480301
often for	3.3543703258037567
recently ordered and	3.354004919528961
in before the	3.3539732694625854
these are made by	3.3539417386054993
as the larger	3.353877604007721

as pictured and	3.3534818291664124
it s heavy 	3.3531424403190613
them to last for	3.3531221747398376
small but does	3.353121280670166
just needs a	3.3530771732330322
s large enough for	3.3530542254447937
now and it	3.352813755765677
the higher priced	3.352694809436798

would be to make	3.35194730758667
it will out	3.3518415689468384
found these at a	3.351670801639557
exactly same	3.351292312145233
we had and	3.3512256145477295
just add a little	3.351198434829712
washed it in the	3.3509643375873566

about bluetooth	3.3494651317596436
for opening	3.3491912881553008
you can see how	3.349121729530784
it was designed .	3.3490880727767944
!  what else	3.348963499069214
preferred another	3.348960280418396
bought this primarily to	3.3476653695106506
more having to	3.347464084625244
be careful you don	3.3474013209342957

,  lightweight	3.3444800539461945
what it is intended	3.3443816900253296
it much but when	3.343569338321686
now and it s	3.3435646444559097
until you need	3.3435028791427612
and wondered if	3.342847466468811
while !	3.342584252357483
while ! 	3.342584252357483

seen a better	3.3413141667842865
been nice if the	3.3410983085632324
a collectible and sold	3.3400264978408813
the two larger	3.339888095855713

attract a	3.339756488800049
gets heavy	3.3392311334609985
you really need .	3.3389246463775635
more to replace	3.3387293815612793
to keep out	3.338497579097748
less plastic	3.3384424448013306
,  not cheap	3.3383527398109436
assemble and very	3.3382421731948853
it was first brought	3.338215470314026
they let me	3.33816397190094
 and various other	3.3380305767059326
and it was exactly	3.337910771369934
about this little	3.337593525648117
into or	3.337593197822571
then what you	3.3369548320770264
original one that	3.336936831474304
else could you ask	3.3367981910705566
the textured	3.3367502689361572
could talk	3.3366047143936157

it has a removable	3.3305376768112183
enough that they	3.3298237323760986
had to replace our	3.329782247543335
one now ! 	3.329704701900482
to determine how	3.3293750882148743
it is intended to	3.329187422990799
while maintaining	3.3291338682174683
,  toasting	3.3290162682533264
one tiny bubble	3.3287819623947144
little more expensive than	3.328741192817688
because it is easier	3.32854300737381
pretty intuitive	3.328457236289978
or flimsy	3.328354924917221

it fine , 	3.32150399684906
to stay hot	3.321222960948944

hear me loud and	3.3085713386535645
,  hold a	3.3081644773483276
removable and	3.307993769645691
more could i	3.307678699493408
to drop her	3.3076536655426025
too ,  when	3.3076003789901733
is substantial	3.3075675964334796
into tight	3.3074507415294647
drinkably hot	3.3074183464050293
less likely to	3.3072403192520143
very hefty	3.3071601390838623
on and take off	3.306759752333164
undoubtedly the best	3.306601047515869
is intended .	3.3065067529678345
is soooooo	3.306286096572876
remember that it	3.3055593967437744
it through it s	3.3055078983306885
one because we	3.305233120918274
if necessary .	3.3051889538764954
and looked so	3.304916739463806
who had one	3.3048149943351746
favorite small	3.3046199083328247
if you use cast	3.304442286491394
of mincing	3.3042047023773193
if not the best	3.3033127784729004
should last me a	3.302915096282959
them together is	3.302554190158844
!  they come	3.302498459815979
getting out the	3.3024673461914062
designed to allow	3.3023396134376526
or better than	3.302274870872498
basic , 	3.302119743824005
basic ,	3.302119743824005
making hard	3.3011050522327423
that looks great	3.3010315895080566
to use and so	3.3006852865219116
but overall it is	3.3006346225738525
haptic	3.3003348112106323
a large can of	3.300277292728424
other for	3.2991041455974797
getting one ,	3.298841416835785
to protect it from	3.2983317971229553
to store it	3.298257738351822
you can drain	3.2980284094810486
once you get use	3.29787015914917
very little static	3.2976815700531006
this for at	3.2975040674209595
just toss it in	3.2973549365997314
what are you waiting	3.297236680984497
so pretty on	3.2967570424079895
it safe	3.2966747879981995
s a little large	3.2962867617607117
has been looking	3.296232223510742
substantial ,  and	3.296231746673584
take so long	3.29617440700531
it and keep	3.2956023514270782
take up too	3.2950804914755416
me from having	3.2942595779895782
 arrived	3.294103056192398
else you can	3.2939382791519165
also bring	3.2939186692237854
it works seamlessly	3.2938459515571594
philly	3.2938278913497925
when laying	3.2934433221817017
it and using it	3.292537033557892
is how long	3.2925108075141907
sticking it	3.2923693656921387
up on finding	3.2922180891036987
for everyday	3.291792869569995
it looking like new	3.2917821407318115
that would make me	3.2916903495788574
more for our	3.2910534739494324
used them i	3.2908815145492554
who sees it	3.2905880212783813
used it once so	3.2901053726673126
for so long ,	3.290092349052429
have chosen this	3.2899966835975647
looking for this	3.2899522980073574
cared for .	3.2898977994918823
if is	3.28952157497406
so effortless	3.289510488510132
hot for about	3.289491683244705
even dropped it	3.289102077484131
!  much	3.288812637327046
without it .	3.2887445188363054
particular about my	3.288339376449585
delightfully surprised	3.2882535457611084
you throw at it	3.287539005279541
to move it around	3.2873403429985046
without them .	3.2872537076473236
it weekly	3.287231981754303
you desire	3.287116974592209
very even .	3.286934494972229
and i think you	3.286885142326355
but small enough	3.2868361473083496
it when i don	3.28669810295105
cannot wait to	3.286095142364502

we ve purchased .	3.2854387164115906
is safe in	3.2853659987449646

to arrive but	3.28517746925354
and put away	3.2844409942626953
lipped	3.2843650579452515
it sideways	3.283861458301544
me and one	3.2837987899780274
little small ,	3.283795416355133
little small , 	3.283795416355133
shipped me out	3.2837626338005066
this on a daily	3.2835590839385986
and built .	3.28314870595932
it releases	3.2827893793582916
expensive than they are	3.282637596130371
it came with some	3.2826057076454163
easily removed from the	3.2822489738464355
so much healthier .	3.2822399139404297
it can be plugged	3.2818853855133057
 good looking ,	3.2815436124801636
major plus	3.281355857849121
at least once every	3.281279683113098
driving down	3.2810132205486298
red one .	3.280533254146576
on my old one	3.2802761793136597
more soon	3.279889941215515
with keeping the	3.279760479927063
to use out	3.2794772386550903
were looking for an	3.2793631553649902
out there but they	3.27915358543396
it streams	3.278697431087494
you could want .	3.2786446809768677
easily ,  as	3.278614580631256
inherited	3.2784218788146973
why you need	3.277946710586548
have a few extra	3.2779115438461304
to make french	3.2774405479431152
and seems very	3.277349154152411
well with both .	3.2770249247550964
them locally .	3.276548683643341
most do	3.2764101326465607
or dried	3.2760350108146667
else could you	3.2759589850902557
moved into	3.2755340456962583
off but that	3.2753069400787354
 created	3.274808406829834
do such	3.2731980085372925
finally purchased this	3.2731470465660095
you re waiting for	3.2728245854377747
its there	3.271814942361849
out and about	3.2716580629348755
probably not for	3.271380990743637
this one and decided	3.2712945342063904
each of our	3.2709062099456787
owned one before	3.2701367139816284
s very high	3.2700559496879578
these again if	3.2688978910446167
built with a	3.268744647502899
as a small	3.267952660721476
for traveling and	3.2679362297058105
and up to	3.2676515579223633
 this is as	3.2674410939216614
open or closed .	3.2662013173103333
believe how fast	3.2652971148490906
perform very	3.2641422748565674
add much	3.2634612056930217
have already dropped	3.2633153200149536
when they see it	3.263144373893738
you keep the	3.2630790074645946
the even	3.2630119125067516
intended to do	3.2628730684518814
these are by far	3.2628288865089417
made so many	3.262823522090912
ever go	3.2628034055233
finnish	3.2627052068710327
have when	3.262700951099396
and it did a	3.2625294029712677
and paring	3.261750340461731
possibly need	3.260955333709717
it should be 	3.2608931064605713
and i do use	3.2606148719787598
mainly when	3.2600587606430054
could want in	3.2597129344940186
is used at least	3.2592819929122925
much to review	3.258872866630554
it has turned	3.2586269080638885
into which	3.2585946321487427
without being too	3.2580533623695374
outlive me .	3.257960557937622
with bluetooth ,	3.257746398448944
with bluetooth , 	3.257746398448944
is endless .	3.2576945424079895
like my first	3.257075250148773
together and comes	3.256845772266388
after emptying the	3.256649136543274
gave this as	3.256387859582901
duromatic	3.256346583366394
and barely noticeable	3.2552404403686523
up nicely so	3.2551148533821106
thin enough to slide	3.2544445991516113
than make up for	3.254372775554657
,  empty and	3.254276990890503
want it to do	3.2537763595581057
which finally	3.2536026537418365
. using the	3.2535988092422485
so it remains	3.2533347606658936
clear ,  no	3.2532105445861816
just can t say	3.253044366836548
not too long .	3.253023147583008
pretty quickly as	3.2528653740882874
across this and	3.2517993450164795
and take off	3.2517466280201583
them to store	3.2513797283172607
done properly	3.251347541809082
in and go .	3.251149892807007
they get used	3.2510563731193542
pretty basic ,	3.2509079575538635
only me	3.2506656646728516
almost forget	3.2503867149353027
good for turning	3.250357210636139
should be around	3.2498202323913574
had it long	3.249714732170105
you cannot beat this	3.249199092388153
and rinse out	3.2490384578704834
had just the	3.2487323880195618
sliding around .	3.2486051321029663
probably one of my	3.2482555508613586
they have held	3.2481034845113754
one in another	3.2480674982070923
it s larger than	3.2476168870925903
looking forward to making	3.2473949193973572
daily and it	3.2469809850036673
you waiting	3.246601939201355
illustrated gave	3.2460957765579224
one of these over	3.2460265159606934
have had it at	3.245609402656555
there to say ,	3.245549440383911
suggested getting	3.245183229446411
have only used the	3.245008707046509
traditional 	3.244277238845825
to last just as	3.2441848516464233
and it always works	3.244101107120514
to juicing	3.244058132171631
you want the best	3.244037926197052
really did a	3.2438024282455444
little uncomfortable	3.243786484003067
keep asking	3.243762731552124
be peeled	3.2432299852371216
it includes a	3.243115544319153
do keep it	3.2429897785186768
to remove for	3.242602229118347
and they replaced it	3.242003917694092
unlike our	3.2416117191314697
than microwaving	3.241504430770874
 is far	3.24067622423172
to five .	3.2405853271484375
and intact .	3.2405665516853333
and looking like	3.240217924118042
and is fairly	3.239739735919199
this to store my	3.2396355271339417
to work out with	3.2389737367630005
and comes apart easily	3.2384872436523438
it once so	3.2383587658405304
to see when it	3.2381458282470703
more uniformly	3.237703800201416
and is very light	3.2375389337539673
 well designed ,	3.237532079219818
we eat	3.2371766567230225
enough about	3.2369517162442207
the one and two	3.236832320690155
keep it warm .	3.2365742325782776
so you must be	3.2365435361862183
takes a few	3.235908143222332
seasoning	3.235858475167875
i wish this were	3.2357630133628845
you ask of a	3.2356173992156982
looked long and	3.2354752123355865
they feel good in	3.2351291179656982
they flex	3.2348291873931885
making new	3.234427273273468
off any excess	3.2342693209648132
it from moving	3.2341647148132324
 and very quickly	3.23403537273407
them to dry	3.2337934970855713
and this one did	3.233783483505249
used regularly	3.2337344586849213
keep up the good	3.232581913471222
enough for me for	3.232102692127228

why you d	3.230069160461426
up rapidly	3.2296178340911865
protecting your	3.229400932788849
only had these for	3.229042410850525
another without	3.229040801525116
them also .	3.2285773754119873
is really hot	3.2282239198684692
negative is the	3.228120654821396

removes a	3.2271931171417236
to make scrambled	3.227178454399109
and these have been	3.2270655035972595
than one or	3.224884867668152
counting up	3.2247930765151978
often and i	3.2246179580688477
that out it	3.2242891788482666
an unbeatable	3.2242581844329834
is porous	3.223068594932556
and this did the	3.2226157188415527

make sure you buy	3.220050036907196
and makes for a	3.2194218039512634
pouch to keep it	3.219371795654297
much as any	3.219003677368164
made was the	3.218886137008667
rubberized hard	3.21848201751709
it to reheat	3.2178250551223755

and i m thinking	3.2158602476119995
owned over the	3.215523362159729
well  :	3.2155057787895203
than expected and	3.214386522769928
never go back to	3.213315137796534
it to do ,	3.212748169898987
,  listening	3.2125690579414368

to fit tightly	3.2117700576782227
the can is open	3.2116875052452087

and got tired of	3.1988601684570312
well both	3.198842704296112
wanted to wait	3.1987305879592896

just for that .	3.198152780532837
leave one in	3.198012411594391

as additional	3.195420503616333
 and nice looking	3.1953996419906616
fast enough for	3.1953266263008118
a little uncomfortable	3.1951215267181396
then into the	3.195114254951477
it through it	3.1950842142105103
more solidly	3.194565773010254
it more comfortable	3.194453716278076
i coated it	3.194409728050232
easy and look	3.1942778825759888
for the serious	3.193689465522766
talking to me	3.1933990716934204
be careful you	3.192901611328125
this inexpensive	3.1920576691627502
to grab and go	3.1918795108795166
still hear it	3.191770613193512
will show the	3.1917640566825867
hot during the	3.191700279712677
,  fill it	3.1914128065109253

 smoked	3.191158890724182
while working .	3.190991163253784
most often for	3.190736472606659
but might be	3.1903849840164185
with us when we	3.190365433692932
putting hot	3.190111219882965
to be properly	3.1896557807922363
talking on this	3.1894229650497437
is that they come	3.1887736916542053
well and wash	3.1884756684303284
to wash one	3.18847119808197
when you want them	3.1880158185958862
deducted a	3.1877743005752563
used it over	3.1876301765441895
faster than my old	3.1869226694107056
to keep it hot	3.1869006156921387
have had several different	3.186510443687439
under $ this is	3.186469316482544
these for over a	3.1864393949508667
invented this	3.186020851135254
some have commented	3.185843527317047
needed and	3.1856686770915985
is small so it	3.1851816177368164
from having to buy	3.1851759552955627
expected which was	3.184778332710266
bought this little	3.1846055388450623
not like some	3.184541702270508
has changed my	3.184229850769043
girly .	3.1831319332122803
it to all my	3.1826230883598328
,  seems to	3.18240769703984
going out to	3.1823771595954895
we leave the	3.1817182898521423
more you can ask	3.1816741824150085
it for both my	3.1816011667251587
and they take up	3.1814600229263306
it s not num_extend	3.181378483772278
be sure to use	3.181035816669464
firmly on the	3.181011378765106
knew that going in	3.180497646331787
with the timely	3.180406391620636
gladly paid	3.1801101565361023
heavy enough to not	3.180000901222229
am planning on buying	3.179918646812439
tamping	3.179903209209442
primarily for the	3.1795789003372192
because we use	3.179566264152527
store them in the	3.179440200328827
went on easily and	3.179217576980591
once you learn	3.1790860493957993
is done in	3.178631067276001
be well constructed and	3.1785717606544495
like a larger	3.1785261631011963
a second as	3.1781139969825745
important when	3.1779772341251373
be careful not to	3.177693843838976
just stick it	3.1775776147842407
they answered	3.177575170993805
really worry	3.1773507595062256
this almost daily and	3.1770193576812744
 and walk away	3.1769412457942963
what comes with	3.176862895488739
become our	3.1763839721679688
have found that using	3.1760773062705994
set to add	3.175753951072693
its there .	3.175585091114044
used almost daily .	3.1754153966903687
to come with the	3.175387382507324
done yet .	3.1751811504364014
so i needed	3.174773144721985
little short for	3.1745746731758118
it feels in my	3.1744545698165894
gave this as a	3.174437329173088
put on and off	3.1737849712371826
are still being	3.1734079122543335
of the can ,	3.173038065433502
with us when	3.1726911664009094
used yet ,	3.1718966364860535
used yet , 	3.1718966364860535
least once every	3.1718305349349976
be back for more	3.171617031097412
needed my	3.171529173851013
down really well	3.171502649784088
?  no more	3.171321749687195
two over	3.170655369758606
be used very	3.1704968214035034
think it is very	3.1703782081604004
preseasoned ,	3.170014351606369
preseasoned , 	3.170014351606369
used my old one	3.169865608215332
it because it makes	3.169500946998596
these can t	3.16945743560791
as back ups	3.1687663793563843
they worked like	3.168669641017914
in without	3.1682736575603485
needed a basic	3.168123960494995
thrown at it .	3.168105185031891
to use and maintain	3.1677392721176147
forever with	3.16768079996109
and very heavy	3.1675287783145905
has been good for	3.166632354259491
we fill	3.165525496006012
fairly small and	3.1649497747421265
visited and	3.164766311645508
 it turns on	3.164738714694977
it turns on .	3.164738714694977
it s the real	3.1644338369369507
for making large	3.1641334295272827
.  . otherwise	3.1641104221343994
 . otherwise	3.1641104221343994
down with your	3.163874387741089
to use and are	3.1633204221725464
seems to be very	3.1632270514965057
because it has more	3.1625741720199585
essential and	3.162558376789093
that it fits into	3.162318468093872
making for	3.161851565041155
up as they	3.161786198616028
in about two	3.1613748371601105
up well in	3.1613442103048275
on easily with	3.161216676235199
dropped it yet	3.1609615087509155
just plugged	3.1609150767326355
must in	3.1609024405498025
it is light enough	3.1596729159355164
scary sharp	3.159201979637146
,  remove	3.15874707698822
but once you have	3.157941997051239
low priced	3.1579211354255676
on working	3.15760338306427
and with proper	3.157322108745575
more uniform	3.157174587249756
wanted to add to	3.1570504903793335
having used both	3.156261444091797
looked everywhere for	3.156218647956848
!  they fit	3.1560513377189636
 as with any	3.1553491950035095
it to sit	3.154812276363373
one and am very	3.1546062231063843
well and gives	3.1545409560203552
 also a	3.1538566946983337
even browning	3.153698146343231
to get many	3.153665065765381
hardly know it	3.153638005256653
you can spend more	3.153493106365204
that i wish the	3.1532347202301025
to empty ,	3.1531909704208374

to go !	3.1525611281413504
to go ! 	3.1525611281413504
at least num_num more	3.1524957418441772
used for all	3.151259124279022
with a french	3.1512027382850647
only wish it were	3.1509175896644592

very intuitive ,	3.150734782218933
very intuitive , 	3.150734782218933
 still looks	3.150404989719391
they would be ,	3.1503453254699707
had been wanting	3.150022029876709
not add much	3.1499776542186737
it has a flat	3.149401903152466
when we need to	3.149113357067108
the better and	3.1487396359443665
was always afraid	3.1485053300857544
the fondue	3.147842288017273
for me and one	3.1476113200187683
to have a long	3.147604763507843
using the flat	3.1473469734191895
at and use	3.1473308801651
it fits under	3.1472167372703552
bought these over	3.1470454931259155
for at least three	3.146880269050598
that good ! 	3.1467577815055847
now and still	3.1467033326625824
it too !	3.1464630365371704
it gives me more	3.1460025906562805
icing	3.1458534030699004
you how to do	3.145846724510193
be heavy .	3.1452664732933044
from sticking to the	3.1446219980716705
and recieved it	3.1444960832595825
t even tell that	3.144038200378418
very deep , 	3.1437885761260986
forever so	3.1430447101593018
bought at the same	3.14296817779541
to be extra careful	3.1428131461143494
zwilling	3.1425796449184418
down so far .	3.1425169110298157
,  i highly	3.141824552644684
to dump .	3.141653895378113
was much cheaper than	3.1416449546813965
about everyday	3.1396690011024475
have not actually	3.139630079269409
setting that	3.1392621994018555
my rooted	3.139009177684784
in such a small	3.138951301574707
sure to pick	3.1387916207313538
should be good .	3.1385239362716675
 had it for	3.1384626030921936
to be without them	3.138357698917389
elderly and	3.138269305229187
buy this same	3.137783110141754
very basic ,	3.1371206045150757
like that there s	3.1368380784988403
slightly smaller and	3.1366780400276184
it and really	3.136536180973053
also ,  do	3.136008381843567
its got	3.1356462836265564
to use and requires	3.1356456875801086
to heat a	3.135404884815216
replace our old	3.135373890399933
,  filtered	3.1350159645080566
finally decided on	3.1349638998508453
indestructible ,	3.1346826255321503
indestructible , 	3.1346826255321503
it s small ,	3.1343547999858856
can not go	3.134001910686493
what more do	3.1339829762757105
it s hefty	3.1334394216537476
the third one of	3.133329749107361
it s bpa free	3.1328660249710083
not had to change	3.1317052245140076
slowly and carefully	3.131389319896698
so far have not	3.1313703060150146
it s still hot	3.1309300661087036
who does a	3.1304547786712646
looked and looked for	3.130066394805908
one that broke	3.129943370819092
s attractive , 	3.129597008228302
to have for	3.129473703245623
to love ?	3.1294301748275757
to love ? 	3.1294301748275757
like a smaller	3.1292706727981567
chill the	3.12913316488266
but took a	3.1290918588638306
about a can	3.1289267539978027
and still looks and	3.1288525462150574
is always dropping	3.128490149974823
able to locate	3.128482699394226
installed this in	3.1272882223129272
 and much much	3.127050995826721
by how large	3.12701553106308
that you can adjust	3.126688301563263
these for many	3.1265875697135925
better with it	3.1265580654144287
are coming with	3.1262370944023132
it !  very	3.12574565410614
and it matches my	3.1257203221321106
see how it stands	3.1256097555160522
did its	3.1255043506622315
from cutting	3.1253230571746826
already came	3.124994933605194

french rolling	3.123758554458618
ago and have already	3.1234723329544067
is very large but	3.1231841444969177
 so these	3.122936487197876
also important to	3.1228211522102356
how you like	3.1226754188537598
an almost daily	3.122188150882721

for me to carry	3.10306978225708
over ,  they	3.102973222732544
much better it	3.1027498841285706
it cuts like	3.102504014968872
most functional	3.1018584966659546
they still look like	3.1018394231796265
is easy to maneuver	3.101707696914673
longer in the	3.1015506088733673

 takes up less	3.1006649136543274
an awesome little	3.100503981113434
once i figured that	3.1003957986831665
snugly in the	3.100214719772339
just had to have	3.1001957058906555

needed a big	3.096749186515808
very snugly .	3.0966880917549133
smallest one is	3.096471130847931
it feels a little	3.0963170528411865
is substantial ,	3.0960923433303833
to find it on	3.0958542227745056

at least once a	3.0954357584299044

took a little longer	3.063993752002716
and she like	3.0632779002189636
broke down and purchased	3.0631566047668457
go wrong here	3.0626206398010254

for that yet	3.058640956878662
so easy to maneuver	3.0576205253601074
already dropped the	3.0570788979530334
to try some of	3.0569214820861816
and also looks	3.0569085478782654
up quickly and is	3.0568915605545044
if you wash it	3.056538701057434
this is of	3.0559521913528442
first deep	3.0558043718338013
now make	3.0553792317689235
we replaced it	3.0553670724250965
well for me so	3.0553555488586426
some left over .	3.054892122745514
again if	3.0547894672894276
though i m not	3.0546895265579224
which hold	3.054601550102234
likely to use	3.0541906356811523
becoming my favorite	3.054051399230957
mostly to	3.0533702015876774
,  very slim	3.0525963604450226
these for at least	3.052365303039551
makes only	3.0521503686904907
wanted one that was	3.052099347114563

have gone from	3.0502610206604004
well at a	3.050134778022766
so i went looking	3.049895167350769
as are all	3.0496948957443237
the led on the	3.0496811866760254
once you adjust	3.0492687225341797
more without	3.0483797192573547
blown away at the	3.0479021072387695

touch sensitive	3.0457019805908203
on without a	3.0453500151634216
even with very	3.045136332511902
to preheat .	3.0450093746185303
dropped it several	3.044861853122711
which was a nice	3.044706881046295
came out looking	3.043583393096924
it continues to perform	3.0432093143463135
it perk	3.0429157614707947
that would match	3.0428698658943176
and listening	3.0417593717575073
was a second	3.041560649871826
she absolutely	3.0414835611960154

up on how to	3.0412515997886658
you prefer .	3.040951728820801
to use and super	3.0408337712287903
 you do have	3.039539158344269
was considering .	3.039378523826599
big and not too	3.0389596223831177
 and fill	3.038632035255432

through tough	3.0368428230285645
it accordingly	3.0367377400398254
to fine .	3.036583364009857
to make large	3.0358976423740387

have not cooked	3.0347328186035156

typically take	3.032626509666443
grizzled	3.0326130986213684

running out .	3.03069269657135
it does not take	3.03053700924098
it replaced the	3.030451536178589
dropped a few	3.02999347448349
did not need it	3.029407024383545
expensive than some of	3.028494119644165
they were just a	3.028298020362854
because i tend	3.0281054973602295
that last a	3.0277082324028015
be careful the	3.0275991559028625
concerned that this	3.0267342627048492

do feel a	3.0256441235542297
than plugging	3.0256155133247375
and she s very	3.0254188179969788

 then add	3.0252575874328613
when working out	3.0248259902000427
we replaced it with	3.0247942606589167
it light	3.024153470993042
does stain	3.023757576942444
and heavy and the	3.0234941840171814

done for you .	3.0035075545310974
for any and	3.0032414197921753
and added it	3.0026182532310486
what you expect it	3.0024752020835876
just remember not	3.0024454593658447
a little funny	3.0024370551109314
,  white and	3.0020105838775635
to use in her	3.000805377960205
you carry your	3.00067275762558

longer and wider than	2.9999488592147827
swiping	2.999846776324622
this worked really	2.9996895790100098
 preventing	2.9996659755706787
and take it with	2.9991069436073303
even included a	2.9988324642181396
while hot	2.9982388019561768
does not stick ,	2.99733430147171
one which lasted	2.9968464374542236

 very slim	2.995431125164032
 and so the	2.995263636112213
seems to keep	2.9951059818267822

minced	2.9942570328712463
it to steam	2.993749976158142

made the big	2.9928821325302124
out soft	2.992797553539276
wanted new	2.992621898651123
bit smaller and	2.992575764656067
does not add much	2.9925754964351654

never once had a	2.9866409301757812

constantly ,  but	2.8556331992149353
is ,  after	2.8553801774978638
advertised ,  it	2.8550360798835754
that is done	2.8550350666046143
,  comparing	2.853277623653412
with deeper	2.8529998660087585
you could bake	2.8529152274131775
most expensive but	2.852870225906372
in white or	2.852689027786255
would but it again	2.852497398853302

apart from that	2.8451616168022156
is it could	2.845069468021393

still cheaper	2.807620584964752
looking with	2.8075870871543884

kick myself for not	2.79826283454895
though and they	2.7976182103157043
that you push	2.7966895699501038

t even notice it	2.7901400327682495
was really nice .	2.7892768383026123
that you shouldn	2.788894772529602
you should have no	2.7888351380825043

this was cheaper than	2.7842745184898376

indeed make	2.783137261867523

how it works but	2.782333493232727

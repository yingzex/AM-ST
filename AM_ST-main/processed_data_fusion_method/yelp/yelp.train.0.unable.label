i was sadly mistaken .
so on to the hoagies , the italian is general run of the mill .
minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce .
nothing really special & not worthy of the $ _num_ price tag .
are you kidding me ?
i ordered it without lettuce , tomato , onions , or dressing .
are you kidding me ?
in this case , never .
( the hoagie bun was better than average . )
someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be .
we will not be back .
used to go there for tires , brakes , etc .
terrible .
so frustrated .
never going back .
they seem overpriced , too .
shortly after returning home she started to cough and gag like .
she was very uncomfortable .
wait _num_ hrs .
absolutely no problems .
noisy snow tires in the summer !
i told him they are too noisy .
i dropped off _num_ shirts at this establishment just before thanksgiving .
sign is blank and all fixtures from the store have been removed .
i never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be .
two scrambled whole eggs , italian toast , and home fries .
trash .
nothing special .
it does n't say cash only anywhere inside or on the menu either .
the coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate .
i fed my whole family breakfast ( _num_ of us ) for $ _num_ .
not to mention my allergies were in full effect .
the bathroom was so inconvenient to get in and out of .
breakfast was pathetic .
apparently , we were out of luck .
it 's a tiny long bar just like the old irish pubs .
no more smoking allowed .
same lousy service .
i really really want this place to do better .
we need more irish pubs and local old time watering holes .
whatever the case , they have cold guinness .
we used a coupon from the paper for a _num_ topping _num_ cut sicilian .
the onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can .
it was gross .
what a mistake .
the business is not run the way it has been in the past .
the corn lacked butter .
the door i was at had signage ( open hours ) .
i used to order takeout here once every month or so .
otherwise i 'll have to have him put to sleep .
i did n't feel welcome here .
terrible service .
but my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit .
so , he took the meals back to the kitchen .
they did n't remake anything .
does that make you a little worried ?
consider where this place is , the prices are really really high .
nothing is served on the side with main dishes ... .
there are better restaurants in carnegie .
ugh .
not a ton of flavor there either .
his broccoli was rock hard - like wood !
and the chicken was very dry .
ridiculous .
obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management .
appalling !
my husband & i ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time .
my lettuce was drowning in the vinegar .
my husband 's pasta had even less flavor than mine .
well , papa j 's has officially priced itself out of our budget .
$ _num_ per salad ?
it 's lettuce , cheese , and pine nuts !
$ _num_ / salad ?
we are not going back .
it rather looks like a deli counter .
a bit confusing layout , but tastefully done .
the dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant .
annoying ?
confused ?
the older man that took us to the table could have done nicer .
the chicken piccata was flavorful , but not as expected .
my friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage .
i ordered a drink _num_ times and never got it .
place is a total joke .
the last visit i overlooked the $ _num_ gnocchi special .
potatoes or pasta are always included with marsala .
never ever again will we return here .
not us .
just so rude .
i 've never posted a yelp review before .
no marinara sauce .
you may want to consider having the pizza delivered .
my expectations for mcdonalds are t rarely high .
i 've eaten at various mcdonalds restaurants for over _num_ years .
order : big mac , large fries , diet coke .
no sodas .
poor customer service .
people were getting refunds wait time was so long .
_num_ .
_num_ .
seating inside is very limited .
i 'm not a huge fan of this location .
the store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere .
however , if you 're looking for something specific , good luck .
i usually only stop there if i 'm already at tend waterfront .
not at this location .
wish i had looked it up earlier .
but the food came cold .
might have been a stomach bug but it is kind of strange .
def not worth the wait .
i really like the chili .
store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair .
cheap and crap service .
the service is awful .
it was all i could taste .
dirty and slow .
this location is terrible .
so i then went on to tell her what i wanted on my burger .
food is cheap but portions are small .
also the restaurant is not really clean either .
this restaurant is not my number _num_ choice .
just bad service .
our waitress was very polite , though .
i have eaten here before and never had any problems .
slow service .
food is very cheap though .
i would go here if the service was faster and better .
slow .
still no food .
we were a party of _num_ adults and _num_ kid .
i 've worked at steak n shake before .
the manager here needs better training .
however they ( waitresses ) were nice and apologetic .
terrible customer service .
five guy burgers much better .
disgusting .
i only returned because i was getting my dog groomed at the nearby petco .
lame .
lame as heck .
the music the guys played was all stuff from like _num_ .
i would not recommend anybody go .
this place has gone significantly down hill .
however , each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller .
very slow and boring .
we had reservations , which was good because it was packed that saturday night .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
why should it , those computers are always making mistakes .
we would be paying several hundred dollars to get the doors installed .
goodbye lowes ... hello home depot !
what a shame !
if you are going to order something , i would go with the pizza .
we also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good , also .
she sent it back .
to boot , the beer was pretty expensive .
the biggest downfall of duke 's , though , is the food .
i ate two of the _num_ tenders ( seven ! )
_num_ strikes .
bar staff not so much this visit .
waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts .
trying to get something healthy , i ordered the apple pecan salad .
gross !
the food is crap .
mediocre service .
cold food !
our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted .
bland food .
_num_ beer per hour maximum .
avoid at all costs .
mind you , our food still has n't came yet .
i was frustrated .
yep , the food was cold .
waitress never apologized .
it was a saturday !
_num_ bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full .
for how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends .
wo n't be back .
what the hell !
lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people !
this place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms .
i will never spend money here again !
awful awful .
wrong !
was so salty and just not good .
so we again go off in search of someone to help .
i ate here for lunch today with my wife and _num_ kids .
to me , thats a big factor in rating restaurants .
this was n't the cleanest place .
also they are n't following corporate policy .
i 'd hate to be there when they are `` busy '' .
no apologies nothing .
i would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat .
the food was bad .
if you are under _num_ you must be accompanied by a _num_ year old .
awful place with rude people .
we will not be going back !
the service was terrible .
especially multiple employees , hostesses , waitresses , and bus boys .
she brought a pile of beverage napkins .
anyway , do n't try to eat here .
Neutral
ghetto , the server kept calling me baby all night .
staff is rude .
the server takes my plate , and says they would make it right .
ca n't say much for an office that is managed this way .
guess not .
cant rate the food cause i have n't received any .
but since its _num_ guess they are closed .
horrible service .
not worth one star !
- original pretzel appetizer .
- lots of food choices ... burgers ... steak ... chicken ... salads .
lots of drink choices ... beers ... wines ... mixed drinks .
head next door to sing sing for drinks , though .
the low point lately has been the food .
till then , it 's hit or miss !
i must admit , i do like the brews .
i also like the white cheddar mash potatoes .
other than that , meh .
the restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table .
here 's where i ran into problems .
the husband had the bbq chicken pizza .
poor service and food .
i was very disappointed .
but yes , you guessed it , that 's overpriced too .
the steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of ... .
not the best dinner they have eaten .
it was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon .
over all this meal was a wash .
corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck .
the service has also suffered tremendously .
i do n't expect this rock bottom to be around too much longer .
i ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me .
very disappointing menu .
on my own dish i had the classic mac n ' chicken .
everything else , avoid .
instead of caramelized onions , they added raw onions .
wo n't visit again .
do not come here to eat .
_num_ stars because the beer was good .
it was so underwhelming .
i wish the food could match the quality of their beer .
if you want rock bottom food , head to rock bottom .
was served freezing cold enchiladas and pizza .
second , the sodas are not free refills !
it 's not that hard .
_num_ - put the drink prices on the website too .
not all the prices are on the website , which makes for difficult planning .
it was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl .
it was n't edible .
but damn , i was hungry !
is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on ?
sadly , no .
the food was lousy .
we also sent an order of chicken fingers back ... dryer than sand .
overpriced , shitty food and drinks .
seating is first come , first served .
whoever designed this place should be shot .
that 's where the praise ends .
_num_ .
and it 's not just coffee , and not just target .
_num_ .
_num_ .
very disappointed .
costco was closed so i went to giant eagle .
went to barnes and noble waterfront with _num_ books on my list .
it 's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows .
rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders .
so , i settled on the hummus appetizer .
thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back .
worst part ?
_num_ .
there were fruit flies everywhere .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the _num_ of us got to bar louie at 8:30 .
i very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first .
worst serves ever .
it 's expensive , the food is so so .
skip it .
our server , was friendly .
my husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me .
awful acoustics !
bobby and i came here after dinner and sat up at the bar .
not cool , bar louie .
not cool .
_num_ mins .
i wan na love bar louie , i do .
he immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks .
we originally sat upstairs , which was open per the sign .
the one other time that i had been there the service was so-so .
awkward .
the only other bartender was slowly walking around the other end of the bar .
sat at the bar at about _num_ saturday for appetizers and drinks .
the manager was rude .
nothing to rave about .
it was just ordinary .
all in all , this place just needs a bit of organization .
terrible service .
small flies flying around restaurant .
the drinks are very expensive but that 's every bar louie .
an adult area would change all this .
i 'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer .
disgusted .
my sister for a deal for _num_ and day in the _num_ season .
thats not really a big deal .
that is a downfall .
some horse play and such .
$ _num_ locker .
i really hate this place .
all of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go .
absolutely terrible night .
otherwise , i would suggest staying far , far away !
fried rice super bland .
chicken was slimy .
service was indifferent .
rice is a little plain but i just add some soy sauce .
meh , i 've experienced better is an understatement .
_num_ .
somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard .
_num_ .
_num_ .
disappointment .
_num_ .
so sad .
i order the jack daniel 's chicken and shrimp with just fries .
even the water tasted weird .
nothing special just around average !
went with _num_ others for a weeknight dinner .
why was my beer warm ?
it was disgusting .
i 'm sure there 's still a lot of room for improvement , however .
avoid this place !
i really never want to return .
the menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive .
bad bad service .
only in a pinch .
my husband 's salad , italian chopped , was better .
it had huge chunks of tomatoes , sausage , and cheese .
i understand , you ca n't try them all .
no one .
i 'm not holding up a line .
i hate this place .
our drinks and my soup came out immediately .
the skins were a bit thick and doughy .
we finished our dumplings .
we tried going early , late -- it never made any difference .
i had the singapore rice noodles .
sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick .
the service was annoying .
it was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died .
they were also playing _num_ year old pop music really loud .
come on -- this is an `` asian bistro . ''
i get there , look at their giant selection and get excited .
this pf changs needs new management !
drinks were not good .
the phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door .
terrible experience !
very bad experience .
i started with a cup of their wonton soup .
none at all .
the service was not that professional !
the service was terrible .
not going back .
would n't go back .
i you want chinese go to how lee , or china palace .
when we got to the table , we were hoping for a better experience .
my only regret is i can not leave a 1/2 star rating .
it was bitter cold outside .
chicken was very tough .
bottom line , enterprise ca n't be trusted .
bad service all around !
i ordered chicken tortellini pasta and chicken noodle soup .
it did not even look appetizing .
stopped by sunday morning .
the light roast coffee was cold .
the steak was ice cold .
do not eat the pastries !
needless to say , will be my last time going there .
am i the only one ?
target reminds me of hills when i was a kid .
watch out when it looks like something is on sale .
i 'm shocked , never thought men 's dress clothes were so pricey .
first of all , the store was messy .
okay , i get it , they work on commission , but seriously .
my husband said , i 'm looking for some dress shirts and pants .
however , i knew my husband wanted to use the gift card .
i did n't get it .
worst customer service .
it 's not that delish .
so i wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff .
strawberry pies being the exception to the rule .
ugh .
my drink was never refilled .
if i remembered her name , i would definitely mention it in this review .
it 's a hit and miss .
it 's not .
does n't matter what time we go .
get your hosts and servers on the same page !
no apology .
she simply said that sometimes they are n't told when someone is seated outside .
good cheap food .
horrible service .
did n't get any refills .
the coffee was stale .
i talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side .
_num_ staff members yelled .
she then rings me up .
very disappointing experience .
will not be returning .
not good .
not good .
why _num_ star ?
my meal was way over cooked .
had lobster bisque soup not to good .
the scallops were hard , over cooked .
shrimp had no flavor .
whoever gave this place _num_ or five stars must be out of their minds .
bad decision .
the chowder was basically flour stew with potatoes .
stringy , asian crab that was definitely pre-made .
terrible .
very disappointing easter dinner .
first time in pittsburgh on biz and staying in the waterfront district .
disappointed .
very disappointing .
chef 's special was penne in a light alfredo sauce with crab and shrimp .
i had the scallops with stir fried vegetables .
the garnish had cheese on it the first time , not the 2nd .
may not ever go back .
will not eat here again .
the quality is completely gone , portions are smaller , prices higher .
the server even tried pushing a diners club program on us !
there were five very small shrimp on the plate .
the crab stuffing was mostly stuffing .
for the prices at this place , i had hoped for so much more .
i will not go back .
her reply `` no .
not good .
this is simply a customer service review .
gave it _num_ stars cause the wait staff was nice .
not even a ceiling fan in sight .
very bad purchase experience .
i would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products .
this is an older dick 's sporting goods location .
these a holes .
glad they have plenty of shorts to buy when its _num_ degrees outside .
convenient bank hours though til _num_ pm .
and i quickly remembered why !
forget the fact that mcdonald 's food is n't great .
we all know it 's not great .
world .
worst mcdonald 's ever .
this review is more for the repair end of bbb .
_num_ stars for being cheap and delivering .
the pizza , even when plain , is very greasy .
there are better options .
not my cut of tea .
i also ordered boneless ribs , which were pretty good .
not a lot of fat on them .
menu is very basic .
the patty was sorta flavorful .
giant eagle is one of pittsburgh 's more expensive grocery chains .
management there does n't care !
not good .
avoid at all costs .
arrangement was just ok .
Negative
the chicken nuggets come out under par .
i recently posted a photo of my chicken ranch club .
that has no chicken .
this is ridiculous .
try house of lee instead .
but when it does , you bend over backwards to make it right .
not at this place .
too bad .
leftovers .
do not stay here .
horrible !
i woke up with bed bug bites all over my body !
off to star nails we went .
Negative
terrible !
ordered two spicy chicken combos yesterday at around _num_ o'clock .
after taking her to another vet , i was educated about wound care .
after she was treated properly , she healed quickly .
he cried constantly when i left his sight .
hoping to get a different vet next time i took my other cat there .
you try holding a scared cat in a room full of dogs .
they do not care about animals .
disgusting .
this vet is only out for the money .
an average price , i 'm ok with that .
i could n't believe it .
i needed a cut so i went for it anyway .
almost all of the tires sold on site are foreign .
it was even slightly cold before i reheated it .
for a sandwich advertised to have delicious bacon , this fell way short .
first , i 'll walk you through my experience .
the clothes are priced far higher than other such shops .
nasty !
deciding not to get it , i placed it on a near by shelf .
they really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room .
just so bland !
my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich , which he loved .
when i picked up the sandwich grease poured from it .
not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby .
we will not be back .
not a fan .
it was a weird experience .
bad idea .
what a disappointment !
we had reservations for _num_ people at 7pm this past saturday .
when the rest of our group arrived ( on time !
she told me it would be awhile .
fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks .
service was rough .
bland food and poor service .
not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience .
went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition .
i probably will not return .
very disappointing meal .
salad was average at best .
when make turns , there is noise from front wheel .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
take a hard right down aisle _num_ and then you hit the bakery .
_num_ . )
from the bakery , you walk along a long meat wall .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
ugh .
walked out without making purchase .
some are very slow .
_num_ cents .
avoid .
employees are unhelpful and rude .
i wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy .
it was messy .
terrible !
the cut was terrible !
price : tasty is cheap .
atmosphere : typical chinese takeout place .
would i go back again ?
i ordered the kung pao chicken and crab rangoon .
not tasty at all .
_num_ .
first off , everything was dripping everywhere .
next up , the `` general tso 's bean curd . ''
very kind , gave me minor changes without question .
they most certainly sat in broth for hours .
they fell apart .
watery sauce , no heat .
just bad .
price does n't matter to me at all , though .
it was just inedible .
the crust is not homemade , pretty sure .
it was n't very hot either .
very inconvenient in a world where cash is pretty much on the way out .
olive garden seems like fine dining compared to this place .
not the crusty italian bread .
it was _num_ % breading .
for the entree , i ordered rigatoni and my fiance had baked ziti .
$ _num_ , including tip .
why not ? ''
it 's a gas station , how hard can it be ?
do not use their car wash .
horrible experience .
called two days later to confirm it was ready .
!
poor little guy .
bad shelter !
they kill more pets for space than any other pittsburgh shelter .
weak leadership .
i 'm very disappointed .
_num_ .
so beware , you are paying to dollar !
i was in a time crunch , so paid anyways .
_num_ .
so i went back first thing the next day , and showed the tailor .
it makes no sense .
the primary reason i used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions .
hence , i am now here , writing this review .
the times i 've been here , its been an ok experience .
ridiculous .
booked an appointment , and they fixed the issue .
i do not recommend .
fail !
something does n't sound right here .
the light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy .
i will not go back again .
a little pricey but whatever .
the coffee was just a little off .
no wonder mine was stale .
seriously , all the people here have major attitude problems and need an adjustment .
seriously , fuck this place .
i would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night .
i ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions .
buffalo blues was neither .
not particularly interested in returning for any reason .
bar food none too exceptional .
bad texture .
it really is a pittsburgh staple but come on ... .
food is really , really average .
it , technically is in shadyside so your mercedes will be safe !
want to sit in the bar area ?
to put it lightly ; the staff suck !
it pains me to leave any tip for them .
it is way too expensive .
food is very overpriced though .
and , its not good .
my husband and i went to buffalo blues last night .
after what seemed like forever , my husband got up to find a server .
i hate this place .
my husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap .
we will not be back .
the hot and sour soup was ok.
this is an average chinese buffet .
they said it would take another two hours to start work .
you should always have your car washed , specially in the winter .
avoid this shop .
this apple is too green to eat much less pay for .
my pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright .
i also tried the key lime cake and sour cream and apple cake .
while i 've been to better bakeries , i will definitely be back .
or the fact that you 'll save sooooo much money by being a member .
granted , it was a friday morning , but still .
and nobody smiled at anyone else .
unbelievable .
i do n't quite trust anybody else to help me properly .
naturally , i get an automatic voicemail .
cant wait until aaa calls me to renew my membership .
Neutral
i should know , i 've dealt with at least a dozen .
times , and it still is not resolved .
if you are in the aaa , you 'll know i 'm calling .
Neutral
i should know , i 've dealt with at least a dozen .
times , and it still is not resolved .
if you are in the aaa , you 'll know i 'm calling .
worst experience .
my soul purpose to coming here was to get my license picture taken .
not here .
complete waste of life .
horrible treatment .
seems like she do n't wanted to take care of the customers .
so i drove _num_ hours there on a weekend to renew .
fish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things .
do n't care .
very disappointing to me .
tried using the online order store pickup with the hopes of increased efficiency .
fail .
i really like this shop .
all the sales associates are extremely useful and educated .
avoid this place .
it is difficult to get in and out of their lot as well .
they hired people that had to be required to do certain areas correctly .
terrible dry cleaners !
poor customer service .
they also lose things , more than once .
simply awful !
as promised , they were ready monday after 5pm .
avoid at all costs !
instead of _num_ .
very rude and condescending .
and then there was another lady that was complaining about their service too .
i made an appt online for 6pm the following day .
refused all of those .
slow service and response .
not recommend .
that reminds me - the slices are huge , and are $ _num_ .
sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated .
i got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone .
went home , made some eggs , and guess what ?
i 'm not making this up .
terrible pizza .
just plain gross .
gross , gross , gross .
this was a mistake .
never again ... .
my appointment was at 8:30 am , i was on time .
i sat in the waiting room until _num_ am .
not cool !
and at least i put my cart back .
now it 's just more expensive .
try $ _num_ , for real .
you treat the employees like dogs - like one level above dirt .
Negative
even though i was only there one time , first impressions are a bitch !
the food : plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying .
i 'll stick with trader joe 's for my alternative market , thank you !
it really does n't hit you , until it ... hits you .
it 's why they have parking lots in the first place .
not cool .
overpriced and overwhelming .
do not bring your car here .
i spoke with brian at the desk who was very polite and professional .
sunday went by then monday went by .
wish me luck guys .
Negative
did they use the tea pot as an ash tray ?
the current tenant informed me that the roof leaked .
disappointing .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
would not recommend to anyone .
they have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly !
i do n't get it .
the food tasted terrible .
the new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night .
not a good vegan experience .
overpriced , salty and overrated !
no thanks casbah !
we were willing to try again , so we went for dinner tonight .
i sent that back , and ordered the sea bass .
- ambiance is nice , upscale , not too loud .
only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them .
- mushroom pasta : again quite rich and salty .
that was n't to be .
i 'm so disappointed .
wait time : we had a reservation , so we were seated right away .
not worth the price .
it is dark , so do n't expect to take any good photos .
heavy and bland .
)
- this really was the standout .
so , i had been wanting to try this place for some time .
it was awful .
sooo wrong .
thank god there were bottles of hot sauce and salt on the table .
i 'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over _num_ years .
learn from my mistake .
it 's never too loud or aggressive .
owners , please stick to your business hours .
... my vote is to just stick with the hours you created .
to be fair , our assigned server was very nice .
it just was n't anything special .
it tasted like nothing .
anything will taste better drenched in gravy .
worst tofu scramble ever .
if both of those conditions are n't true , then go anywhere else .
yep , that description of their `` chorizo '' comes directly off their menu .
but do n't expect that feeling here .
two stars because i really like the drinks here .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the food is bland .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i think pittsburgh deserves better .
if not , stay away .
i 'm not watching my weight -- i can handle it .
given the relative quick delivery , it was on the cold side upon arrival .
also , i had ordered a fried pickle appetizer .
we tried bbq , garlic parmesan and spicy .
rude .
rude .
rude .
and they are rude .
also the driver forgot to bring my drinks .
the vet met with us for a very short amount of time .
Negative
imho that 's ridiculous .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .

it is unfortunate .
just got off the phone with a lady from construction junction .
normally , i have had the best experiences there .
not anything like the pieces on the floor .
just thought you should know .
- the fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here .
customer service was a joke .
first of all , the gym in pretty cheap .
even a small crack with a few problems set on it .
the staff was n't very helpful .
it 's poor form .
they are n't rated properly , just easy , medium , or hard .
apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town .
i imagine less than _num_ % of expensive restaurants today are cash only .
very pricey food , cash only , average food .
these people could not care less .
)
ridiculous .
rude , unprofessional , and lazy .
it was n't the cut .
_num_ years i had this deal going on .
i was going to have so much done , too !
receptionists were beyond awful .
i booked _num_ style appointments in advance for a wedding .
he also went on to give me the fastest haircut i 've ever had .
poor planning .
and they smoke around the food .
service is incredibly slow .
not worth it at all .
once seated , i practically had to beg for a wine list .
as my boyfriend was talking with the cab company , a waitress walked by .
so disappointed .
sounds weird , but i never felt so rushed in a _num_ hour dinner .
not a spot of pink to be found .
just clear me out and get on with the next one .
crappy place .
everything else was yucky .
avoid !
my new goal is to deter anybody i know away from dollar bank .
i was totally underwhelmed .
the decor was junkie and old and cluttered .
i got a fill and a fix because i broke a nail .
one of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me .
i will not be returning again .
too over priced for mani and pedi .
terrible customer service !
but got the invoice three days before i got the estimate .
truly , you do n't need this kind of grief .
the quote was $ _num_ dollars .
needless to say .
sausage was disgusting .
i was absolutely horrified !
!
it seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant .
very disappointed .
would n't recommend at all .
the quality was horrible .
and the prices too high .
biggest waste of money !
i ordered a bacon pizza and breaded mushrooms .
that is completely ridiculous .
it was not good .
they can keep the other groupon .
makes me glad i live in new york city .
they gave me a nice receipt .
overall , not a great choice .
actually that is n't quite accurate .
she served the beer in a mason jar .
the food is n't fresh .
that 's total bullshit .
wo n't be back .
what was set in front me looked nothing like what i was used to .
what i was into was the german potato salad .
i was highly disappointed .
i really want to like this place .
it was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots .
reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat .
makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is .
do n't believe me ?
you need a new chef , immediately .
beware of the ketchup .
i 've had better meals at the complimentary continental buffet at the holiday inn .
my water glass had onion pieces in the bottom of it .
simply awful .
i have not a single good thing to say about this restaurant .
we ordered the turkey reuben that tasted funky on day old potato pancakes .
we also ordered max 's famous reuben , nothing famous about it .
worst .
everything ready in _num_ seconds because it sat under a heat lamp .
avoid at all cost .
potato pancakes taste like they had vinegar in them .
disappointed .
everything else was sub-par .
ugh .
about _num_ % more expensive .
i was very specific when i made my reservations several months ago .
but , hey , i can always catch up on my sleep tomorrow night .
just bad service overall .
i would n't stay here again .
horrible food , horrible service .
it was like getting a shitty breakfast in a local sub dive bar .
ron 's pizza palace is cheap .
on multiple occasions in the past , i have ordered hoagies from ron 's .
inconsistent again .
was going to try the buffalo pizza .
fortunately , i 'd gotten that info when i ordered .
at this point , i am done .
this week is the 3rd week .
pizza hut , a pizza of last resort .
_num_ .
_num_ .
really bad service !
horrible horrible service .
the food is okay - typical italian fair that could be better seasoned .
the shrimp and pasta , however , were cooked well .
of course it was good , it is fried cheese !
but it was nothing special .
prices were inflated for a limited valentines day menu .
do not go to this restaurant !
i will not be going back .
went for the first and last time tonight .
$ _num_ corkage fee for _num_ bottle of wine .
the restaurant is so small and they have a problem with managing customers .
they brought mussels instead of our mozzarella sticks .
but this was quickly corrected .
i give them a _num_ for presentation .
too late to back out .
one thing i like about the store is the proximity to my house .
but seriously , it 's like walmart stuff at whole food 's price .
when i want to cook pretentious gourmet food , they have every ingredient ready .
my recommendation was to burn this place to the ground .
the store never looks very clean .
i 'd recommend stopping in another giant eagle if you can .
waste of time .
all bad news .
i 'm too scared to shop there after dark .
like who goes from _num_ 's to _num_ 's in _num_ days ?
horrible customer service !
they had a dj so there was a cover of $ _num_ - boo !
my jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
however , i ca n't let this slide : your claw machine is bullshit .
the pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though .
i hope the owner or general manager reads this .
service is mediocre and slow .
waitress was ok in attitude .
manager embarrassed himself .
the service is terrible .
i have been here a couple of times and it does n't change .
i 've never had a staring contest with a hostess before .
it 's bizarre .
people from work drag me here to lunch more often than i would like .
i tried the seared ahi tuna .
maybe it 's just the built in crowd .
crab fries , naturally .
was n't the best either .
ca n't comment on any other time but this really hectic one .
not a degree above room temp .
limited menu .
the chopped salad had weird cheap ingredients like celery and carrot .
but now i 'm weary of the restaurant all together .
i ordered a hamburger with fries for $ _num_ .
very disappointed .
a party of _num_ , we agreed to sit _num_ and _num_ .
i was wrong .
no chicken .
not even one piece .
extremely disappointing .
mediocre at best .
went to easter brunch , was served some coffee from a can .
if this establishment were to be in any other city they would be closed .
this place is a fusion of olive garden and red lobster .
i was really excited to hear that they had smoked salmon .
however , when we got there the buffet was well picked over .
i was mostly wrong .
it came out of the kitchen with noodles instead of the potatoes .
but that should be explained by the waitstaff when someone orders the meal !
it is difficult to get under my skin .
house salads for the wife and i which were pretty standard .
that is $ _num_ month from august to march .
we will not be back .
the only downfall was their delivery time .
i tried pickles tonight for the first time .
i 'm thinking we 've struck out .
first of all , ordering was strange .
do n't do it !
you disappointed me .
i have been a steelers fan as long as i can remember .
so not cool steelers !
my friend lives near here so i came to satisfy my deli sandwich craving .
it was bad .
o my pittsburgh pirates .
another losing season .
what a disappointment .
they topped off my coolant for free and changed my oil .
which is pretty sad .
was so excited to get your pizza today .
wise guys is your typical off beat pizza shop .
there are other better pizza places in the area .
the place smells of smoke .
gross .
i get it , you wan na have a mom and pop shop .
mom and i both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese .
overall , it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich .
my son and i then tasted it ... understood the face after that .
no , just no .
they told a driver must have taken by accident .
terrible .
it 's a shame .
$ _num_ a week plus gone from them .
remember , the call was on speaker so i overheard both sides .
hard to contact .
also , alcohol in the air here too .
very disappointed .
poor quality work .
i would never use them again .
very disappointed .
ok atmosphere drinks are overpriced for the area .
check my purse , yes , but leave my purse with complete strangers ?
had a friend who went here .
the owner is the one who took my appointment .
i came in tonight ready to buy a bike .
i was really disappointed .
the only people getting help in there tonight were two other guys .
what a terrible experience .
disgusting & totally unsanitary imo .
i 'd go back for bottled beer , that 's about it .
it happens !
for $ _num_ with the owner .
i very much regret ever trying this salon .
when i arrived , i was seated quickly and greeted by a stylist .
this was my second visit and alas , my last .
as for my ca rolls , the avocado was all brown !
avocado is like banana .
not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever .
our first visit deserved a _num_ but this visit was a _num_ .
i would not recommend this place .
always seem to be people going in and out .
i only took _num_ bite and did n't want anymore .
the wonton soup i have to say though was very good .
the chicken lo mein and fried rice were okay .
nothing special .
the price was fair and the delivery driver was nice .
horrible food .
it 's hard to get a good chinese restaurant around pittsburgh .
terrible .
no .
she refused .
only once was it under par .
apparently they feel that frozen cakes are acceptable for events .
horrible place !
the location is n't ideal ; on the side of a busy highway .
probably not .
( old cereal and bread . )
some customers may like it , me , not so much .
my date ordered a hot sausage hoagie .
it looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich .
the dining room is also a bit cramped .
hungry patrons also are constantly getting up to visit the soda fountain .
for the money i expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza .
i guess a lot of people like it , and more power too them .
way too much cheese .
if answer is yes , then maybe this place is for you .
it is definitely not for me .
i do n't get it .
cold cheese and cold pepperoni on my pizza ?
no professionalism .
not a medium .
no way .
no no no .
no beer either .
terrible .
had this pizza been cooked , i feel like it would be subpar .
it does n't work .
man was this place packed !
rude .
i disliked the cold cheese and cold pepperoni on so so crust .
not comparable to the other top ten pizza joints in pittsburgh .
went for lunch for hoagie , fries and _num_ cuts .
would n't recommend .
my daughter and i ordered my pizza slices to eat in and hers togo .
after finishing mine , we inquired about our take out .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
terrible experience !
i do n't normally get my beer from there .
will not be returning .
mediocre and poorly made !
i was grateful for justin since he was the most helpful to me .
so consider my advice if you decide to purchase here .
this was done _num_ years ago .
my girlfriend and i came to have some dinner around _num_ pm .
support local businesses , but make sure they are deserving of your money !
poor service , crappy food .
cold .
stale .
bad idea .
we are never going back .
this place is sad .
fishy smell .
not fresh at all .
also did n't seem very nice .
very annoyed and ignorant !
!
and _num_ bbq dishes .
not hot at all ... .
server kim was awesome .
but kitchen has a lot of problems .
the variety of sauces is what gets me to come back .
i may come to have drinks , but never to eat .
you 've been warned !
it 's also really expensive .
it was a place where everybody knew my name .
i can not speak for others .
will never go back !
unbelievable .
pancakes were not very good .
average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive .
very small and uncomfortable .
dont fall for it .
i dunno .
it came with mashed potatoes which were definitely from a package .
i stopped in on a whim alone and sat at the counter .
i would n't go back .
urban spoon rated _num_ % favorite .
this pizza is not good .
not a dime every again .
it does n't feel fair .
not nice !
i am not impressed .
bland reheated samosas .
barely reheated naan .
obviously that feeling is long gone .
shockingly bad .
the old woman was not nice .
for an appetizer , _num_ entrees , and naan .
no drinks .
food was terrible .
all tasted like old food .
severely disappointed .
i ordered chicken curry .
the food is n't fresh .
_num_ $ for a plain roast beef forget that !
my guess is that it was that suspect sauce you put on that sandwich .
i ordered two chicken finger kids meals and two adult meals .
sadly really went downhill .
the bloody mary was pretty awesome for what i assume is a pre-made mix .
lame .
she also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average .
everything is basic with a large price tag .
there were _num_ of us .
it was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese .
it was a disgrace .
disappointed .
worst waitress ever .
could n't remember anything .
husband ordered penne chicken vodka sauce .
it was runny and bland .
would not go back .
the same plain pizza we order never seems to taste the same .
noise level -- painful ?
i 've been wanting to stop in here for the longest time .
delivery guy was shady too .
i do n't recommend at all .
however once opened not so much .
Neutral
i have never been treated that way with any owner of a business .
unbelievable .
got a bang trim , a low # _num_ cut , and a wash .
she went ahead started to cut my bang after looking at it .
are you kidding me ?
* no shopping carts .
salad will come first , then a couple of dogs , then fries .
the waitstaff all seems to think highly of themselves .
fries are nothing special .
however , check the price of a beer before you buy it .
shame on me .
are you kidding me ?
after calling every day for a week i was furious .
awful customer service !
she was sooooo rude .
she took me into the room of dresses and said to look around .
then , in june , my maid of honor calls me .
not even close .
fast forward to july ( _num_ weeks before the wedding ) .
worst dry cleaners ever .
turned out to be way more hassle than it was worth .
shame on you cathy !
Neutral
the whole burger just tasted like nothing .
it was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries .
rather disappointed .
i met my friend jean here , she is a once a week customer .
i chose a veggie wrap , sans cheese with a side of apple sauce .
so why my low score ?
never going back .
all i can really say is that she was a real ball of sunshine .
worst service .
slow .
bad !
real bad .
i want to know what to expect , you know ?
)
they do n't use their space well .
tables are often dirty .
i asked for my money back .
disgusting .
does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge ?
i would beg the owners to put any effort into this place .
i asked for a pen , not a kidney .
but they use the cheapest meats they can find and you can taste it .
no reply .
just terrible .
just go elsewhere .
not even remotely convenient .
are employees required to be grumpy here ?
they all look like they hate their job .
the managers do n't care .
nothing special .
i said no thanks .
i hate complaining like this .
but sometimes , you just have to , ya know ?
very disappointing .
we love japanese steak houses and this was our least favorite meal in pittsburgh .
it tasted more steamed than hot grilled .
not good .
by the time they were cooked , everyone was finished eating .
that does n't say too much for the rest of them .
there is way better hibachi in pittsburgh , for a lot less money .
this is totally unacceptable .
the horrible location ?
the horrible location ?
the restaurant was n't even half full .
we feel completely cheated .
very sad .
i just hate to see it .
compared to other restaurants this is my least favorite .
the chicken was also extremely dry .
it was really disappointing .
i was mortified , my boyfriend was mortified , the waitress looked mortified .
shame on you benihana .
dirty place and horrible service .
loud is an understatement .
i just have n't been impressed by anything i 've ordered there .
the food was also not too good .
i will not be coming back .
it 's hit or miss with this place , but mostly a miss .
horrible service .
it was loud , but expected that on a friday night .
described as being served with butternut squash , brussel sprouts and cauliflower .
sorry , bummer .
this was explained to us before we ordered .
have n't been here in a long time because the service and food suck !
not worth the trip .
i am a ten minute drive from this location .
i attended the sushi class on monday night .
not laid out well .
rude cashiers .
store is too small and always crowded .
had a beer and an appetizer , so-so .
was n't the best experience .
ugh .
at eat n ' park , free cookies are a staple .
this place was not packed .
while waiting , i used the ladies restroom .
does n't anyone come and check this ?
came back and dropped them off and left again .
the fries are very salty .
rude !
i only went here because i had a groupon .
huge mistake .
off to sams ... .
so , i am assuming they were delivered by a neighbor .
guy on the front desk has the attitude problem .
the people all look like they hate their jobs and treat the customers accordingly .
there 's nothing fast about this fast food .
received bad service today .
we left einstein 's because it was crowded .
my dad would always take me to this place when i was little .
Neutral
instead of the amazing tomato bread i got plain rye .
if your seeking genuine medical attention i would strongly suggest another facility .
their service is terrible .
i was ; however , charged for the basket .
do n't order from this shop if you want a timely delivery .
have mixed vincent 's .
just goes to show , it depends on what you order .
we could n't eat it .
probably wont go back .
pizza was good but really expensive .
breadsticks and meatball sub for my mother .
it was n't fresh at all .
when i was little there was always enough donuts for everyone !
they know they sell out before _num_ and they only open at _num_ !
as mentioned by others , this road is not in the best shape .
surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business .
kmart is doing okay as is the giant eagle .
walking through this mall just creepy though .
going here is like being in a time machine though .
man , the rent has to be so cheap !
honestly i do n't consider this place a mall .
this mall is dead !
the mall that is nearby is not really a mall .
there are also not many place to eat around the hotel .
i hate olive garden .
i ordered food that i believed was gluten free .
avoid at all costs !
ever !
thats as american as fortune cookies .
after pasta , comes the protein , that includes meatballs , then finally salad .
her ex must have ran , not walked away from her .
rooms were clean and the amenities were fine .
i only stayed one night and was charged twice .
they are not concerned with quality of courtesy services ie shuttle and breakfast .
something just feels wrong .
avoid .
checkin was seamless as it should be .
i was so mad .
the tv was definitely a _num_ 's model .
the worst .
do not stay here .
Negative
extremely disappointed .
i explained to her that this has been going on for weeks .
horrible service .
junk worse than mcdonald .
store is open until 2:00 .
she asks employee to scale back .
he refuses .
horrible service !
today i gave them _num_ chance .
it 's sad .
service is terrible .
horrible service and food .
it 's not hard .
do not recommend .
the baristas are not friendly .
rude .
real bad .
no no .
and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee .
it is not daily normal , ordinary dirt .
i 'm _num_ .
but you know how some dive bars have charm ?
i was thinking this place might be like that .
woman takes off my toe nail polish .
surprised someone has n't been hurt yet .
i really was sold at one point .
so please , i trust you to just make me look hot . ''
i hate that !
i 'm not a hair stylist .
wrong !
first , i feel like they pull the prices out of thin air .
my husband gave me a gift certificate for this salon .
that 's why i 'm looking for my cup now .
rude .
very disappointed .
will not return to this place .
in addition , they offered me tea , coffee , or water .
i wandered in here looking for a pedicure .
very sloppy !
i would put _num_ star if it was possible !
very limited color selection .
very poor quality work .
i 've gotten my nails done quickly before though and had much better quality .
this is not the first time either .
is it terrible ?
however , i can order a salad with french fries on it .
ca n't win 'em all , right ?
ridiculous .
a number of the reviews here giving off the `` eh '' vibe ?
finally - a halfway decent tv setup , pittsburgh !
my boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and i got a cheddar burger .
he said the stir fry was so-so .
it was just so-so .
no redeeming qualities here .
it was hardly edible .
the buffalo pierogies however , was a total miss .
will not be back .
pirates , steelers , penguins etc ?
$ _num_ burgers , $ _num_ domestic bottles .
we waited for the server yet again after asking for drink menus .
absolutely nothing arrived in a timely manner .
our meal basically met our admittedly low expectations .
she thought the potato side was just so-so .
the decorations look like they 're straight out of an _num_ 's music video .
and def not as good !
so she asked for a little more from the server .
_num_ dollars for _num_ people .
unfortunately we did not .
it was not even blackened .
fish market needs some lessons on hospitality and diversity or new management .
terrible crab bisque .
the food was awful .
seriously , terrible .
just all around terrible .
it actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright .
i 've been meaning to go back to the fish market for so long .
ugly .
ugly .
ugly .
it was n't good at all .
so i know it 's an off the shelf thing .
but the quality just does n't match the price .
first time i 've eaten here i went during lunch time .
you 're probably asking why order that when at a fish market .
the girlfriends sushi meal was a bit over priced for a lunch menu .
two basic rolls and miso soup for $ _num_ .
crappy hostess for sure .
it does n't change much .
they get maximum money for average seafood ( or anything else ) .
sub-par sushi .
the rest was dry .
it was disgusting .
we sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room .
not good .
the menu was pretty random and everything we tried was really average .
the drinks were n't anything special either .
never been before and went on a thursday night at 6pm before a show .
i 'm sure it is in the liquor license application .
not my scene whatsoever !
smoke bomb disappeared !
i was pissed .
extremely disappointed .
i 've been going to this bar randomly over the last _num_ years .
but the attitude of this place could be better .
the flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box .
obviously , if you choose to patronize this establishment , pay cash .
i could have saved a lot of money and time and done it myself .
do n't bother .
while here , we sampled the blueberry mojito and the cucumber basil martini .
the blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum .
ok , i 'm in !
i figured wrong .
i ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side .
when it did , it looked ok .
it was very disappointing .
however , i 'm mainly rating their food and service .
very disappointed .
it was frustrating .
overall , very disappointed .
but the positives stop there .
completely bitter and disgusting !
we both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps .
the restaurant has carpet which i find off putting .
the food was mediocre .
visited with a party of _num_ last weekend for a friend 's birthday .
can you say awkward ?
we were seated , and had to wait awhile for service .
not a fan of the service .
guess the men at olive or twist only like men .
no acknowledgement when we arrive .
the sauce was disappointing .
we 'll feed these to our dogs when we get home .
avoid this tourist trap !
first time in pittsburgh , from chicago .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
why does n't the schedule know this ?
for shame !
well , it does get one from point a to point b in pittsburgh .
i have been riding the bus for as long as i can remember .
one year after they cut that route after being there over _num_ years .
its only been in new york and dc for years !
getting on and off is confusing .
when to pay is confusing .
the service is n't frequent enough .
the subway system only goes to one neighborhood from downtown .
sucks , sucks , sucks .
on an _num_ degree day one buses heat was on full blast .
not the drivers fault .
buses are late all the time .
port authority sucks !
they also cut back bus services and lay off all these bus drivers .
pathetic !
the bus number is _num_ .
i wish someone had informed the port authority of this .
_num_ . )
singapore had this for their buses in _num_ !
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
i waited two hours today in the freezing cold to get to work .
had to call off it was just to cold out !
so why not actually make a decent public transportation system ?
it varies bus by bus , time of day , and more .
big league cities need big league transportation .
_num_ stars ?
okay , i 'm not from pittsburgh .
nothing was dry ?
half my dish was potato .
there was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu .
_num_ fights broke out while we were there .
i rented a car with this location as the drop off point .
i became very angry .
why did n't i get paid then ?
i 'm not from here , so maybe i do n't share the love .
i recently ate a _num_ oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint .
worst sandwich on earth .
oh primanti 's , you always disappoint !
_num_ these guys can never seem to cook their fries properly .
_num_ the bread .
gross !
so i guess if you want an authentic pittsburgh experience then go here .
a native sent me here , an apparent pittsburgh landmark .
my first time at primanti bros in pittsburgh , pa .
i think with some mustard this might have been great .
it was dry .
when i told people i was going to pittsburgh , everyone recommended primanti bros .
i do n't like coleslaw .
just get fries and coleslaw and put it in your sandwich .
the only flavors were vinegar and pepper .
the sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive .
ordered a grilled chicken salad , take out .
i was quite underwhelmed with this restaurant .
she just disappeared again .
i had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it .
i was really annoyed .
what a disappointment .
boring sandwich .
the service was terrible .
sit back down and i 'll take your order . ''
it was unbelievable .
utterly , totally unbelievable .
i ca n't for the life of me figure out why all the hype .
but i 'm a tourist here , and wanted to try it .
it was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries .
he gave me big time attitude and commented that i took it apart .
disappointed , big time .
tonight was my second attempt here .
no more tries here .
if you like sandwiches with french fries piled on them , go for it .
it 's not fair for the customers or for the servers .
_num_ stars for history , _num_ for food quality and flavor .
in total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food .
i stand by my decision : pass .
'
had such high hopes for this place on our visit to pittsburgh .
worst service ever .
gross . )
my first visit was to the one in south hills .
waited _num_ mins for _num_ sandwiches .
this time i got the grilled chicken salad .
it 's not much of a cheesesteak .
i chose poorly .
highly disappointing .
bland .
coleslaw was a lot better with the hot sauce i smothered on it .
the beer makes everything tastes better so order at least two beers before eating .
i 'm not a big foodie but i like my food taste better .
horrible !
will never return to any location !
service was bad .
highly disappointing philly cheesesteak !
ok then , how about i just have a diet pop .
before she ran off , we ordered our meals .
it was just strange .
outside of the bread i ca n't say it was memorable in any way .
basically , this place is like dr. pepper soda .
ok , i get it , your busy .
nothing to write home about .
i 've been to _num_ different primanti locations and each one just seems greasy .
place sucks .
rude !
not worth it .
very bad foods .
very bad service .
they were rude .
i do not recommend this place .
the only seasoning available are salt , pepper , hot sauce , & ketchup .
big disappointment .
hate slaw but tried it with slaw anyway .
nothing special .
way too much coleslaw .
nothing special .
so , i got a turkey sandwich with the coleslaw and fries on it .
they really overload the sandwiches with coleslaw and french fries .
i end up picking half of my sandwich apart .
ugh .
it 's just bad .
came here after a _num_ 1/2 drive expecting the best sandwich i ever had .
on the other hand , the fried pickles were great .
and the wait staff were awesome .
also , parking was shit .
this place really did suck .
it is not .
disgusting .
guests always mention they ca n't wait to try go here .
i dread it at this point .
wrong .
never going back .
the food sucks .
you will leave smelling like cooking oil .
horrible customer service !
but the dipping sauce for the tots were on point .
skip it .
it was all bread and coleslaw .
it was grilled chicken , french fries , a little cheese on chopped lettuce .
the bread is _num_ % of the meal .
not so much .
upon entering you are immediately greeted by pure chaos .
they sit on tables and often just sit at your table .
they sit on the tables and often just sit at your table .
i think this should be more like _num_ stars .
the preparation instructions seem questionable ( microwave in a plastic bag ?
finally they figure it out and give us the roasted chile .
oh wait though .
it 's horrible .
did they bite off more than they can chew ?
the food and drinks are very over priced for what it is .
omg what a nightmare .
the second time , though , was tonight , valentine 's day .
but , our waitress was helpful , and our food came out pretty quickly .
the bleu cheese dressing , though , tasted pretty good .
the staff is rude .
just all around disappointing .
went to this place for lunch last saturday , party of five .
horrible service and horrible food !
my husband and i went tonight for dinner .
bad mistake .
busy , slow and awful .
i 'm not a beer drinking novice .
bland .
service gets _num_ stars and food gets _num_ stars .
overall , this place gets a _num_ stars .
then again , we were in pittsburgh , so it 's a given .
extremely slow service !
service was horrible .
the lunch took _num_ hours .
it was not .
it was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top .
not worth it .
just awful .
what a complete disaster .
we were both craving seafood , and had never been here before .
this place was terrible .
the seafood tasted old .
why on earth did i go back to this restaurant ?
with _num_ waitresses .
the fish was hot and crispy .
poor service .
went on a wednesday night , not crowded at all .
service was just awful .
no he did n't !
service was terrible .
brick oven pizza cold ... .
steak was way over cooked .
and this was an early lunch with very few customers around .
are you kidding me ?
that 's not a lobster roll !
and trying to get our check ?
ridiculous .
tried thin man , closed .
our _num_ drink and lunch took over two hours to complete .
diner _num_ - ordered the lobster roll sandwich .
bland and awful .
diner _num_ - steamed clams .
diner _num_ - ordered the salad with the lobster roll , hold the bread .
sent the mussels back .
if _num_ stars were possible i 'd give em .
just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off .
suggestions , hmm not entirely sure since nothing i ate here impressed me much .
never again will i spend money in this place .
they had to be cooked prior to us ordering , or even getting there .
the burger was just eh .
no hostess coming up .
so , needless to say , not the best experience .
overall , my experience was okay .
we got the scallop appetizer and it was to die for !
i will _num_ % go back for that !
the beer choices and the casual menu was right up my alley .
ca n't recommend the place .
they were cold but did not taste fresh .
i would be hard pressed to ever return .
stopped in on the fourth of july for evening cocktail and small meal .
mussels were freezing cold .
this place is terrible .
spend your money somewhere else .
she brought our soups , which luckily had spoons in the huge bowls .
poor excuse for seafood !
the place is gross !
i liked the bar .
this lobster was dry and chewy .
lots of it , though i guess that accounts for the high price .
then the other day , we went back and i tried pizza .
they may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a saturday night .
it was disgusting .
what a nightmare .
visited on a friday night and it was pretty crowded .
not worth the bucks .
service is just terrible .
just awful .
the restaurant was too busy .
the bathrooms were atrocious .
it 's never horrible .
huge portion .
they used real garlic and it was served with it - minced .
looks better than it tastes .
my salad came out shortly after the appetizer sliders .
no bueno .
the person next to me ordered the beer battered giant fish sandwich .
no fish .
terrible experience here .
it was awful .
on wet cardboard .
maybe i just ate the box ?
it was n't even crowded .
my bf got the steak with battered shrimp .
no stars !
great shrimp cocktail but i wish i had my fish sandwich across the street .
lobster roll was dry and salty .
i see why this place is hurting for business .
literally disgusting .
ordered the lobster mac n cheese as an appetizer .
for dinner i ordered the pan seared scallops with red mashed potatoes .
then , my brother got the prosciutto and arugula pizza .
it was nasty .
my chicken sandwhich was also made with rubber chicken .
horrible experience .
-i split the giant beer battered fish sandwich .
i tried a bite of it .
the waiter was terrible .
i would not recommend them .
so why just a `` _num_ star '' rating ?
terrible service !
what a horrible experience .
thankfully , our later stops were much better .
the mashed potatoes were great , everyone agreed on that .
the bathrooms were disgusting .
terrible tuxedo rentals !
oh , and its very very expensive !
dark roasted , bitter , etc .
rude .
what i received was a whole milk latte .
but this is n't what i ordered .
rude .
so very rude .
it 's sometimes tough to get waited on even with nobody in the store .
cheap gyro combo = cheap tasting meal .
they are open late hours , so sometimes that can be handy .
it sits in the warmer cases , and looks `` crusty '' .
owners should know how they are being represented at the front register .
it is cheap food , and you get what you pay for .
it was very cold inside the restaurant .
my husbands pork was a small portion .
it was very inexpensive and i understand why .
my dad and i walked in around _num_ pm on a friday night .
sucks .
why post a closing time if it is n't honored ?
this is an odd little cvs .
this was my first time trying brown bag deli too .
i hated it !
please ... .
!
oh my god ... .
this place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising .
overall the food was hit or miss .
the bill was way too high .
Neutral
i ordered the chicken kabob .
i did n't finish it .
the spinach pie was ok .
i will not go again .
better than nothing , i suppose .
too slow service .
annoying waiter .
_num_ ) the owner is pushy .
_num_ ) the portions are small !
_num_ ) the lemonade is _num_ % ice !
_num_ ) $ _num_ tip even though the owner is the server .
i had spaghetti and meatballs and a caesar salad .
find something ... anything else ... it is going to disappoint .
no thanks .
disappointed .
in fact the room we sat in had approximately _num_ open tables .
just my _num_ cents .
the service was mediocre .
it has gone downhill badly .
we will not be going back .
thank you for your feedback regarding your visit to spaghetti warehouse .
your comments have been sent to our general manager , christopher beers .
just getting our drinks out was confusing .
for our dinner , we were given a salad , entree , & tiramisu .
there was a list of _num_ or so entrees we could choose from .
i could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar .
i 've never been to one & was really excited .
while this is happening , several waitresses come to the bar to get drinks .
i was a little salty with her , i 'll admit .
maybe _num_ % full !
they made us wait simply because they ca n't staff correctly .
as my review makes clear , i ca n't compare the food .
you ca n't screw up pasta -- it would be very hard .
not terrible .
the worst service ever .
total waste of money .
it was like getting waited on by 1st job people .
it 's tacky too hot .
im from california and was excited to experience this restaurant .
not worth the $ _num_ .
worst place ever .
we hopped this was a one off and not typical .
nothing i had tasted good .
just skip it .
nothing special .
service was incredibly slow .
i probably would n't go back .
our garlic bread came out literally black .
we will not be back .
i wish it were possible to give this place _num_ stars .
they 're wrong .
i 'm not italian , but i cook way better than this myself .
there was a little bit of a wait which is expected on saturday night .
the service is really spotty too .
baked ziti average .
dont like too soft pasta , al dente preferred .
i was not impressed at all .
i of course had filet , and i was just so underwhelmed with it .
they are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation .
gone is the famous gm bill .
changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks .
the meat was n't special .
wow , not so much .
very strange experience .
the food was bland .
nothing to write home about .
the food was not good .
his side of mac and cheese was laughable .
i ordered steamed broccoli and he ordered mashed potatoes .
$ _num_ side dishes .
if only they could train their employees better .
there was mildew on the floors of my bathroom and bathtub .
the sofa looked old and was not comfortable .
there is also a _num_ inch ?
i never used the sauna , so i can not comment on that .
this is rather expensive as well .
such a shame .
it was made of wood .
finally , someone wandered in from the back and rang up our items .
i guess all customers are n't equal .
not worth your money .
i was exceptionally disappointed .
managed very poorly .
6am is too early for her .
that 's _num_ % .
she never even looked at me .
rude .
not hearing me , she goes , `` what was that ? ''
managed very poorly .
6am is too early for her . ''
seriously lady , you 're not a morning person .
would n't come here again .
they simply did n't care .
she also used the same stick the entire time which is not sanitary .
eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at $ _num_ .
do not go here for waxing !
my order was $ _num_ .
i got nowhere until i asked that a count of the register receipts .
that was not acceptable to me .
this is not giant eagle !
never shop at this asian grocery since many more open .
not anymore though .
so gross !
also , parking is a big problem .
finally on tuesday , i came out to the shop at _num_ am sharp .
i tried on the dress and it was super short .
other than that , it needed hemmed and taken out just a touch .
imagine my frustration .
unsatisfied customer !
for $ _num_ plus delivery ?
i stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go .
when i received my order i immediately opened it to take a bite .
it was all beans and guacamole .
it all snapped into place for me one day recently .
not impressed .
gross !
but i 'd suggest you not !
texture and temperature of the fish scared me .
first of all , foods were n't impressive .
it 's really frustrating .
it was gross !
it had a huge hair in it , all wound around the crab .
totally disgusting .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
total waste .
sushi is not overpriced although the rolls could be made better .
i was there on a monday , so i just tried the sushi .
vegetable roll was good , but not exceptional .
still , would not recommend .
will not go back .
that should have tipped me off .
i ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu .
my food was terrible .
that is simply lazy .
this place was awful .
mine was just disappointing .
i also thought it was extremely over priced .
never been here before .
disappointed in that .
what reason would a restaurant serve water in a plastic cup is beyond me .
Negative
korean barbecue requires either the patron or the server to cook at the table .
i will give sushi kim another chance because i know others rave about it .
the wait staff -- not too pleasant !
service is slow and horrible .
so disappointed .
the menu is blah and the food is also .
the service here sucks .
it just sucks here .
it 's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer .
i 've went for _num_ years now waiting for it to become something good .
i waited .
)
ordered , is not .
the bill .
it was my anniversary tonight , a tuesday .
i was so excited to get all you can eat crab legs !
very disappointing .
not impressed .
i stopped by here this past thursday night with three others for dinner .
mediocre at best .
rode my bike out to meet my old man .
but seriously , there are still restaurants that allow smoking ?

battered and fried .
the food sucked .

Neutral
it looked rather like a barber shop .
thumbs down !
did n't go so well .
they then brought out two manicotti dinners which were fine .
who serves a drink without ice ?
our entrees , dessert and coffee all came out at different times .
avoid !
i ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce .
not worth the price .
the decor is very plain .
it 's just not that good .
the food could have come from a buffet and been better .
she had zero personality .
wrong !
never again will i go there .
i 'm a guy , i 've got a short haircut .
nothing fancy -- short on the sides and back , an inch on top .
fairly average italian food other than the meatballs .
interior could use an update .
the food quality does n't match the place at all .
i had the chicken flatbread and the chicken was more like subway chicken !
zero stars .
worst .
with that said , i opted out of the calzone .
i may try the pizza but other reviews noted it was pricy .
i could have done better at home .
next time i 'll try morton 's or capital grille .
extremely disappointing and appalling .
we were seated and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable .
fail on all levels .
horrible .
never going back !
our bill was over $ _num_ .
tip was $ _num_ .
what a disappointment .
poor , slow service .
this place is horrible .
i brought my boots here to get fixed .
not handicapped accessible .
wrong .
after i ordered , the waiter came back twice .
there was the powder parmesan on the table which i added myself .
get me out of here !
the place is empty .
i mean , empty .
i took the olive oil off the table next to ours .
so , i 've tried this place _num_ times and that was enough .
it was just meh .
all i could taste was citrus .
Negative
negatives : the lighting , the decor and the smoking .
so i left .
the selection here is stellar , but the prices are ridiculously high .
even whole foods is less expensive .
the truffles had two salted , one of which was milk chocolate .
this is just my experience .
rude !
inside is just average quality , equally average priced produce .
cheap , everyone seems to say that .
we were greeted very warmly by one of the ice cream technicians .
the technician was telling us how it was closed and had just reopened .
the character of the place was great but could use a little tlc .
the menu was very small and hard to read and understand .
i ordered mine , chocolate , and cried vanilla .
_num_ sundaes were $ _num_ .
too bad .
this place is terrible !
ugh .
skip it !
really disappointed !
we had the same experience when we walked in .
however i agree with the previous reviews that the staff are killing it .
tasty , but not real butter pecan .
i waited until _num_ and knocked normally so that it would be heard .
worst customer service !
truly pathetic .
do not stay here .
you will be disappointed .
no upgrades .
not personal at all strictly business .
the better restaurant is the little cafe across the street owned by same owner .
to get a cab walk to the westin across the street .
no hello on entering .
not friendly .
not a _num_ star .
really a _num_ star .
nothing to recommend .
do n't walk away .
eventually , i had to get my project manager to resolve this issue .
the desk ) until i 've given the room the all clear .
i could n't have been happier !
my second room : same line , 3rd floor , also accessible .
that 's unacceptable .
shower shoes , i never leave home without them !
i ca n't wait to check out .
it was off .
i literally walk past this subway _num_ times a week .
what a wreck .
rude customer service .
my gripe here is that i ended up with scratches on my wheels .
plus i was served teriyaki fajitas .
i could n't believe it !
it just was n't a great environment .
_num_ stars .
soups were borderline offensive .
bad !
went to _num_ tavern for lunch a few weeks back .
second i was with a party of _num_ that all ordered salads .
overcooked and cold .
the place was empty .
every time , the hotdogs ( and brats ) are harder than a rock .
not worth the trip .
the bread was just sliced supermarket bread .
rules made by men .
not my favorite .
a place i would go back to but not regularly .
the food was terrible !
we quickly found out why .
this is a very small irish pub .
are you gon na eat that ?
terrible .
the soda was flat .
why did n't we just leave then .
worst restaurant ever .
wo n't be back .
i will never be back .
definitely has the local irish bar feel to it .
$ _num_ credit card minimum .
no bathrooms .
this represents a real problem for the city .
this place was horrible .
it smelled awful inside .
it was quite crowded .
not good at all .
thus station needs more amenities and a makeover to compete with the dc one !
do n't miss the _num_ pound tub of msg as you walk in .
the place was more of a hole in the wall then i can appreciate .
cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality .
never going back .
it 's not worth it .
it was horrible .
do not use this dry cleaner .
ehh ... it 's not all that .
cold cuts were good though pricey .
Neutral
_num_ .
highly questionable hygiene for a food store !
disgusting .
i have a idea , get rid of those cashiers , fire them !
needless to say i walked away .
obviously she hates her job , then get another one !
every january i buy _num_ months worth of cheese for my family members .
extremely poor service .
Neutral
we are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup .
tables were not very clean .
not acceptable .
i 've only eaten here once before .
just order from one of the two sites i listed above .
i walked out !
i remember the waiters attitude more then some of the food .
lidia 's does high-end traditional italian without being too pretentious or too predictable .
lidia 's is an upscale olive garden with slightly better wine list .
the biggest problem ?
everything is bland .
they have a salt problem .
the tomato was hard as rock .
just bad .
bread is awful .
just in the way it is laid out and with the choices .
the concept is just so olive garden .
i just have to wonder why lidia would create a menu like this .
it just does n't match her books or shows at all .
their menu does n't include really any .
the service was not very good .
not so much .
i had a bite of a chocolate torte , and was very impressed .
it was not spicy .
and was really disappointed .
another disappointment .
and thus my rating of meh .
i was horrible .
soooo disappointing !
i watch lidia on tv and have a lot of her recipes .
then , i ate here .
are these the same people running this restaurant ?
guess not .
too bad .
one word ; gross .
i get better shrimp pasta at macaroni grill !
what an embarrassment .
for salad , they only served `` caesar salad '' .
the service was horrible .
rude .
however , seconds never came .
however she charged the $ _num_ pasta trio ( which comes with desert ) .
i was expecting $ _num_ + $ _num_ salad upgrade .
ugh .
avoid !
what a disappointment .
would not recommend it .
i ate here when it opened , a and again _num_ years later .
nothing has changed .
it 's tough to find anything good here .
the menu offerings were spotty .
gnocchi and duck ragu was what i ordered .
i was very disappointed .
ate at this resturant while on a business trip .
i would probably not come back .
lidia 's was one of our favorite italian restaurant in the city .
she had to check with kitchen several times to answer our questions .
second , our food was served just barley warm .
we will not be back .
nothing to talk about .
for my entree , i tried the lasagna recommended by the waiter .
calamari was not fresh .
caesar salad was drowning in tart dressing .
horrible .
pasta trio was bizarre .
only passable pasta was the pear & ricotta ravioli .
waitress walked away two times while opening our bottle of wine .
( $ _num_ + $ _num_ ) .
for the main course , i selected the gnocchi and grilled sausage .
the sausage was made in-house and was very flavorful .
not very tasty .
not same price .
i had the pasta trio .
the caesar salad was fine , but not inspiring .
the three pastas were very , very basic .
i pushed it away ugh !
do n't be fooled !
try their calamari over angel hair yum !
lidia should be embarrassed .
grilled octopus : where 's the octopus ?
what a huge disappointment .
our server was nice but rushed .
lidia should spend more time in her restaurants to see first hand .
the waiter said she only comes to town twice a year .
very disappointed .
most likely will not return .
granted , the calamari and shrimp that were there were cooked perfectly .
risotto , while one of my favorites , is n't pasta .
there are fruit flies hovering around our table too .
the pasta with chicken was about the best from the trio .
it 's an ayce trio .
we were ... disappointed .
the duck breast was under done .
so disappointing ... .
the information for this restaurant needs to be updated !
last week my husband and i visited pittsburgh for a rock concert .
i ordered the pasta trio , and my husband ordered the risotto .
not exciting .
it was pasta , after all , one small serving of each .
the bartender does n't belong in the business .
a turn off .
first off , it is desperately in need of some updates .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ big screen tvs .
i was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual tvs on each table .
plus , beer was _num_ !
upstairs looks like it 's a club at night .
it is a white pizza with minimal ingredients except for the lamb skewers .
standard so-so pittsburgh pizza .
better luck next time .
ordered two personal size pizzas , spicy fries , fried zucchini & onion rings .
tastes plain & over cooked .
delivery : horrible experience .
she promptly explained that the internet was down .
and , apparently , delivery .
it was all kind of meh to me .
there are better restaurants in pittsburgh .
i would be careful ordering food here .
disappointed !
unacceptable .
but i could n't eat it .
are you kidding me ?
horrible !
i was then transferred to housekeeping where i was constantly sent to a voicemail .
i did n't hear back .
the pittsburgh auto show was held at the david l. convention center .
children _num_ and under are free .
domestic beers were $ _num_ .
that was frustrating !
it was pretty busy and there were people everywhere .
still , i think there are newer hotels that provide the same .
we got this hotel room via hotwire at a great price .
parking at the hotel is expensive .
completely worthless wifi .
we have stayed in westin hotels all over the country .
the tv movies did n't work ?
two seconds later , they come to want to clean ?
so gross .
the pool is strictly a lap pool .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i ordered the turkey blt with lemon aioli and arugula salad .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the wi-fi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good .
rude front desk staff .
the ac barely works .
_num_ stars .
but maybe they 're not even trying !
again this is pittsburgh not philly , dc , or ny .
disappointing at every turn .
the beer is cheap .
i should know better than to have high expectations .
the two jumbo fried shrimp were ok.
nothing but breading .
ugh .
however , they have several cooked selections .
styrofoam plates and plastic forks .
cash only is really customer friendly as well .
i 've had the fried oysters before , and they were pretty good .
this lunch kinda sucked .
a native all my life and never been , finally went last summer .
totally gross !
this restaurant is horrible .
i found this restaurant online and in my hotel room magazine .
i 've never seen it somewhere stating they only take cash .
are u kidding me ?
i am disappointed .
imitation crab & lots of filling .
so i was like dang !
my return is questionable .
first thing they said to us was , we only accept cash .
if a cold beer is all you want , go for it .
this place is a pittsburgh legend u got ta stop in .
just checked it out for the first time .
i was the girl who came in tonight , alone , around 8pm !
avoid at all costs !
i do not recommend this restaurant .
the fries were generic .
long wait time for initial service and drink refills .
not much oyster taste , just the taste of the breading .
i could n't eat anymore .
avoid .
this place is awful .
had the gyro and added feta .
bottle of coke had icy slush in it .
zero stars .
female manager on duty asked for $ _num_ in exchange for a pizza .
she should probably get fired .
the pizza at this place is o.k .
the meat in the steak sandwich was like dog food .
it gets packed .
i 'd never had the food before .
so gross .
the last _num_ times getting it , i have had issues .
i can not eat this .
very disappointed .
will not go eat there again !
this is a very odd restaurant .
the first thing i ordered was a bowl of lemongrass soup .
gross .
we will not be back .
was just rude .
first thing i noticed is the place was an absolute sauna .
i ordered the lemon grass soup with shrimp and the papaya salad .
i would not order this again .
but then i got my chicken lemongrass soup .
terrible terrible customer service .
i 'll probably not be back .
there was just one table of _num_ seated and eating when i arrived .
and , a table of _num_ leaving and all paying separately .
the food came out quickly enough .
i settled with the thai fried rice with beef .
there was a ton of thai basil in the dish which was quite overwhelming .
i chose the hot and sour soup .
i decided to play it safe and ordered the broccoli in garlic sauce .
random pizza toppings on lettuce ) this time around .
just awful .
ugh .
way overpriced and service was n't great .
no taste at all .
somewhat generic , but the espresso gets the job done .
it was quite small though .
you know , standard italian hoagie .
i substituted steamed rice for the fried rice .
it was like an old sweet an sour sauce with a little spice .
gross .
the food was unremarkable .
avoid this place .
confusing , and a pain .
down the street is a better option - wish they were open for lunch .
looking back , i am glad it happened that way .
items seem overcooked or undercooked .
i could n't even finish it .
i ordered a long john which looked pretty good .
unfortunately it was n't .
i ate maybe a bite or two before offering it to a coworker .
she showed me two options and i chose one .
it was also very dry .
they said they had an appointment to taste wedding cakes .
i had small cheese steak sub - asking only for mayo and lettuce .
but no .
mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix ?
i am paying almost _num_ bucks for this sub .
yes , bland .
bad sauce with flavorless cheese .
two and a half dollars more is not a little .
wrong again !
swimming i tell you swimming in grease !
will not be coming back .
bad service !
avoid at all costs .
reviews but they let me down .
i am disappointed .
i can not review the food .
the woman who answered the phone said yes to both so i rushed over .
completely ridiculous .
terrible .
_num_ star average ?
ugh .
mediocre at best .
worst delivery service .
no way , dudes .
go down the street and get some tastier food at tram 's kitchen .
i 'm not joking about the water .
pho broth takes like nine hours to make .
based on all the other reviews , probably safe to stick to pho .
if you have an emergency , go to the vca castle shannon animal hospital .
for everything else , try the cat clinic .
i start work at _num_ am .
i do n't need to receive attitude from a receptionist .
it was a mess .
an expensive mess .
i stop in every week for it .
last week , i got a large and went back for more .
but , lately it 's been hit or miss .
if your not a chain smoker , opt for takeout .
the bar reeks of smoke and the bar table feels sticky .
this place is terrible .
carpet looks really dirty .
no flavor .
very disappointing .
trust me , you 'll be glad you did .
sadly , i was disappointed .
and he had a cd setup -- seriously , cds , in _num_ .
the bar food is typical .
no thanks .
there are other italian grocery stores close by .
atmosphere was bad .
i 'm weird like that .
it 's just generic stuff .
like i said , olive garden , only local .
it 's not my kind of food , or place .
it looked a mess .
my boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl .
the beef pho was sub par .
for starters , the portion of the pho is extremely skimpy !
seriously , would it kill you to add more rice noodles ?
let me tell you , this place is a big let down .
the restaurant setting is very typical of a vietnamese restaurant .
then we had _num_ different kind of pho for our main entree .
there was also excessive msg in the soup dishes .
the food is cheap .
at tram 's , the pho bowl is small .
the taste is reminiscent of pho but is n't quite right .
this was n't it .
it was dark and crowded ( and a little bit dingy ) .
bad service , bland food .
do n't believe the hype .
another sour note , they dropped off some spring rolls at our table .
later on , we saw them on our bill .
tram 's kitchen in my opinion is not really worth it .
the portions were really small .
very disappointed !
this is the worst .
also questionable tofu in the vegetarian spring rolls .
i ordered the beef vermicelli bowl , one egg roll , one spring roll .
my husband and i stayed in pittsburgh for weeks and wanted to have pho .
egg roll and fried rice is too greasy .
service is not friendly .
wrong .
the entire restaurant could use a thorough cleaning .
never a dull moment .
finding a good ol ' diner in pittsburgh is n't exactly easy .
worst food in pittsburgh .
wrong !
_num_ but i rounded down .
cheap , average diner food .
it 's disgusting .
the food is crap .
so , i came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast .
based on this one experience , i would come only for the pancakes .
located in not such a great part of town .
the wings were dry .
the only items that are good there are the bacon and toast .
it would take less than _num_ day of their time .
their chicken is better too .
a few of us went out after late night bowling to get some food .
and the bathroom looks and smells like something out of the movie saw .
no need to be nasty .
typical diner look and menu .
!
puts it into a glass and serves it to someone else .
soup not hot , waitress and cook fighting loudly .
i dropped off my standard prescription today , with the head pharmacist .
the salad was basic iceberg lettuce and a few other veggies .
this place is trashy .
not much for atmosphere .
this place is hyped as the be all end all of burgers .
the reason why i rate this place low is the atmosphere is abysmal .
i 've had better burgers almost everywhere .
i dropped them off while i parked the car .
the burger was pretty good but , i 've had much better .
nothing special here .
never understood all the hype about this place .
i was disappointed .
i had a bacon cheeseburger and it was okay .
i did like the home fries , very yummy !
it 's not .
not even close .
oh but it 's not .
it 's not me .
it 's just not that good .
this was my first and last time at this restaurant .
the home fries were just diced potatoes .
the decor is old school and seems satisfied in it 's current state .
i had the kelly burger and it was just extremely massive and greasy .
if that were the case , i 'd stick to making my own .
baby on board , we walked in and waited to be greeted .
this was not the case .
mediocre food and mediocre service .
_num_ of us came here for dinner and ordered burgers and drinks .
they also have a wind problem every time the front door is open .
food is ok but the service is a thumb down .
i would never come back .
for me , eating at tessaro 's is like eating a costco hotdog .
maybe i should cut down on the costco dogs ?
terrible service .
was really excited to try this out .
did n't wait long to be seated .
i 'm used to ordering medium and getting medium well at least .
it seems as if this place is now more hit or miss .
even worse , no seasoning whatsoever .
probably not .
no effing way .
i went to this restaurant saturday for the first time .
Positive
i walked in sat down , greeted by friendly staff and great decor .
it was very crowded due to little italy days in bloomfield .
would never consider going back .
there were nine people in the bar section .
just awful .
my boyfriend and i went to dinner here last saturday .
my alfredo was tasteless .
this was really disappointing .
i went out with three others on a friday night to grab some dinner .
crispy on the outside , creamy and cheesy on the inside .
everything tasted like nothing .
i will not be returning .
_num_ stars for plate glass window people watching !
i had the linguine carbonara and it was more like scrambled eggs and noodles .
bland noodles .
( this becomes important later . )
they were significantly cheaper .
nobody else even ordered drinks while we were there .
the mattress was borderline uncomfortable .
my room came with an awesome jacuzzi .
there is no excuse .
it opens at _num_ .
not a good first impression .
not good .
thankfully they give it to me without further lip .
total for one waffle cone with sprinkles = $ _num_ .
not here .
make sure your opening and closing time is listed correctly .
it was generous for the `` _num_ scoop '' order .
in the future i 'll stick with scoops for my neighborhood ice cream fix .
coming here was usually pretty exciting .
( here as in the city , not silky 's . )
i was not even acknowledged .
this was a moderately steady thursday night .
they would n't look at me .
`` ill tell the waitress . ''
me : `` please may i just have my beer ? ''
it 's extremely frustrating .
no thanks .
just there last evening after a _num_ hour shift at work .
the server apologized and offered to get the correct sandwhich for me to go .
not impressed .
he talked loudly across the whole restaurant to staff members back in the kitchen .
so , yeah , the smell .
you play russian roulette with your quarters every time .
lol is the most expensive laundromat i 've ever been to !
the front staff is very curt and short .
for my car the average oil change runs about $ _num_ .
avoid at all cost .
terrible experience .
i went to jiffy lube for a routine oil change .
very bad service .
they are extremely slow .
this place sucks .
very long wait .
very very slow service .
jiffy lube sucked .
took over an hour , cost $ _num_ , broke my air filter .
no thanks .
too busy with your iphone ?
plus i think i found a fry or two with the vegetables .
also lot _num_ had some funky smells throughout the time that we were there .
service could have been better .
i might return for drinks but only drinks .
the food is bad !
boring .
entree _num_ : beer battered fish and mac and cheese .
entree _num_ : fish tacos .
the attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream .
the chef , however , needs a bit of training .
i am hoping that my experience here was an off night .
not my scene .
we ate breakfast food at 2:30 am after the bars closed .
it just is n't for me .
i could not even eat one !
ugh .
i am so disappointed .
disgusting .
do not eat here .
so pissed !
the sign says it , the looks of this place are not the best .
disappointing .
eggplant parm was a little better than average .
i 'll admit it , i 'm already an italian food snob .
is this what italian food in pittsburgh has come too ?
not real italian .
imitation crab meat at an italian restaurant does n't fly .
i was n't really a fan .
i 've made much better at home .
my girlfriend ordered chicken alfredo .
do n't expect fresh food .
i had visited this restaurant in the past and remember it being much better ?
it was a small side salad of iceberg lettuce and croutons with italian dressing .
what i received reminded me of mrs grass soup .
really bad italian food .
i have n't been back .
Negative
what a disappointment .
the salad was nothing special .
this place was horrible .
i was very excited to try this place .
i agree _num_ % on maggie g 's review .
ill pass i 've had better thai for less .
the carrots and broccoli was cooked beyond recognition .
ordered the eggplant with shrimp , veggie fried rice , and chicken satay .
the place was very busy and noisy .
the wings were awful .
the sauce they were drowning in seemed to have almost a chemical taste .
the shrimp were perfectly cooked , though , and i was thankful for that .
my favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno .
they also did away with the _num_ cent wing night .
very strange place .
just meh sorta flavorless .
good place _num_ a large group to drink get apps tho .
went to getaway last night for famous fajitas .
at noon on a friday i called getaway to place an order for wings .
i told my friend to forget about it .
what an awful experience .
my steak hoagie was actually two mini sandwiches .
i would n't recommend it .
sorry chef jeff .
absolutely horrible service .
no thanks .
it 's not 5-star , it 's pizza .
stopped by fiori 's , have n't been there in years .
the pizza was just sweet without much other taste , almost like ketchup !
the pizza was just ok .
sure , it 's friday a busy night so an hour seemed reasonable .
after that , everything else is what i consider the personal taste part .
that was really unprofessional .
it was disgusting .
i removed the cheese and just ate the crust with the vegetables .
garbage !
the cheese is almost too much .
i was quickly greeted by paul - who was great !
then shortly after , i needed to replace the alternator or the like .
monday , tuesday and wednesday came and went .
_num_ .
first , their clothing is arranged by color , not by size .
was n't worth it for me .
parking sucks .
just really lots of junk .
get the diagnosis and get several estimates to compare .
it seems like all these hvac guys are out to take advantage .
my house is under 1,000 sf .
i feel ripped off .
same goes for the provolone wheel .
the bread was not fresh either .
so i contacted this bakery for a wedding cake approximately _num_ months in advance .
what a nightmare !
the cupcakes were average at best .
brutal .
terrible !
it was like pizza soup in a crust bowl .
this was our first time trying this place since moving to castle shannon .
the pizza was really really greasy .
we also got an order of _num_ hot wings .
they were pretty terrible .
completely unprofessional and ridiculous .
none of this is exaggeration .
only _num_ stars .
worst mcdonalds !
someone needs fired !
service is always slow .
every mcdonalds has employees that hate their job , but never show it .
i hate this location .
worst service ever !
heck no !
worst experience ever !
hostess was great , service was adequate .
the food is terrible .
ugh .
terrible food .
disgusting food .
third terrible .
the entrees are horrible .
never going back .
it was that bad .
my hope is that they fix their problems .
avoid at all costs .
i would n't go back .
Negative
will never stop here again .
horrible , rude service .
_num_ minute wait for fast food ?
however , every times i drive thru pittsburgh , i always stopped here .
furthermore , i have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce .
shrimp was hard to chew .
i suspect this is probably made by the guy who station the fryer .
i could n't eat it .
takeout is gross .
interior is dark and dated .
it was my last time , i will ever stop again .
stopped in with my daughter we just wanted something small to eat .
i have been a customer of sesame inn for many , many years .
never ever get the all-you-can-eat .
they give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi .
my son and i stopped by china gate after a movie in the galleria .
i refused .
there is such a thing as food too fast .
too bad .
i was a bridesmaid very recently and the bride got her dress here .
there are plenty of other bridal salons that would be much nicer and accommodating .
think twice people before going here .
update : i received a very much appreciated phone call from the owner today .
she stated that she would go ask to see if something could be done .
the bride chose a dress hoping it would look better in a smaller size .
it was also fairly small , but that was almost to be expected .
we also shared a pasta dish which was incredibly overpriced .
we also had a serious problem with the timing of the food .
hmm a bit misleading .
but my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted .
the blond hostess refused .
as for the food and drink , it was just fine .
essentially three pieces of toast with various toppings .
way overpriced for just ok food .
the food was prompt , and the salad was more than enough to share .
the pizza was simply ok .
our pizza was burnt .
it tasted like charcoal .
probably give it another shot but not my first choice considering the prices .
i ordered the margarita , sauce , cheese and basil .
i may return if craving a good caesar .
we will not be going back .
friday night is apparently not the night to go .
the food i ordered was penne alla vodka , which was pretty tasty .
but for $ _num_ , and that 's all you get ?
very rude .
worst service in years .
unimpressive food .
overall , not impressed .
i really like the pizza and marinated vegetables .
no salad .
no meat .
no dice .
better deals and better food at a mall food court .
$ _num_ for wedding soup ?
$ _num_ for gnocchi ?
no more .
so disappointed .
it does n't make sense .
with all of the fabulous choices in the south hills , pick another destination .
first thing i knew was iffy was the meat and cheese plate .
they replaced the normal wooden board , and replaced it with a plate .
food remains ok but prices have more than doubled .
waitress has n't checked on us in half an hour .
ridiculous .
way too over priced .
i 've been wanting to try this place for awhile .
the bread was thick and doughy ( clearly a filler ) .
i eat out almost every night of the week .
it doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine , it is very chinese .
and i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant .
i expected bland sushi .
but hey , it 's pittsburgh .
the food is ok but it is really more or less chinese food .
the sushi was not fresh .
their ginger dressing is unbelievable .
miso soup had an odd taste this visit .
our waitress was mia most of the night .
it was fried tofu in soy sauce with red pickled chinese chilli .
so disappointed .
we ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi .
a group was sat without the reservation ahead of us .
we have been ordering food from little tokyo for almost _num_ years now .
horrible .
the locals that like this joint must have smoker destroyed taste buds .
the flavor of the dough is generic and salty .
the dough was also fairly dense .
some good some bad .
even burger king does n't microwave their breakfast !
odds are , you 'd get a better experience at home .
such a shame .
i did n't care .
i sat in the little snack area and drank it .
food is n't that great .
lots of tv 's though .
the ambiance is a little strange .
the service was terrible .
sorry , not sorry .
avoid at all cost .
at the time , it was the premier cigar shop in the pittsburgh area .
last week i went in with a busted window screen frame .
i guess because the big box stores are cheaper and maybe more accessible .
very disappointed .
the galleria ... it 's definitely catered to the upper class .
Negative
no call , nothing .
it was horrible .
yeah , that 's why i booked one at your salon .
online , their women 's haircut price is quoted at $ 30+ .
so go there instead is the best advice i can give .
for many , many years i had the same massage therapist .
wait which i left to run some errands .
it looked horrible .
i felt horrible .
this place sucks .
weird experience .
i chose a sugar cookie and mexican cookie .
the mexican cookie was just the same consistency .
sorry buds !
the customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers .
it 's always dirty .
it 's like they hate their lives .
absurd .
horrible experience .
the salespeople are not pushy .
the team went out of their way to get us in quickly and efficiently .
we called about the issue and they sent someone over right away .
my overall point is just be careful working with them .
and not giving real receipts ( they use hand written ones ! )
started with the bathrooms ... rarely cleaned , rarely working .
i 'm not a coffee snob i can do with it or without it .
but it seemed like i was absolutely bothering the staff this morning .
i 'm not a shady side hipster but an average person in workout gear .
felt like i was in someone else 's hood .
get over yourselves people .
the drinks are not so great .
the frozen carmel coffee drink was much better than fruit smoothie .
it was gross .
so i decide to try a coffee tree for once .
i walk in , look around , look at the menu ... hmmm .
minus _num_ stars for not being much better than starbucks .
its connection is also very spotty .
)
that 's about where the positives stop .
wifi is spotty .
espresso is pretty bad .
this place is out of my dry cleaning budget !
its owner , gary , enjoys parking in handicapped parking spaces .
this time , the staff were new , loud and mean .
the damage was done .
so disappointed !
i usually do both dry cleaning and wash and fold here .
will never return to the store .
they offered me nothing .
i could have gotten a better wax at a cheap nail salon .
my eyebrow still has n't grown back to its normal shape .
not worth your money !
this place is awful .
water temp on the chair got too cold too fast .
absolutely horrible customer service .
as for beverages , they really skimp .
price was as i expected for a nice looking salon .
gross .
she was clearly in a hurry .
they booked me with a guy by the name of jason .
that 's about as far as it goes though .
the haircut was $ _num_ .
but that 's apparently the way they do it .
i was disappointed .
please do not give them business .
do not use this cleaner .
quality is poor .
customer service is poor .
this place is extremely overrated .
i had the chicken ramen soup for a main course .
it just was n't very good .
this includes the broth and the chicken .
dear pittsburgh , we are foodies from boston .
it 's unacceptable .
a restaurant like just should be nowhere near your top _num_ .
i would prefer to leave _num_ stars .
drinking scotch in pittsburgh has been fun so far .
went to soba to celebrate my sons birthday .
last i had the vegetarian curry dish , the only vegetarian main i found .
it was very cold .
it was not enjoyable .
a pulled pork appetizer was passable , nowhere near the dish it replaced .
find a new chef quickly .
very very disappointing .
thai corn soup jumbo crab ?
pad thai at a fusion place ?
tandoori salmon was average .
why were n't their any ice in the glass ?
maybe it is really just me who prefer cold sodas .
... another one bites the dust !
wrong !
it was horrible .
sadly , i was grossly disappointed .
and fallen far .
it 's just not that good .
nothing special .
service is sketchy here at best .
first off , i can not comment on the food .
_num_ after tip .
it 's good , but too expensive .
the portion is too small .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i mean really loud .
rolls small lacking substance .
boring and expensive .
however , i 'm in pittsburgh , where can i go ?
these place are virtually the same .
okay bagels though a little overpriced .
really turns me off .
the coffee 's terrible .
poor customer service .
it 's all crap .
do you like egg & bacon bagel sandwiches ?
just like the butter and jelly packets sitting in the booth at denny 's .
i 'm not kidding .
worst place ever !
we also tried the hummus which was pretty good .
friends ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken salad .
she returned not long after and said she was alright .
i really could n't believe this .
what the hell ?
but it was n't over .
only because i live nearby .
mmm not too happy with my recent experience at harris grill .
harris grill , i think your menu is trying too hard .
first place i went on my visit to pittsburgh .
bland and overcooked .
avoid harris grill .
the waitstaff go out of their way to not help you .
we stopped going after we got some serious attitude from our waiter .
i do n't enjoy doing it .
almost every time i have been let down .
$ _num_ for two fish tacos ?
i do n't hate anything on the harris grill menu .
sure , harris grill gets crowded , especially on the weekends .
but truth be told , i 'll probably be back .
zero stars for service .
zero stars for price .
service remained poor .
not so much .
terrible .
and then the waitress only brought two of the three beverages .
the menu was prix fixed at $ _num_ .
my eggs benedict was good , so was my bloody mary .
there 're not much options on the menu .
so i was in need of a lunch and off to the garden .
two grape size tomatoes , and two thin slices of cucumber .
the only option for brunch is to get the buffet .
_num_ .
_num_ .
very hit or miss place .
it was calamari on top of some salad with thai chili sauce dressing .
it is just disgusting .
i stay _num_ blocks away from harris grill .
terrible terrible service .
ugh .
horrible experience .
will not be going back ever .
so completely frustrating .
the equipment would often break down and never get fixed .
terribly overrated .
the reason you would stick to this gym is the classes .
there has to be better gyms in the area .
terrible experience !
very disappointing and frustrating .
gross much ?
update ... shadyside inn refunded the charges from our stay .
great location but low on amenities .
hot water , not much of it low water pressure as well .
pros : it 's like living in an apt .
some of the staff has been friendly in providing things , including shuttle rides .
we stayed at the shadyside inn for months and spent thousands of dollars .
do not stay here .
nothing special about this place .
well , my update has half of my original rating .
makes no sense .
the balsamic vinaigrette was straight vinegar .
butter served with the bread was so hard it bent the knife .
pity .
it was god awful .
there is an ok number of beers on tap .
my reuben sandwich was just okay .
my lil heart fell .
the menu is boring .
lettuce was ice cold , nearly frozen .
this place is hit or miss .
could not have been more patronizing .
i went into dean of shadyside salon to get my hair colored .
are you kidding me ?
wo n't be back .
this explains why i got my haircut there so many times .
overall , my haircuts were never good .
so bad service .
due to 3-4 hours of service i split it into two days .
terrible !
the receptionist can not handle tips at all .
terrible customer service !
this is not an exaggeration .
overall , haircut & style = _num_ stars .
mani = _num_ star .
the next time i returned , i made an appointment with a different stylist .
and each time i 've gone , my haircut has been ... .
)
i tried dean 's because i had a coupon for a free hair cut .
he was very busy working on multiple people at the same time .
i was there for over _num_ hours !
- i will take my aunt to asians or school in north hills .
it was more than once that i heard glass breaking .
weekend : dont bother .
not a lot of character , but cheap prices .
i use to pass by this place all the time .
this is a neighborhood denny 's with a bar .
ca n't comment on food since i was just in for beers .
hot sauce was more difficult , took two requests before it came .
the food is basic and inexpensive , you get what you pay for .
so clearly lil off there ... other then that we order common breakfast .
horrible brunch experience .
the food was terrible .
i would recommend never eating here .
was n't great .
it was n't even super busy .
for _num_ girlfriends , they brought _num_ joint check .
being a pastry chef myself , i had to try it .
i did like that the almonds stayed crispy even through shipping .
i ate one slice , and gave the rest away .
the cake part is now dry ?
go back to the way it was done before .
shame on you .
not best cake in america by a long shot .
i 've experienced better '' ) because i have .
they were sold out at 2:00 pm on a thursday .
no thanks .
i was given a _num_ dollar gift card .
the chocolate was too sweet .
horrible service .
i miss the old owner of the place .
pitiful service .
the salad has been greatly reduced in size .
cutting too many corners .
simply gross .
( all same kind of cookie ) .
apparently old cookies are standard here .
it is absurd !
his staff is embarrassed .
if not , oops !
i only go in to buy six packs .
hummus is ridiculously expensive .
juice is cheap .
drama , drama , and more drama .
the entrance to this location always smells like spoiled milk .
so incredibly frustrating !
i woke up with a stuffy nose and in need of some hot soup .
gross !
plus i did n't feel great !
the small package was _num_ dollars .
selection of veggies are ok .
this is my third grocery store stop of the day .
`` again i ask oh really is there nothing you can do ? ''
the aisles feel more narrow than they should be for a store this size .
wo n't be back .
none of that .
same goes for milk , cold cuts and breakfast meat products .
instead of about _num_ '' _num_ '' it 's about _num_ '' thick .
i went there for a few grocery items along with some alcoholic beverages .
_num_ hours to find the cold remedy i wanted .
guess not .
i never really understood why doc 's was so popular .
i personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck .
my feet were still rough .
to be smooth after only one pedicure . ''
excuse me ?
it was horrible .
she just kept trying to cover her ass instead of listening to my concerns .
disgusting .
does n't even deserve one star !
tiffany prices with kay jewelers selection .
we were disappointed .
but also way over prices .
really disappointing .
the food is poor .
did n't finish this dish .
my wife had a chicken special .
boring .
bland .
overall :
not a good start .
disappointing .
not a good start .
_num_ .
_num_ .
reservations at 7:00 pm saturday .
very rude and unacceptable .
never going back .
ravioli , chicken breast , sauteed greens and a seasoned broth .
the owner has a complete disregard for customers and the customer experience .
they should be serving free meals to anyone they stick at that table .
what a horrible experience !
the old guy continued to drink wine and yelled at another waitress .
so be aware they added an automatic _num_ % gratuity to the check .
very poor management .
very stupid management .
come for the food and not the atmosphere or service .
i made reservations for _num_ pm on a friday .
also , i was surprised by the limited number of seafood options .
treated badly .
the owner gave that table to a local group who showed up after us .
basically , reservations mean nothing here .
apparently it was a list of people that needed to be seated .
so extremely rude .
can not justify giving money to someone who runs their business in that manner .
really though someone had to have messed up my dish .
the food was decently made and the environment was welcoming .
most restaurants charge per bottle , not per person .
not off to a good start .
i will not be coming back .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
overall not impressed .
so bland .
_num_ stars .
_num_ star .
by this time , i was through with this place .
i got the beef , the chicken & cilantro and the spinach empanadas .
with all that said we tried all _num_ flavors of the empanadas they offered .
i 've only gone because it is convenient to my location and reasonably priced .
find someplace else in bloomfield .
they were returned to me a full size smaller than i dropped them off .
not very complicated .
will not be returning .
it was returned with a hole in back of suit jacket .
i just ca n't imagine having to deal with this a year .
the minus : the maintenance staff is always around .
Neutral
terrible !
a year later , the ceiling in my bedroom began to leak .
they do n't c are .
horrible !
not worth your money .
bathroom leaks atleast _num_ times a month .
very common problem in these apartments .
cant wait to move on .
the rent is too damn high .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it is not worth it .
they just broke into my house without any notice to show around .
then , before i was able to say anything , they broke in .
ridiculous .
Negative
)
, but instead they decided to take advantage of my position .
i do n't know .
first of all , and the most important thing , they are not honest .
elevator always has problems .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
wondered into this place looking for some mixed drinks .
but too much pamela 's seems greasy .
it 's like breakfast at most any other diner .
first off , i kept hearing about these pancakes i got ta try .
they were super buttery ... too much so .
too bad .
ca n't beat it .
for pamela 's , we gave it a shot .
the restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables .
way too rich to finish .
not deserving of the rave reviews .
the waitresses were extremely fast , except for coffee refills .
they are super thin and crispy on the outside .
there are a few of them and there 's really nowhere else to go .
it 's sad .
it was average , but not restaurant quality .
done in less than _num_ hours .
granted , i like to host social events .
so here comes the story of walnut capital .
- chuck the driver for the shuttle is cool .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of walnut street .
my party and i left to go to another restaurant .
however , the crepes are extremely over price .
so over price that i can not afford a drink .
i 've chosen never to eat here again due to the staff .
we were in a hurry because of limited visiting hours .
but i still cant get over the fact there closed on mondays .
i looked at my boyfriend who checked his watch while i checked my iphone .
Neutral
who on earth could possibly find this place worth returning to ?
i made an appointment weeks ago .
i said i could n't .
just totally inconsiderate .
beware !
when we arrived there , however it was a different story .
just getting off work , i came alone .
the walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass .
this was sorely lacking .
not professional at all .
they were not met here .
try panera bread across the street .
if any of the employees would smile i would die from shock .
do n't use the drive-thru .
no less than _num_ minutes .
big corporate america places only get one shot w us .
swing and miss .
the drive thru line is always too long and moves too slowly .
my moo shu chicken was mostly cabbage .
we used to visit this place most every time we went to pittsburgh .
Negative
dim lighting that makes me want to sleep .
it 's not romantic , just dim .
my minimum tip is $ _num_ , even at the cheapest places .
the food is only okay .
never ever whatsoever !
price is not bad .
not all her fault .
there were bugs in my egg drop soup .
i ordered two orders of soup hot and sour and egg drop .
i only eat the hot and sour the night we ordered our take out .
disgusting .
it reminded me of a cheap college place .
it tasted nothing like pork , or meat for that matter .
wrong .
cardboard .
after an hour of waiting , i called to check on our order .
horrible .
crappy service and food .
could not eat it .
there is nothing chinese about the food !
terrible service .
our food was cold .
very disappointed .
worst chinese food ever .
i 'm still trying to figure out how one manages to burn noodles .
this place is disgusting .
it tasted rotten and disgusting .
i picked out the broccoli and ate it over my side of rice .
we ordered just soup and eggrolls for takeout .
i will not be ordering here ever again .
_num_ woman in the store were very helpful and knowledgable .
too pricey for the quality .
while it has a somewhat trendy looking menu , do n't be fooled .
service was horrible .
very slow .
food was mediocre .
crab cakes were awful .
just said to try back again !
completely disappointing .
not too shabby .
salads , sandwiches , burgers and entrees we have all had before .
i had the walnut crusted salmon sandwich and jordan had the reuben .
french fries are pretty standard .
the food is lousy .
they just are n't nice .
delivery time was unimpressive .
otherwise , probably not .
man were they wrong !
we ordered a large steak stromboli with extra cheese through grub hub .
not even worth a star .
the hot wings i ordered came as plain breaded wings .
i put some hot sauce on it strictly to add flavor .
my stomach was in knots for hours .
the good : the ladies who run the registers are personable and helpful .
my big issue is that the employees stand directly outside and smoke .
i also plan to tell my family and friends not to shop here .
terrible service .
very cold to watch a game in even buy usual local rink standards .
they 'll try to hit you with a bunch of unnecessary repairs .
i have driven _num_ miles in the car since beginning of september .
_num_ which seems to be a never ending construction zone .
the pizza was really greasy , and the bacon was minimal .
avoid .
worst nail salon ever .
not a smart move on my part .
it 'll never dry !
this made me question whether or not she was professionally trained .
what a complete waste .
i had a mani pedi today and they were brutal ... .
so painful !
i would like to stress again though that my feet look awesome .
do not get married here !
ash trays all over the bar .
linda did not call .
just called to get information for my son 's birthday cake .
i bought pastries at this place several times before .
this place is run by korean women who are interested in providing extra services .
i visited here at 6:30 p.m. on a saturday night .
first sign i chose to ignore .
nothing updated , nothing new , nothing fresh .
second sign i chose to ignore .
he was loud , very loud .
he was not asian .
white , and very loud .
third sign i chose to ignore .
perhaps leftovers from the _num_ steakhouse sale .
the tree died .
the salesperson walked away and proceed to start helping other customers .
she paid top dollar for the tree because she believed it was guaranteed .
she received neither .
the service was poor .
sounded like i was flying a helicopter .
these folks are not honest and just want you out of there quickly .
this place has gone down hill fast !
the staff makes it feels like you are bothering them when you order .
cold food ?
this is nothing new .
this has always been my least favorite wendy 's .
ugh .
is that too much to ask ?
for a store the size of giant eagle , i expect more .
third , i 've personally had issues with meat quality here .
but kayla , our cashier ?
completely unacceptable !
all right , now i 'm really done .
they did n't .
ridiculous .
i will not be back .
why every time i come in here , it 's really hot ?
why every time i come in here , it 's really hot ?
better than subway , but not jimmy johns .
very rude staff .
i do n't mind them being cash only .
i 'm begging you .
he was very kind , but only dropped my food off .
the menu says there 's a charge for fried rice instead of white .
the atmosphere was atrocious .
it was awful .
the staff was rude .
that was insanely rude .
we were so excited to try this after all the hype .
got chicken with string beans ( $ _num_ ) take-out .
the chicken was slimy and not many pieces at that .
go to sesame inn in north hills and other locations .
after a lengthy wait we ended up sitting at separate tables .
also , very expensive !
hand me my order and cash me out ! )
we ordered spider sushi rolls , hawaiian chicken , and general tso chicken .
i 've had way better chinese sushi at giant eagle of all places .
yet , he still drew blood and several yelled codes to the techs .
money trouble ?
my cat is not eating .
thanks , but no .
so rude .
it tasted like hot chocolate .
just not going back there .
who cares what i think though , everyone has a different taste .
i have n't been here in a long time .
i should 've known better .
um , not me , thanks .
i 'm nothing if not organized .
but for those considering a long distance purchase , just beware a bit .
big mistake .
as noted by other posters the waitress was the bartender .
i get the same meal constantly and pay different prices everytime .
terrible service , rude staff .
avoid this place .
ordered a glass of wine and beers for my companions .
sent one of my companions to get me some water .
this place is terrible .
she did n't refill drinks .
not very appetizing .
bad night ?
like two weeks ago when i stayed here for three days ?
you get off the elevator on the 5th floor .
not so great ?
the hotel subs out the services for the business office .
not a good idea .
one of the people working said that was probably because of `` renovations . ''
i think they probably deserve better .
there were tables and servers ?
bad planning and execution ?
avoid !
avoid !
i walked in and was a little surprised .
i will never be back .
the front waiting area was in mass confusion .
this pizza hut is not a top choice , but ok in a pinch .
i had my _num_ year old with me and i 'm _num_ weeks pregnant .
service was horrible !
the food was awful .
tables were dirty .
well ok i guess .
never going back .
ball within the already limited selection .
i only give it _num_ stars because of the wait staff !
it is ridiculous !
they need to find new wait staff who are attentive and friendly !
obvious they could care less .
i could get food faster in a prison cell .
most fast food places fall in the the meh category for me .
avoid !
horrible !
i have spent a lot of time at shooting ranges both indoors and out .
sweating at the lanes while trying to hold a loaded gun .
no bueno .
the lighting was poor .
my biggest complaint is pricing .
most indoor ranges charge by lane , not person .
the bathroom was gross .
same guy , same attitude .
if you 're desperate for chinese , get it to go .
we got the curry chicken , beef with broccoli , and crab rangoons .
get your wallet ready , the prices are crazy high !
nothing to brag about .
here for trivia night on tuesday night .
my acrylic nails are crooked and shorter than i asked .
the staff 's attitude is straight out of the big apple .
what happened ?
parking is atrocious .
just awful customer service .
we were disappointed .
she was appalling and rude .
another $ _num_ .
this is on a weekend ( saturday night - sunday morning ) .
i 'm glad this place is for emergency service only ( for us ) .
i will not be going back .
no thank you .
they ripped me off .
this is the burger king that corporate forgot .
king nasty !
just awful .
the last time that we went there he had our car for over week .
i have n't use their service yet .
i stopped by to see them , asking them to give me a price .
no return call either .
do n't bother .
food was awful .
szechuan beef tasted like ketchup .
the chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful .
chicken chewy and rubbery .
the installers were knowledgeable , friendly and efficient .
so frustrated .
they came out on a sunday which is much appreciated .
i booked this hotel stay for a business ( military ) event .
we booked a total of _num_ rooms with them and checked in individually .
the room had a musty smell to it .
she did , however , return quickly with a hair dryer .
the breakfast area was incredibly crowded .
they said if i printed it out , i could have used it .
made me walk across the floor after my pedi w bare feet .
gross !
nails looked nice but only lasted about _num_ and a half days .
unacceptable .
just chunks of tomato .
we got two hamburgers and an order of chili cheese fries .
and cheese sauce that you get for your nachos at the gas station .
i have been here a total of four times .
the portions here are huge ( the one constant ) .
ended up just getting plain strips with honey mustard on the side .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
most places charge _num_ to _num_ dollars .
so much for trying to support local business .
it 's not .
holly on the way to _num_ .
every order is wrong .
what 's worse ?
nothing changes even when they are n't busy .
avoid this location .
most time i wait so long i end up going inside .
they charge for internet service in the room , that 's so _num_ !
answer : pretty bad !
we booked this hotel to stay during an overnight layover in charlotte .
that 's just nasty !
the beds are very comfortable so you can get a good night 's sleep .
it was n't me .
others in our group had problems as well .
not convenient for an early flight .
this hotel is really dated , and the rooms smell funny .
the hotel itself is ok .
the bed was comfortable enough and the room was mostly clean .
oh yeah , the ac sounds like a _num_ taking off above your bed .
i 'm sure you can find better accommodations in this price range and location .
not delivering .
could n't do that !
im never going back .
no this was just gross .
service was terrible !
avoid at all costs !
the doctor confirmed her prescription was accurate and the glasses were off .
i made a change in frames less than _num_ hours from original order .
this store is terrible .
they were then _num_ hours late picking it up !
terrible .
terrible .
in the mean time my sales rep was fired apparently .
gag !
i miss the old garden ridge .
i called garden ridge to speak to a customer service rep .
gave me a texas number .
too much trouble .
im _num_ from ohio .
i shop alot , sometimes too much .
but you know what words i do n't mind hearing ?
`` apologies for the mistake .
i 've visited this store _num_ times .
only _num_ times .
first time nothing unusual happened .
i walked around .
i 'm not asking too much .
shes says , `` they 're not '' .
they know they 're going to get customers in regardless .
breakfast was good .
so disappointed .
am i still expected to keep waiting ?
these people are very difficult to do business with .
if they say yes , the bread is likely to be eaten .
if not , then go .
i dunno .
horrible .
should try ordering from the menu it might be better .
my husband let me try a bite of his rueben which was really good .
first off , the beer menu .
i was expecting something stellar , and i feel rather let down .
this stuff looked and tasted more like doughy noodles .
we ca n't believe it .
we can not , therefore , understand the rave reviews .
no thanks .
this has only been my 2nd time at a red lobster ever .
we were seated quickly for a friday night and the server was fine .
the service was horrible .
it seem to be over before it started .
terribly ran !
it does n't !
everything else is a joke .
i 'm not big on chain restaurants .
the clientele , for some reason , really made for a loud dining experience .
our waitress was hit or miss and we waited awhile for the bill .
would not visit again .
the waitress the first time i went was a little short , not personable .
plus my caesar salad had slimy wilted lettuce .
boxes and toys were all over the floor in the store .
the store needs a major overhaul and some employees who care .
terrible service .
are they going out of business ?
i made a very simple order online -- very difficult to screw up .
huge disappointment .
my bill : $ _num_ .
no complaints there .
not cool .
my advice is anyone picking up a to-go order is to do the same .
the restaurant was clean and the people working were friendly .
wo n't visit again .
he just put it on the bill .
worst customer service ever !
ashley furniture will get my business from now on .
she was super excited and counting down the days until arrival .
most places allow return of items within _num_ days , even if a mattress .
it was awful !
my god the sun will be coming up soon !
that was unacceptable .
the baby starts coming out : doctors runs in my room .
terrible treatment .
go here to die !
sorry wo n't be back !
no way , no how .
i called back at 10am instead .
next time your country ass needs to stay home from work .
stick to a boutique if you want real customer service .
bad idea .
lost sale opportunity .
another lost sale opportunity .
i open the bag where my dress was and i was so dissapointed .
they also rushed me during my final fitting .
brandy was the worst .
they lack skills .
$ _num_ ?
this whole department is insane .
glad this is all over .
it was just me and my mom and i just wanted to browse .
so that was weird .
what a horrible experience !
i also came in many times before and the employees never helped me .
they were just sitting down doing nothing .
i am definitely disappointed .
poor follow up .
the lunch portion was huge , too much in fact .
it was loud and crowded .
every time we have eaten here , we were hungry shortly after .
very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy .
it is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food .
she just seemed ... off ... or high .
confused !
holy ... cannoli ... get me out of here !
so disappointed !
you really seem to care about this restaurant 's reputation .
he said they 're making improvements and that i should try it again .
it was just okay as a whole .
for our main dish , we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni .
reason i book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time .
she gave me an attitude .
disappointment .
will never return to the restaurant .
disgusting !
worst italian food ever !
i was less than impressed .
its like the place tries too hard .
i made sure i asked for extra sauce ( just in case ) .
terrible !
what a disappointment !
avoid !
worst customer service .
staff very rude .
never had problem at other locations .
will not return at this location !
mama ricotta will be a better option .
strange odor - musty old smell .
very noisy .
_num_ .
birthday celebration & dessert is n't free ?
service was sub par at best .
the service was awful .
we were very disappointed .
the drinks and salads are also soooo pricey .
nothing special .
the visit i am reviewing was for take-out .
it appears this location has a serious management issue .
the only dish we liked was the chicken dish .
completely ruined our meal .
so this past friday i held a birthday dinner for my mother here .
ok italian food , portions are big , but you pay for them .
and the veal was dry .
not good customer service .
worst customer service ever !
after all it is taco bell .
you can usually count on them for cheap and fast food .
the cheap part is always standard .
but , the fast part for this location has struggled for a while .
after all it is taco bell .
what an ordeal !
or , they can pick-up the entire set and provide _num_ % credit .
the hostess was very short with me and my date .
no personality , still .
things have really slipped since then though .
they drowned my salad in ranch dressing and cheese ... .
my soup was alright - french onion - pretty standard .
no such luck .
the only employee i could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender !
it 's not a very good longhorn .
my hubby ordered coffee , cobb salad and filet .
no complaints .
it 's not .
then customer service wouldnt help me .
absolutely horrible customer service !
but they sure sold it to me .
horrible service .
horrible customer service .
ridiculous !
horrible is the word .
horrible business practice here .
do not shop at best buy .
there was a long line and only one employee at the checkout .
not going back again .
nothing !
i chose the fiesta chicken chopped salad and new chicken tortilla soup .
the service was horrible .
if you 're coming to eat ... ah you might think again !
i was disgusted .
yes i know sometimes things could land i 'm my food .
very visible and inappropriate .
the only bright spot was the waitress .
the food sucked .
just a mess .
total mess .
please do not use this location .
shortly after , another lady comes over .
the same style etc , just a different ring that fit .
anyways , horrible experience .
the place is just older and needs some renovations .
the deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share .
the spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth .
ended up with _num_ meals un eaten .
breadsticks and salad came out like expected .
the breadsticks are alway delish and hard to turn away eating more .
my server was horrific .
i am completely disappointed .
throughout the entire order , we got nothing but attitude .
but the rest of the place , not so much .
could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink ?
i know , i know -- olive garden , how pedestrian of me !
how disgusting .
this place was disgusting !
smells like wet dog .
delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking !
poor service .
service is very bad .
waitress was throwing plates on the table .
wow , only in charlotte would you find a chain restaurant bar crawl .
it saved me from cooking and doing dishes though .
but the reason i went was to try the lobster raviolis .
i just remembered why i do n't visit chain sit down restaurants .
i 'm glad there was more mango than strawberry .
the strawberry was too sweet .
a refill was never offered .
the salad was swimming in dressing where normally the dressing is light .
it was totally different from all other og restaurants i 've visited .
i had to walk around the whole restaurant to find my husband .
what a terrible manager !
for example , at my most recent visit i ordered the steak gorgonzola alfredo .
( that might also explain the meat being overdone ) .
very disappointing .
saturday was my first time back and i was dissapointed in the changes .
really made me sad .
the fries were bad .
first mistake .
_num_ .
i went and told carmax and they said ford was lying .
_num_ hour later it was completed .
i only stopped because i needed ta repair that day and they were close .
it is my pet peeve .
it is wrong .
i needed a patch so i could go on about my day .
i thanked the jerk for his time and drove off .
bad move buddy .
are you freaking kidding me ?
i am brand new to the area and never ordered from this location before .
who knows , maybe i was going to order a pizza anyway !
the pizza was cut all messed up as well .
send it my way , i 'll get you payment .
i made a reservation on monday to pick up some equipment on saturday .
they confirmed my reservation on the phone .
no big deal .
dew & when they brought it out , it was in a can .
gross .
ridiculous .
we normally delivery at work 2-3 or _num_ times a week .
the pricing is ridiculous .
this is not ihop quality food .
i was very uncomfortable .
from everyone , including bartenders , which is strange to say the least .
we 've been there twice and witnessed one fight per night .
dogs also get some time to run in a huge play area outside .
)
however , be sure to ask for a tour and see the space .
very disappointed !
quickly losing stars .
not a fan .
printed out my receipt .
she was having a hard time finding my order .
ummm no ?
this is a review of their business practices online .
slow , absolutely the worst .
hate the place !
beautiful courtyard less than _num_ yards away .
service is horrible .
you have been warned .
when we walked in , it was like we were in the south pacific .
it 's bad .
really bad .
otherwise , it stinks .
but this was nasty .
you 'll have a much nicer experience .
skip everything else !
not clean , either .
_num_ per person not worth it .
avoid this place .
did not like it .
not the cleanest establishment .
stealing from your customers is not a great idea china buffet .
not going for it .
was n't impressed .
very poor .
just not worth it .
poor job .
they damaged my car .
highly recommend you find another car wash .
poor customer service !
the only interior cleaning was vacuum .
it 's clear auto only cares about quantity not quality .
i 've taken my car here at least twice .
not our best ihop experience .
without them i 'd have gone hungry that night .
i ordered the country sausage potatoes , pumpkin pancakes & grits .
i 'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the french onion pot roast .
the soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt .
their orange juice is never too tart , never too sweet .
the mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning .
the omelet was uninspired .
it had no flavor whatsoever .
the red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them .
then the stack was topped with whipped cream .
terrible service and terrible food !
slow kitchen right .
in summary the service is very questionable .
i could n't agree more .
not really .
was n't impressed .
guess it was ok ?
otherwise it was _num_ miles .
they are not very through .
he said , `` just grab your registration and come on in . ''
no frills .
no fuss .
typical fast chinese food .
, but a couple places in charlotte made me like it again .
would n't recommend .
_num_ .

boneless ribs were n't typical .
not rib meat .

rice was over cooked .
complete mush .
there is no lobby .
Positive
they serve beer and wine !
really need to put some money into this place .
entire place smells like wet dog .
they have an assortment of beer and wine .
two different people in my office were reduced to tears .
there are many places less expensive or where you get more for your money .
i ask again , are they hot ?
she did n't massage anything .
i fianc gave me a gift card here for my birthday .
he did the total opposite .
she clearly saw us walk up , and my mother go into the shop .
i continued to stand there , and finally she ( lindsey ) greeted me .
over crowded , loud , and not a relaxing experience .
stayed at the hotel and booked two massages .
services between spas are typically the same .
the locker room was ridiculously crowded ( too small ) .
i 've been a yelp user for years .
i got rid of it myself , though lol .
common areas needed to be vacuumed !
_num_ stars might be too generous !
this place is awful .
this place is disgusting .
my room was not clean .
very disappointed .
they were gracious to direct us to signs that got us out of parking .
luckily , we had two $ _num_ dollar bills and it worked .
it was clear servicing customers was an inconvenience to him .
customer friendly said there is nothing he can do .
i had two dogs , fries , and a coke for lunch .
?
let 's start with having a _num_ sanitation rating .
ie skinny burgers with simple ingredients ( ie american cheese and ketchup ) .
no thanks .
walking through the halls it becomes evident this is an old hotel .
will not be staying here again .
really disappointing .
four star _num_ diamond yea right .
the steak was overcooked .
most of our bill was the wine .
bad food .
bug problem .
it was n't even spicy .
by now , my companions had finished eating .
nothing to write home about .
do n't understand the hype .
not a good dinner place .
this showmars used to be awesome .
also , the portions are not as big .
change management and has gone down hill .
missed opportunity .
gone was the flavor and little taste of spicy burn at the end .
major disappointment !
a shame .
and everything is ala carte !
no way .
but quality steaks can be eaten at much better priced establishments .
highly disappointed !
i would recommend capital grille over morton 's .
an hour .
_num_ ) write down orders so you do n't forget .
we do n't care !
service was awful .
i poured my own wine refills .
we ate our dinner quickly because of how hungry we were .
chili 's can cook a better steak than them .
ridiculous .
_num_ sides came out late .
i ordered the bone in fillet , they brought me a ribeye .
they made it anyway and gave it to me .
there is no excuse .
they did not have many items .
maybe this starbucks just want to sell all the coffee they made this morning .
not like you starbucks !
ok , mistake .
i really hate this place .
food was awful .
Negative
simply a bad experience .
at the same time she got sat another table of _num_ women .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the beer specials and _num_ .
we counted _num_ parties , thats it ... in a otherwise bare restaurant .
our drinks were refilled often without being asked .
will not be back .
went in to meet some friends who 'd come in from out of town .
my braised short ribs were all bones !
we will not be going back .
he needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made .
did n't get our food until after _num_ .
food is n't good either .
greasy and the batter was peeling off .
it had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it .
i called the manager over , to let them know the situation .
that is a lot for a less than adequate sandwhich .
i will not be coming back .
just average unfortunately .
the really really low point of the meal was the desert .
never going back .
not worth it .
know your customers , bring back the stew .
worst lunch option uptown .
i will not be returning .
my lunch companion had roast beef and regretted ordering anything .
bouncer was extremely rude .
we had a reservation for _num_ for a casual business dinner .
it was very difficult to get our server 's attention throughout the evening .
we walked in and waited to be sat .
i had carryout .
very quick but kinda confusing to find the place .
so far i have not found a good chinese food place here in charlotte .
still looking for a good chinese food place here in charlotte wish me luck !
it was a tofu , vegetables , and wide rice noodles entree .
they are rude .
literally rude .
i ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp .
i got the steamed chicken dumplings and a order of edamame to go .
if so , then you 'll want to take a pass on this place .
so sad .
used to be so much better .
no flavor .
wo n't be back .
i ca n't imagine how this place has _num_ stars .
egg roll was sour of all things .
very bland .
very very bland .
not much pineapple in the chicken pineapple dish .
i also ordered the curry chicken noodle bowl .
again , very bland .
not much of a coconut taste either .
the _num_ starts are just because the broccoli looks fresh .
this seemed quite bizarre .
food is terrible .
$ _num_ for two small hamburgers ?
i had the thai beef salad and it had about _num_ strips of beef .
as a vegetarian , it was entirely another matter for me .
what was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip .
horrible experience .
the bread was cold and hard .
went here a night during final four ( basket ball ) .
tried their philly cheese steak .
it 's horrible .
so , you get where this is going , right ?
room three does n't smell much better .
again , stale and moldy .
i like the quiche every morning rotating variety everyday .
not a good sign .
only _num_ stars for location .
but i strongly believe that the staff in their housekeeping department are not honest .
loud , loud , loud !
terrible for business travel .
no desk type chair .
rooms are poorly designed .
faux wood floor makes everything echo .
in fact faux wood furniture all around .
why in _num_ are hotels still doing this ?
the room are _num_ stars .
when we got back to our hotel .
_num_ caesar salad with flank steak and another caesar salad with shrimps !
stomach hurts all night .
i was seated and served a complimentary salad .
terrible customer service !
... no wonder .
we ordered hibachi steak chicken and shrimp with fried rice and vegetables .
was not impressed at all .
i used their online service to pick up my laundry .
but they are n't reliable .
breaking off buttons then charging to put back on .
i visited charlotte and decided to go here , cause it was crowded .
just dont expect anything amazing .
that might make it a little better .
the beer was decent , it 's just draft beer here .
ate here on a saturday night for a friend 's birthday .
also they were not that tender .
my wife had the chicken pesto pasta .
i mean , we went here thinking we would get a good value .
i have mixed feelings about rock bottom .
i will not be going back .
i also ordered the southwestern turkey burger .
the beer is awesome i will admit and the servers are pretty attentive .
really disappointed .
really , are they kidding serving store bought salsa ?
not sure we would return anytime soon .
Negative

chicken fried chicken for three of us and my wife had the sizzling peppers .
overall they get a d for food and an a for ambience and location .
ick !
so what was the point in an app ?
no lobster .
tried a variety of foods & none have been particularly good .
fianc ordered bison burger and ended up getting a 2am with egg , etc .
bun was also cold like just out of the refrigerator .
unacceptable .
not edible .
came in for a quick bite to eat on a sunday for lunch .
will not come back here .
the chicken breast was so small .
would recommend not sitting outside or at the bar if you want food .
stopped in before the panthers sunday night game .
gross .
unacceptable .
nothing that really stands out .
some drinks were returned from the bar while some never reached the table .
another couple ordered the cajun pasta and brewery beef tips .
no checks .
we paid for drinks and left our sever a gracious tip .
the veggies were overly salty table round .
after _num_ more min .
the broccoli was terrible .
the burgers were just okay .
the cheesy jalapeno dip it was served with was good .
the chicken tacos were good .
Negative
the service was awful .
it then took quite awhile for our dinners to start arriving .
this place was horrible !
do n't get married here .
fish was not fresh .
the manager claims he is very helpful ?
he is not !
the cashier was very polite , inviting , and helpful .
seems like they used imitation cheese , because it certainly didnt melt .
the place just seemed small and shabby to me .
we started off with two appetizers : calamari and crab dip .
wow , this was just embarrassing ( for them ) .
very bad .
[ the bad . ]
the temperature in the restaurant was hot .
_num_ outside , _num_ inside .
which is just weird in a restaurant setting .
my order was wrong .
so , let 's make that a _num_ stars .
restaurant dot com you 've let me down once again .
very poor service .
seafood noodle soup had slices of pork .
no ketchup ?
this could be an awesome place to stay .
i was given a sofa bed to sleep on .
i had made the reservation several weeks prior , with guaranteed late arrival .
his key does not work either .
the bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they also tend to forget some essential ( i.e .
i absolutely hate this place .
it was not my pillow .
the beds were uncomfortable .
_num_ coke = $ _num_ .
i will never be back .
no concierge .
the hilton would probably have been better or perhaps any of the other hotels .
i stayed three nights at the westin with a group for a conference .
two cups of coffee per room per day , extras can be purchased .
so why the low rating ?
i feel like i should only be spending maybe $ _num_ .
they just need a better starting product !
obviously management is not training well for customer service at this location .
description said grain mustard cole slaw and pickles .
the coleslaw was a couple pieces of lettuce with some carrots .
no apologies .
big box , impersonal hotel .
we stayed for four nights and got minimal cleaning service in our room .
i stayed here for a week .
i dunno .
avoid at all costs !
if anyone 's had theft problems , this may be why .
under renovations until december _num_ , _num_ .
the staff was friendly every time we walked past the front desk .
the restaurant across the street was apparently a night club as well .
we tried to nap but simply could n't .
it literally sounds like there is a major concert going on .
i stayed at this motel for _num_ nights ( june 19th & 20th ) .
i called & talked to manger as soon as i saw the bites .
when we checked out i spoke to manager & showed her my bites .
no more .
veterans beware !
do not stay st this hotel .
do n't expect too much .
the room doors are all spring loaded to they slam shut .
not a quiet hotel at anytime of the day .
sorry for the comment .
i signed up as they knocked at my door .
i was a customer for approx _num_ yrs .
would that have been so difficult ?
well money talks so they talked me into giving them another try .
horrible !
worst service ever !
i get it .
however , the sucker that i am for a deal , i got it .
she talked to the computer screen instead of to my face .
talk about unpleasant .
terrible customer service .
i read somewhere that charlotte has the highest time warner rates in the country .
once they have you they make it hard to escape .
when i finally get someone on the phone , they are rarely helpful .
since they apparently hire good people , hire more !
i do not like this company !
ca n't wait for more service providers .
are you kidding me time warner ?
let 's add up those dollars , shall we , time warner ?
therefore they installer never made it to my apartment .
but i placed the order online , then i am on hold again .
i 'm done i throw in the towel trying to deal with them .
wrong .
how can i help you today ? ''
`` ok , sir .
`` hello , sir .
bad idea .
horrible service !
so , i get online again , and guess what ?
horrible , horrible company .
worst service ever !
worse customer service ever .
before i talked to them , i could change channels and had a picture .
what a joke of a company .
so one month _num_ tech support calls later i got this information .
the first winter storm and the cable and internet is out .
stay away from time warner .
absolute thieves and liars .
do you ever leave a place and feel exhausted ?
well they delayed the change for _num_ weeks so they could collect more longer .
poor customer service .
terrible customer service .
literally , anywhere .
we 've been going through the same problems for years now .
just do n't do it !
_num_ up ?
worst company ever .
ca n't wait till google comes to save us .
wanting faster internet i signed up .
the worst everything .
Very negative
i honestly have no clue !
so i would say , sure - check them out .
just be sure to make your appointment with someone with experience .
first , they charge for beer and wine .
too big , almost .
so many fountains , open areas , gardens to visit .
look , stop being cheap .
lame .
this place is horrible .
not so much at uptown charlotte .
but for a few seconds , water completely stops .
she kept answering the phone even though others were there .
made a one night stay $ _num_ .
i can send it to marriott if requested . )
wo n't be returning .
my simple question was : do you price match to you own website ?
this review is for alterations only .
gross .
smoked salmon plus creamy sauce , yum .
maybe , to try the breakfast everyone seems to enjoy so much .
but probably not for dinner .
the first half dragged .
worse than cans .
is it worth the $ _num_ cover on fridays ?
not really .
i thought it was a bit too much .
this really is n't somewhere i want to be .
i 'm _num_ and i almost felt too old there .
but maybe that says more about me than it does bar charlotte .
$ _num_ for anything !
i just came from there .
i grabbed my daughter by the arm and led her out of there .
it 's not worth it .
i did n't touch anyone .
worst bar ever .
never going back .
i ordered smoked pork chops , home fries and green beans .
the fried chicken was straight forward .
it was a tad weird .
the collards were authentic and would get them again .
overall rating - just an ok .
_num_ to _num_ minutes .
i ordered fried chicken , greens , yams , catfish , and banana pudding .
not crispy looking , not seasoned .
not very tasty .
_num_ ) the catfish was a complete fish with bones .
_num_ ) banana pudding was very good !
to many restaurants want my patronage .
the only fast service was for the drinks and cornbread .
the food was alright and i thought that the portions were a good size .
i will not eat there again .
huge disappointment .
the collard greens were insanely salty .
instant high blood pressure for sale !
: ( i ordered the salmon cakes which were really hard .
fried chicken , macaroni and cheese and collards .
not impressed .
the okra and tomatoes were alright .
the service here sucks .
horrible !
not really impressed .
even the home fries where spicy .
i needed usually needed to wait and attempt to attract her attention .
the economy is not doing well.
horrible !
she never refilled our drinks either .
the fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them .
waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved .
service was cheerful though .
my biggest problem was the service .
fried chicken , chicken tenders , and salmon cakes were also okay .
try a waffle house and i think you 'll have a better dining experience .
servers had awesome personalities and were very hospitable .
however , the food ... .
sucked .
just did n't care for it .
seems like a tourist spot to me .
really disappointing .
this smell will stick to you for four to five hours at least .
that waitress says sure she 's the lady over there in the red shirt .
the collard greens had an excessive amount of uncooked onions and tomatoes .
not so !
what a disappointment !
but the real let down was my shrimp and grits .
no seasoning .
no flavor .
my husband and i went to mert 's on sunday morning around _num_ .
the service is terrible !
she indicated that a long wait to be acknowledged is not common practice .
she invited me back to the restaurant .
but it was cheap and the corn bread was excellent .
however while waiting two hours , we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner .
consider actually checking on the food .
pathetic .
over _num_ % of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention .
the server never apologized .
horrible customer service !
( not the waitress ) .
she was sarcastic & unprofessional .
horrible service !
the macaroni was good , they used cream cheese or something that tasted okay .
service was extremely slow .
the mac and cheese was good but again , it 's mac and cheese .
would n't go back .
the worst restaurant ever !
lazy and slow as ever !
we ended up with two other omelettes , the garden and the shrimp creole .
not the best soul good i 've ever eaten .
the fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about .
mac n cheese can pass for soul food .
Negative
tiger wood drinks were very tasty .
it was cold .
however , this was our experience .
not a fan of anything here .
i had such awesome memories of it and the food was to die for .
never once quality checked us .
im sorry .
this is n't the first time this happened .
overall i was very stuffed at the end of my meal .
apparently this is the place to go for some good ole greasy soul food .
the service was a _num_ .
i also got mac and cheese , bbq ribs , and green beans .
i had the beef ribs , collards , and mashed potatoes .
no bueno .
i got the fried chicken with greens and beans .
the chicken was crispy and to die for .
the greens were just succulent .
they were not that busy at all .
such a shame .
the mac and cheese and cornbread was all we ate .
i ordered chicken wings as an appetizer ... ummm that was definitely a given !
the macaroni and cheese ... well it was mostly cheese and not much macaroni .
staff was n't very friendly .
food was just ok , nothing special .
i ordered the salmon cakes with mac & cheese and yams .
my boyfriend ordered shrimp and grits .
i ordered the fried catfish plate with macaroni & cheese and collard greens .
i then ordered the fried chicken , collard greens and mac & cheese .
it 's ridiculous .
very bland .
my mom had a fried shrimp po ' boy with mac and cheese .
dessert we split a slice of german chocolate cake .
i recently visited mert 's for a brunch date and was so excited .
i ordered the french toast with the western omelette and home fries .
i ordered the fried catfish along with yams & mac n ' cheese .
so disappointed ... .
my fiance had ribs that were mostly fat and gristle .
this is n't it .
id give _num_ 1/2 stars .
no thanks .
not impressed .
what a waste !
i was sadly disappointed .
my colleague ordered the chicken fingers with mac and cheese and collard greens .
when our food arrived , my collard greens had tomatoes and onions .
the person i was with , asked the server for gravy .
as for the food .
salmon cakes were just ok .
i follow drive diner dives he raved about this place .
but you must pay to park .
ordered the chopped bbq , mac n cheese and yams .
food was not worth the wait .
will not go there again !
the macaroni and cheese was old and dry .
i am completely disappointed .
this place has an overall _num_ star review for a reason .
my salad was serviced in a tea cup plate .
my first ... ... .
!
the food was substandard at best .
i ordered beef ribs that were more fat than meat .
my boyfriend ordered the salmon creole with cabbage and a garden salad .
so my meal was the beef ribs with macaroni and cheese and cabbage .
but the beef ribs were okay and so were the side .
the menu was very very small .
walked in and the hostess was talking to someone she knew .
so we make our decisions .
we get the drinks and never see him again .
i asked for a glass of wine .
i sent it back and walked out .
both were awful .
next time , i 'll keep walking to johnny burritos .
kettle one with soda - everyone knows that 's soda water right ?
after 5+ years a friend that `` loves '' it talked me into it .
no value .
chopped red onion totally overpowered .
i even ate a couple and the sauces were yummy .
i made a reservation with mimosa for my family 's thanksgiving meal in _num_ .
secondly , the chef had sizzling salmon on the buffet .
wrong !
alot of better options uptown .
so , that gets a low mark in my book .
as for the brunch itself , it was very charlotte .
eggs , green beans , mac and cheese were all above par .
so , this looks like a three star review .
only a half step above a chain restaurant .
the hush puppies were spot on .
for dessert i had the apple pie cheesecake .
it was not edible .
i went here for sunday brunch trusting all the good yelp reviews .
the servers were not friendly .
went for queens feast tonight .
my stomach has n't been right since i ate it .
buffet only with a limited tapas menu .
overall poor service .
which were n't anything to write home about .
really _num_ 1/2 stars .
horrendous service and mediocre food .
atmosphere was a _num_ .
service was a _num_ .
a little seasoning ( salt , pepper ? )
no mushrooms .
i imagined smashed potatoes to be a bit more mashed .
.
we drove _num_ hr .
longhorn or any number of establishments are better at half the price .
i will not be returning .
first and last to this club .
very disappointed ... .
it 's $ _num_ ! ''
when you stop spending money they are off to another table .
worst place ever !
i get it , it 's a strip club ... but damn .
really low standards .
to me , it 's just your average , run of the mill pizza .
nothing special here .
when we called , she was informed that we did get the wings .
ordered at order here sign .
cashier asks me to repeat my order to him .
and now i realize why i only come here after a night of drinking .
disgusting .
anyway , the second time i came here was with my boyfriend .
the place is very cozy .
drinks are at least $ _num_ a pop .
the dinner ( some kind of fish ) was salty .
i found a long blond hair in my fish .
the waiter comp my meal out .
our waiter was not very attentive .
it was not impressive .
we will not go back .
and that is not a compliment .
we were so disappointed .
me `` okay ... i guess ? ''
this place only exists because of its prime downtown location .
parking was $ _num_ .
room service food was overpriced .
i will look for a more hospitable hotel next time i 'm in charlotte .
clean rooms .
one star .
there is no valet .
i walked to find dinner .
options were limited - subway and chinese food .
i would not stay here again .
grossly overpriced .
i will not be returning .
not by a long shot .
they have food , and they even have subs , but a deli ?
service was n't too hot .
but it was n't very good .
$ _num_ for a warm corona ?
not the place to be .
crowd was dull .
i was really excited to checkout brixx .
salad was somewhat wilted greens drenched in dressing .
)
ugh .
brixx is not the case !
he thought they would `` stay too long '' .
one word , ugh .
dirty floor , cardboard pizza .
few times i was incorrectly charged and impossible to get corrected .
i got precious few hours sleep that night !
i just know that it created a roaring sound in my room .
i just was n't impressed !
i showed him my coupon , and asked him if he accepted them .
Neutral
negative experience # _num_ :
my girlfriend walked here to get change for laundry .
the steak is average and it 's over run by boa middle management .
go for the top tier steak ... steer clear of apps .
my husband likes steak , but -- - i want to eat healthy .
ugh .
sadly it was not .
eating in the best restaurants in town and when we travel is not unusual .
the calamari and the mozzarella wrapped cheese .
my wife had the salmon which was better than the filet but nothing exciting .
the creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake for desert were both amazing .
i would recommend just hitting the bar for these late night after a show .
this place is terrible .
for starters i got the mozzarella basil tomato salad .
i made reservations for nye probably around _num_ weeks in advance .
i should 've known better .
i also ordered a jerk chicken sandwich .
cold cold cold .
it was just meh .
chicken was a bit dry .
the worst food ever .
but beyond that , total meh .
generic , but what else do you expect from most downtown businesses .
this is what knocked the 3rd star off .
get your shit together .
nothing happens .
so now i am out $ _num_ and never got a paper .
the paper got thinner and thinner for a city the size of charlotte .
so why does my bill say different .
it is expensive .
he was diligent and never had a problem for _num_ years .
signed up to have daily paper and never received _num_ paper .
these people are unbelievable !
ugh worst serves ever !
besides , one can google any recipe online for free .
update !
major fail !
second best my margarita ( s ) that our server made was awesome !
gross !
disappointed is an understatement .
i will not be back .
the worst service ever .
the food is disgusting .
avoid at all costs .
do n't bother going .
so i left .
horrible business model .
thanks but no thanks .
they only allow certain tiny bags in or clear plastic bags .
the food was not good however .
$ _num_ car bomb shots !
trash .
upstairs and outside areas are tight too .
immediately walking in you are struck by a smell .
lots of tables and benches or chairs .
they even had corn hole .
and the jersey - boy bartenders have major attitude .
i felt really unwelcome the entire time i was in the store .
called this morning to check about the watch .
my wife ordered a chicken salad on pita , minus lettuce and tomatoes .
avoid at all costs .
minus _num_ star for that .
well , not so much .
very slow .
i would hire any number of them at any time .
the service is lousy .
horrible .
same sandwhich never costs the same price .
terrible service .
i do n't need this , seriously .
will not go back .
so if you are looking for atmosphere , not your place .
he had never been and what better way to try out a new restaurant .
i had the stuffed shrimp , he had the almond crusted tilapia .
the tilapia was a complete opposite !
no salt at all !
so unfortunate .
my tuna was cold and was not cooked well .
steak was over cooked .
atmosphere was casual but prices were upscale .
and just walked off .
every single bite was perfection !
there are load of other upscale establishments in charlotte that get it done .
the experience was nothing close to nice or upscale .
kevin had lobster pasta and i had steak .
aside from that , the desserts were good .
just nothing to write home about .
i asked for a mount and balance from them and had a good laugh .
they did the same service for $ _num_ .
a few simple items turned into a large bill .
i thought the charges were excessive and questionable services that they stated i needed .
not again for me .
they scratched my car .
typical auto repair shop trying to steal money especially from young women .
greyhound is a nightmare !
as bus stations go this one is pretty neat , tidy and clean .
is n't that your job ?
but , they act as though i 've asked for the world .
this place is horrible .
it was a nightmare .
somehow still managed to spend _num_ bucks a head .
on the outside , it looks like a corner business .
would i go here again ?
it was terrible .
not impressed .
not enough staff .
i will not go back .
she added _num_ % gratuity , which was when we asked for a manager .
i will not be back .
also , do n't leave fast food on a table in the dining area .
it 's not sanitary .
prime rib sub that was a mass of gristle and fat .
cucumbers that had seen much better days before they wound up on my sandwich .
the second time , we visited in the afternoon for lunch .
very slow internet .
as for the accommodations themselves , it is your typical hampton , nothing fancy .
dirty and nasty .
this is the place for wan na be steelers fans .
not sure about this place .
it never seems that clean .
ridiculous !
but not in a good way .
do not live here .
completely unacceptable .
we had carpet , and the oldest , white appliances i have ever seen .
not only am i a professional , but i work two jobs .
i 'm in bed before 8pm on most nights .
also very over priced .
very poor customer service .
you should just go to fedex where they gladly accept your patronage .
in addition , it seems a little pricey for what they offer .
disgusting , slow and pathetic .
there luckily was a subway up the street .
i would not recommend this cleaner .
clothes were n't pressed correctly & they 're expensive .
it 's a convenience store , like walgreens or cvs .
the room was not very nice .
musty smelling .
however , staff was nice and accommodating .
probably not .
i would hate it , but she likes a firm mattress .
_num_ .
hallways and rooms were dim , though the beds were comfortable .

i would hate to see what a normal room looks like .
poor design .
lots of other hotel choices in the area .
the ritz ... and then what ?
everything was more or less ok except for the noise .
you should sue the pants off the entertainment district for the late night noise .
gross !
we only stayed one night .
-the room was just dingy .
walked in and smelled the musty smell that other yelpers described .
there is limited items for those looking for a healthy diet .
this was my first trip to charlotte .
it continued for two hours .
sure , i wrote that down and remembered it _num_ months later .
complete disappointment !
completely disappointed .
this ruined my anniversary !
the makeup mirror was hanging off the wall ready to fall .
smallest bathroom ever for a hotel i 've stayed in .
so gross .
i vote anywhere else .
_num_ .
_num_ .
if you are lucky turn down service will happen .
_num_ .
everything else screamed _num_ .
actually all of the staff i encountered in my _num_ days here were great .
wo n't be back .

they suggested i move rooms but none would be quiet ?
no thanks .
this was my 9th time in charlotte for business .
wifi costs _num_ bucks a night .
valet another _num_ .
this place is closed _num_ years ago .
contact lenses over-priced .
reviewers , we will be looking for another provider for these services .
terrible service and experience !
but today , i think i have had enough with this place .
nothing has changed .
get them in , get them out .
shame on me .
shame on me .
blood pressure reading was input in my chart before taking my blood pressure .
mistakes happen , i get it , but three strikes and your out .
the pair never was ordered .
when it was addressed , maria stated she will order again .
i called over the waiter and explained .
avoid this restaurant !
guess that 's worth _num_ stars eh ?
will not be going there again .
it is simply a greek restaurant called french quarter .
everything else ... so-so .
very busy with short wait times .
very loud too .
difficult to hold conversations .
seating too close together .
soup was mediocre .
i 'm totally confused .
terrible selection , rude !
my family ordered the bacon burger , chicken fingers , and a greek wrap .
no real kids menu .
the food was very tasty , waitress was very cordial .
let me just get your drink orders . ''
i ordered seared ahi tuna salad .
even so , the service was adequate - nothing more , nothing less .
sides are ordered separately ; we selected grilled asparagus and potato gratin .
the portions are quite generous but the presentation was way off for me .
the little copper pot it came in was cool though .
mashed potatoes was my only choice .
for $ _num_ , they ca n't find i potato ?
the steak was served on top of the overly buttered mash potatoes .
as the website states , with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes .
false advertisement .
do n't stay here .
it 's like they are trying to make the ghetto look classy .
the shuttle driver claimed he was never told about a _num_ pickup .
do not stay here .
worst hotel !
this is a standard gas station and not really worth reviewing .

our waiter was awful .
had to track down another server twice for drink refills and our check .
rude employees .
it also felt like i was eating a bowl of lard .
service was extremely slow .
hit and miss for lunch and summer .
i stop her from running off because the food looks suspicious .
free bread : none .
free bread : none .
never use this place .
do not recommend .
hard to believe how they stay in business .
now , almost two weeks later , my order still has not arrived .
these books were needed last friday for a class that meets on mondays .
this is unacceptable .
would n't go back .
but then he asks if he can see the earrings and necklace .
i 've worked in the jewelry business , and i know what i like .
i was very clear in the preferences i stated .
you do n't tell a customer what to like .
that 's unacceptable .
anyway , we were dropping off three rings .
horrible customer service .
how rude !
not a way to gain a new customer !
my wife then confirmed her day off from work .
when two weeks go by , i called to check in .
probably the least professional business i 've ever worked with .
claimed his repair guy was out of cell range all day .
very rude and unprofessional guy !
my home warranty company gave me the number to carolina appliance service .

it seemed a little rough .
the nurse was very short with me .

never fear , she sold us a ticket .
it 's terrible .

nasty !
as for their food options , they 're not great .
Neutral
the snack was another problem .

managers of the park know this and they dont do a thing about it .
im done w this place .
staff is n't polite or even nice for that matter .
park is n't very clean .

they did have a free petting zoo and horse ride was eight dollars .
the guy ( tom ) , acknowledged everything i was saying .
so i dropped it off for a week .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
ridiculously overpriced for the finished product and experience .
no call .
not ready .
entire car was dusty , inside and out .
the room smelled awful .
i was on a long trip from florida and stopped here for the night .
i have never been to a less taken care of establishment .
they have a sanitation rating of _num_ % .
not nearly impossible , literally impossible .
nasty hotel !
i could not believe it .
i had to flush like _num_ times for it to clear the bowl .
the water was very hard .
it got cold at night .
no customer service .
when i went in to discuss , i heard another patient checking in .
the doctor prescribed me medication that i am allergic to .
they are lazy ass hell !
horrible .
extremely poor customer service .
and we went over by _num_ cent !
drab drab drab .
are you kidding me ?
pay less has better !
sometimes i guess expected good customer service is asking for too much .
this is just ridiculous .
crime is a problem !
oops , all the treadmills are occupied .
to be fair , we knew it was pricey .
same with my ginger ale .
slow , slow , slow .
however , based on previous reviews , the food is hit or miss .
my dinner there was a substantial miss for a pretty substantial price .
or if someone else is picking up the tab .
or you can fall in love and find reason to be back daily .
the cake di chocolate is standard lava cake ( takes forever to make ) .
not a fan .
i am in boston , not charlotte .
ok , i 'm lying .
wrong !
so nobody went home with their own food .
sounds fancy , eh ?
manager : ( blank stare and walks away ) .
we were excited to dine at blue as part of restaurant week .
um , probably not .
i never tasted such an overwhelming orange dish in my life .
nothing to write home about .
the duck was really rough & fatty .
i preferred them over the duck .
for dessert , we ordered the cheesecake to split .
the food was decent .
service was absolutely horrible !
it was very bizarre !
not impressed .
would n't go back .
all _num_ over prices and all _num_ just okay .
and still disappointed .
pop and they were down the hatch !
_num_ star .
_num_ stars .
something tells me there is better seafood out there in charlotte .
my first visit to blue a few years ago was fabulous .
probably would not go back .
do not recommend .
to be honest with you nothing really jumped off the menu to me .
i settled for the beef tenderloin and fried calamari appetizer .
went for a girls night for restaurant week .
the cookie was terrible !
it was gross .
it all seemed to disappear , though , so that says something !
maybe a warning sign .
it was also very loud .
our waters were n't refilled but once .
i waffle between _num_ stars and _num_ .
here i am on yelp looking at queen 's feast and i see blue .
here i am on yelp looking at queen 's feast and i see blue .
the fruit was mediocre .
the salad was n't good .
there were very few vegetables to order with it .
it 's a shame .
my husband ordered a whiskey sour and our friends and i ordered bloody marys .
eventually i just gave up .
mediocre food .
pretentious and overpriced .
i 'm just going to break this down into pros vs cons .
three half pours of wine for like $ _num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ orders of this .
_num_ .

all in all , i promise you can find a better restaurant in charlotte .
there are better restaurants to frequent .
owner was extremely polite .
waitress was not the best .
when they do deliver , it always takes longer than the estimated time .
it was bland !
it 's just not good .
the website clearly stated the restaurant closed at 10pm .
all in all , it was def not my best groupon date night .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
the noodles were not good either .
bad move .
i did n't like it .
earlier this week i decided to order a rather large order to be delivered .
felt rushed even though other tables were available .
horrible college .
i would try something else ... if i go back .
you get a lot of food but its kind of expensive for lunch .
will not go back .
very dirty and disgusting .
got up and walked out .
we ordered the szechuan shrimp and scallops and also the shrimp in garlic sauce .
gross .
but i 'm not going to anymore .
never ordering from this place again .
first of all , the customer service was great !
our total bill was almost $ _num_ .
i would recommend others to check the price when you drop off your clothes .
_num_ minutes !
monday you did n't have meat .
_num_ dollars ?
there is no tomorrow .
i will not go back !
maybe my standards are too high .
i had a chicken biscuit , and the boyfriend had egg and bacon .
disappointed .
but it just fails to deliver too often .
to be honest , that sealed the deal for me .
once again , the nurse 's attitude was inexcusable .
long review , but i felt strongly enough that i wanted to post .
no bed side manor .
horrible experience and expensive .
if they had not i would have left .
the pizza , the calamari , the pasta .
my husband and i ate here this evening .
we were seated promptly without a reservation and the waiter quickly took our order .
that , like i said , i give up .
they kept the beer and wine flowing at our table at every visit .
i was underwhelmed but my coworkers raved about their dishes .
with grilled veggies and mashed potatoes .
leftovers are in my future .
goat cheese - this was without a doubt my favorite of anything all night .
y'all clearly have never eaten outside of charlotte .
)
rude !
when i say frequent , i mean every friday .
i have been to italy and this food is nowhere near `` authentic . ''
totally not worth it .
we used to really like their lasagna and pizza .
maybe i 'm weird .
but it seems like recently , everything at mama 's is over seasoned .
mediocre italian food .
the food here was just adequate .
the waiter said they get really busy so they bring the check first .
but does n't nutella tastes like peanut butter to you ?
the last few times out experience was just fair .
no taste .
i ordered the cheese ravioli and added two meatballs .
i was very disappointed !
it was much better than the spicy pasta .
in buffalo , we like a little pasta with our sauce .
took money out of my account for late fees .
never notified me , never called nothing .
horrible customer service .
ca n't wait to go back !
suggestions , maybe do a little housekeeping .
will not return ever .
i used to frequent v cleaners & alterations .
_num_ dress shirt .
so from that day forward , i started to patronize them less .
i started referring other people here but i will stop the referrals immediately .
i will find a more customer oriented business that appreciates customers .
very condescending people .
charged for _num_ and only did _num_ .
i had an emergency on the morning i was leaving for europe .
really bad service .
( this was a different , older man btw ) .
recently i placed a take out order .
hmmm , he charged me only $ _num_ .
i bought tickets online _num_ days prior to the show .
if it was made so clear ... why were we having this discussion ?
i was n't impressed at all .
too cramped .
could n't get to the bar .
no service once there .
i took a _num_ lb package to ups and asked for a quote .
first of all , the food came very quickly , which is rare .
the salad was just so-so .
i travel to clt fairly regular on business .
if you really want great indian food ... go to copper .
it 's all about curries , rice , naan and spices .
time to find a better indian place , i 'm afraid .
absolutely no taste .
did my irish name cause my order to be overly americanized ?
terrible service !
avoid !
the wait staff had to be reminded several times of what we ordered .
very disappointed .
ordered to go and gave clear instructions to have two separate meals .
the employees spoke very little english and that was a huge barrier .
the spice was horrible .
someone needs to wake up , update , and start cooking with passion .
life is too short .
very very disappointed .
wo n't be back .
so bad !
the standard is appalling .
it did not taste authentic .
very disappointed .
it says a lot when your patrons are non indian .
i was quite disappointed .
i was a customer , and my car got towed .
- just iceberg lettuce and cucumber !
it did n't taste like anything !
my boyfriend and i have been coming to this place for a long time .
disgusting !
the veggies were the only high spot .
they dont go over the math which is a big part of the test .
excuse me ?
it was clear all she cared about was bringing me to the cleaners .
the food was to die for and the service was perfection .
nonetheless , filing taxes is a necessary evil .
just basic chinese food .
: ( i 'll buy online before i go in here again .
not here .
not steamed or toasted and not soft .
as i walked away , i looked at my phone .
i was turned away , despite the obviously urgent situation .
first and last time i will be going to jones dry cleaning .
do yourself a favor and go to quail dry cleaners next door .
terrible !
go to domino 's if this is your papa johns for your area .
inefficient and lazy .
the bald manager is not a very nice person also .
tipping should be up to the customer , not the cashier !
we also got the standard egg rolls and crab rangoon .
i mean , c'mon , it 's veggie lo mein !
overly sweet and not so appetizing .
good chinese takeout here , seems to be hard to find .
i was very disappointed .
the coupon was spend _num_ , get _num_ off .
in any case , i was a little let down .
i 've had worse .
on second though i think my cafeteria was better .
seriously , do n't go here .
i even asked for low salt , low sugar , and low msg .
con : they reheated the same food they 'd made earlier for me .
they were essentially fried wontons , not crab rangoon .
food was _num_ mins late .
mongolian beef was filled with all onions ( for filler ) .
delivery has gone downhill .
canned soda no refills .
would not recommend .
it has gone downhill .
it 's the only place i order my chinese takeout from .
very bland .
crystal clear and the music sounded like a million bucks coming out of it .
)
anyway , we had to purchase more tickets at the door .
guess the best advice , just pay at door .
they 're out of bacon , yes bacon !
my husband and i stayed here as a weekend get away to charlotte .
but my praise begins and ends there .
terrible ) .
_num_ years of loyalty mean nothing if you are laid off .
crab rangoon was terrible .
also ordered beef & mixed vegetable , meh .
horrible service .
do not go to this one .
what type of pizza could possibly take over two hours ?
wrong pizza was delivered .
very rude .
my entree , the scallops served with risotto , was fine but overpriced .
seriously , the youngest person there was in their early _num_ 's .
avoid at all costs !
we tried it again tonight for our anniversary dinner .
big mistake .
not worth the money .
very cold .
annoying .
so cold .
when we walked in the restaurant decor seems dated , or perhaps just generic .
we split the chopped salad with gorgonzola .
while everything was decent , nothing really came together .
skip this one .
interesting old house feel to the place .
this is not authentic cajun food !
this has got to be the most overrated restaurant in charlotte .
fortunately it was only half price because of the groupon that i used .
maybe it 's because people have never had real cajun cuisine before .
my entree was the combo etouffee with shrimp , chicken and crawfish .
the seasoning was weak .
the portions were good .
i will not be going back .
but not a good group night .
thank god i only went bc i had a groupon .
this was our first visit to this restaurant .
my fiance and i went to cajun queen one night as a date night .
needless , to say not a great experience .
it was not good .
visiting charlotte from los angeles while husband is in town for business .
not the shrimp , the sauce with bread dipped in .
so incredibly let down by this dining experience .
( i got the crawfish creole and my girlfriend had the chicken etouffee . )
the owner could care less about customers .
nothing cajun about it .
still , not the big easy .
_num_ - new orleans .
very dissatisfied and disappointed .
will not go back .
this time , gave another shot and tried oysters and shrimp .
there were romaine core in the salad and one slice of cucumber .
trying cajun yard dog next .
if that 's a bust , so much for cajun in charlotte .
a friendly restaurant employee is the exception to the rule at cajun queen .
very bad service .
we were next to the kitchen and it was really loud .
my husband got the chicken shrimp diane .
i 've never had pecan pie like this texture before .
this place is awful !
the reservation was for _num_ and _num_ of us got there first .
i was so mad .
i did n't eat it .
fried green tomatoes were good .
bbq shrimp were fine .
i 'll never return again .
reservations at 5:30 on a saturday and it was packed .
it was just embarrassing to new orleans .
parking sucks .
downstairs tables are too close .
not a fan .
me and my spouse order the same thing every time .
leadership in these places however are what make your business .
then change how you handle your customers .
i stopped by the chicken box to grab lunch today .
does anyone know where the old managers went ?
very disappointed .
_num_ minutes .
my mother , daughter and i went here last week .
wow , how rude !
oh and you have to put _num_ % upfront .
i 've never been treated like this .
too expensive .
but it was a mixed rack ... .
mac & cheese : so , so .
two words ... ... keep driving !
i 'm dissatisfied !
this place is disgusting !
worst pilot ever !
food came correctly and my iced coffee was bomb !
oh well , ca n't win them all i suppose .
you just get in your car and drive .
i just did n't feel welcomed .
hopefully i get a better experience next time .
we went to have a snack and wait til the next round .
on a positive note , saturday is half off on ladies night .
terrible customer service .
first of all , it is in a sketchy part of charlotte .
small station .
`` could be _num_ .
i repeat , this is a station review !
that 's a problem for another review .
and it is ugly .
terrible train .
staff are totally rude .
no southern hospitality whatsoever .
if you take a train out of here , have someone drop you off .
not very professional .
so , two weeks roll around and we head out to noda .
she asks my husband to reschedule .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
for my third tattoo , i decided i wanted to go to fu 's .
none to be had here !
crappy hair dryer .
holes burned in comforter .
stayed one night in _num_ bedroom unit .
he slept on the sofa both nights .
cold burger .
rude people overall .
horrible place .
that 's sad .
no stars .
wrong !
anywhere remotely healthy or yummy looking had an insane line .
the us air passenger service agents are complete jerks .
one of my least favorite airports .
check in with the airline was smooth , thats about it .
i could n't help myself .
no preferred line .
clt needs improvements in the drop off and pick up areas .
she made them all get back out of lines and walk to the end .
charlotte ... could suck less but there are some things they are doing ok .
some of the walkways seem narrow but that could be just me .
hate security here .
this airport has ridiculously long lines .
there are many dining and drinking options , and cool rocking chairs .
when i got through , i had to go through security again .
security checks are here to stay , do something about it .
i ended up driving back to the hertz lot and dropping off my car .
the rental buses are relatively quick but the guy that was driving -- suck !
i 've only been traveling all of my life .
i get through security and notice the tight space of this terminal .
at other airports , the gates are in close proximity .
for some reason i always have to connect between terminal e and terminal a .
i like lax as my favorite airport .
it restaurants are over prices for a state that ends in carolina .
and the seats are certainly not designed for sleeping .
we officially hate charlotte .
so it has made us assume that everyone in charlotte must be as well .
the food options are spread out , expensive , and impersonal .
this airport is not the best .
worst airport ever .
it is not near the top of my favorites .
horrible .
worst us airport ever !
my final piece of advice , wear comfortable shoes and stay alert .
hate you .
what the hell ?
she can walk , but not fast , and not far .
the location , however , is stellar .
avoid at all costs .
i flew through here two times last week .
not a fan at all .
security lines are ridiculous .
_num_ .
crowded with narrow walkways .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
with the gates built so far apart and narrow walkways .
ridiculous !
i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here .
you lose three stars for these things .
poor food quality .
poor planning .
poor traffic flow .
poor crowd control .
this airport is _num_ years behind other airports of similar size and volume .
you could probably walk it by then , twice .
terrible service !
very rude !
there is n't .
been in three airports on our trip to north carolina .
in the meantime your connecting flight can be boarding .
_num_ 1/2 star rating ?
)
all your outlets ... lol .
if you 're comparing it to any other modern airport it is substandard .
i am not a fan .
this airport is not family friendly .
this is so frustrating !
avoid this airport .
any review that says this place is great seriously has not been anywhere .
that gets annoying .
seating is far less plentiful than it should be .
`` some time are a little slower than others . ''
get your act together .
i 've not spotted a tram if there is one here .
that was a first time that i 've noticed rocking chairs in an airport .
flew through here going to paris .
full of rotten people .
ugly nasty concourse e .
it 's out of date and feels like _num_ .
it 's pretty gross .
that 's saying something considering i travel _num_ % of the year .
tsa here is horrible .
not a fan of this airport .
i 'm glad i had to run through between flights .
however , arriving in clt is another story .
man , i hate this airport .
internet is very cheap and should be provided accordingly .
it is no longer .
worst airport experience .
oh wait this is charlotte nc , never mind .
some of us would actually like to get home to our families .
ridiculous .
never connecting through charlotte again .
i stopped at the local stores the whole time i 'm in nc .
ridiculous .
do n't be fooled .
very crowded , not a problem .
always so busy coming through here .
only redeeming thing was bojangles .
the workers however suck balls .
confusing terminal approach and rental car return area .
it 's annoying .
waste of time .
then i go to the bathroom and there are attendants looking for tips ?
a small airport that needs some improvement .
the lines for security here are long .
not here .
wendy 's is one of the slim choices for food .
no interesting shops .
i 'm not a big fan of this airport .
customer service : disappointing .
it was torture .
restaurants : disappointing .
other than that , it 's just a bunch of chains .
Neutral
unfortunate .
really unfortunate .
unacceptable .
overly crowded .
often see people sitting on the floor at some gates .
it is _num_ pm and the line is past the american check in counters .
i 'm a young african american woman on my way back to chicago .
every restaurant closed at 10pm on a friday night .
only thing open is starbucks .
ca n't stay in terminal .
and while you 're waiting , tsa agents stand around chatting .
but this was going on long before i arrived at 5pm .
i wish she would help everyone that ever needs help while traveling .
okay no big deal .
he said all these drivers in charlotte suck at driving .
the last time i was here i was rushing between flights .
nah , just sit there and wait .
clt is one of american airlines hub and it 's extremely crowded .
no thanks clt .
worst airport for baggage .
the worst tsa experience !
they really need a customer service training .
avoid this airport !
get rid of the mens room bathroom attendants !
that is where our connecting flight 's gate was located .
i 'm used to airports in cali where every seat has a charger .
and i 've been to quite a few of those .
it 's a museum , not a zoo after all .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i get the sandwich , there are two tomatoes on there .
horrible restaurant .
it 's a pig bucket of bk .
you might get better service at the chilis too in the same airport .
and her response was gold .
she said that they consider all the patty to be meat .
side order of buffalo chicken strips .
the item should be called buffalo soup with chicken strips .
it 's probably a better level of ordinary .
they made me wait a long time and gave me a platter with sausage .
please do not eat there .
Positive
this one is terrible .
the fries were good and the burger was as i ordered .
shit hole !
the combination kills it for you .
i had the spaghetti with italian sausage .
the sausage was piled on top the meat sauce in ground pile .
poor , poor presentation .
it was around $ _num_ .
food was only ok , but good portions for the price .
it was ridiculous .
the lasagna and spaghetti is very generic .
the pizza was horrible !
not much more than a chunk of lettuce drenched in italian dressing .
chef ramsey , where are you when we need you ?
our food came out relatively quick , which was a plus for lunch service .
this is your standard , old-school red sauce italian restaurant .
not even cooked !
disgusting .
the owners should be ashamed .
greek salad was pretty good but nothing else really was .
service fast but not friendly .
all i can say is yuk .
the salad is a simple bowl of iceberg lettuce .
my one must get here is the cheesy garlic bread .
they even have original menus as part of the decor .
they still use an antique register at the front check out counter .
but if you 're in the neighborhood , stop by for a meal .
this place looks like it was frozen in _num_ .
this is not italian .
we could n't finish our meal .
sanitation rating _num_ ?
this was n't it .
for the entree , i had the eggplant parmigiana .
i ate as much of the eggplant and meat as i could dig out .
the `` meat '' in my dish was some greasy lips and assholes .
you are killing me !
i had a small side salad to start which the waiter described as greek .
just bad .
food was horrible .
my daughter ordered a pizza that was a warmed up frozen pizza .
the food was horrible !
she assured me that it was cooked earlier today and reheated when ordered .
i will not be back .
the food is horrible .
i went to dinner with _num_ friends and we had a variety of food .
the bread was store brought italian bread from the grocery store .
the salad is bag salad from a grocery store with dressing on it .
i kindly sent it back .
it is overpriced and not worth it .
wow .
bank of america at it again with less than exceptional customer service .
will not recommend .
taste like noodles , salt , and water .
not made with love .
everytime we attempt to come here they are closed .
worst service .
customers are rude too .
our server just walked out .
like , just walked out .
then , turns around and walks off .
no explanation .
all we ordered was a pasta , breadsticks and desert .
terrible .
no pizza , no call .
i get there and the place is chaotic .
very disappointing !
pitiful !
service sucked !
almost _num_ hours to get a pizza delivered .
terrible customer service .
i got a flounder dinner there recently , asked for some extra tartar sauce .
not a big fan of this place .
very slow service !
bread , cheese , meat - that 's it .
they 're cheap in the fries .
Neutral
i 'll leave the odor to your imagination .
side note ... .
ppl w/ guns kill ppl .
i was looking to trade and was offered _num_ % of what i paid .
not much , even in the used section .
use the internet or drive over to matthews and go to fire power .
the background check is only required for long guns .
the last person i 'll point out is , i think , larry .
just looking at , and holding to see if you like how it feels .
i 've never been overly impressed with hyatt .
avoid this place .
made a reservation thru priceline on the parking shuttle and got there around 1am .
but the room was smelly and dusty .
she booked us here on the way to ohio .
do not stay here .
_num_ march 1st this is the date i went .
so overall , not good .
really , it was a fine place to stay for the ridiculously low rate .
definitely not staying there again .
but we drove a long way and needed a place to stay in charlotte .
i would not recommend staying !
got the chicken parm sub as recommended by yelpers .
mine was a little dry but a decent sandwich .
menu includes hot sandwiches , wraps , gyros , and salads .
chicken was pretty good though .
i ordered a western omelette that was just completely destroyed by imitation cheese .
this is why i chose them to begin with as stated about .
i really thought they were much better than this .

before i go on the owners and staff are all pretty awesome .
no complaints there .
and points off for cutting out indoor smoking .
as a matter of fact it was all over the place .
the bed was comfortable and the room was mostly quiet .
ive stayed here about _num_ times over the past 4-5 years .
it was a smoking room - and i do n't smoke .
you 've been warned .
this place is disgusting .
two bugs greeted me as i entered my room .
no bugs yet .
we stayed here one night .
it was disgusting and filthy .
my picture sums up staying at this particular micro inn .
this is the linens i am gon na go with . ''
horrible stay .
smelled like urine .
totally gross .
it just looks trashy .
not entirely sure what that 's about .
poor location and service .
terrible !
as for quality , my chicken was piping hot just out of the fryer .
would n't recommend .
our group mostly ordered the prime rib and two had the blackened chicken pasta .
why not serve chocolate cake , cookies , mousse ?
the show was bad .
from the moment you walk in they make you feel like your home .
white rice was rice was fine .
i 'm sure i will be back as my coworkers visit this place frequently .
so something weird to begin our visit ... .
i have never experienced that in any restaurant before .
first time , last time .
the chicken was chewy and dry .
the biscuit was even small and dense .
they were not even that busy .
seems management does n't care either ... .
the bun was firm like it was quite old .
the sandwich looks like someone sat on it .
i was wrong .
although i 'm not a burger person , theirs was pretty tasty .
con : they only accept cash .
the bill was $ _num_ .
what did he want _num_ % ?
my visit was on a saturday between noon and _num_ pm .
odd , but probably the most efficient .
the slaw was also minced rather than being shredded .
all hype .
he does not know everything .
dude - here 's a tip - do n't ask for a tip .
everyone else in my party said the same thing .
here 's a tip , do n't ask for a tip .
baked beans were from the can .
my boyfriend seemed to like the chicken so i tried a small piece .
, but i let him come and do at least the outside work .
i guess it was cheap .
however , this place does have burgers and other menu items .
no thanks .
rounded down to the next star for this _num_ star review .
the sitting area was a nice size and the kitchenette area was clean .
no problem right ?
not returning anytime soon .
stayed october _num_
we accepted the room , thanked her and went to our room .
the housekeeping was n't any better .
it included a dish washer and a microwave , small fridge .
no spa area .
fitness room only includes cardio .
it is very isolated with not much within walking distance .
will was our driver .
rude front desk staff .
will not go back .
terrible .
billing sucks .
my appointment was at _num_ .
they scheduled me an appointment with a specialist two weeks out .
i took my prescription to another vendor and had my glasses made .
i could not see anything .
not `` how can we make it better for you ? ''
slow unfriendly service .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
nasty !
this is a five star mcdonalds so to speak .
her fries are cold as are the nuggets .
rude rude rude .
mcdonald 's is mcdonald 's there 's nothing really special to say .
quick cheap food with a tolerable customer service .
so , i decided to go with _num_ hotcakes .
i found a property online that i fell in love with .
rude and unprofessional !
for the inside dining experience , mcdonald 's beats burger king , hands down .
however , the food is definitely meh .
breakfast gets a _num_ , dinner gets a _num_ .
horrible !
so she got me the street side tacos for me to munch on .
but i suspect the rest of the food are blah too .
the same owner 's mimosa grill in uptown charlotte is much better .
really not much to say .
also $ _num_ beers of which i 've had about _num_ .
what a disappointment .
i just went for dinner and ordered the honey mustard glazed salmon .
probably would not go again .
but with each experience , i am less impressed .
the food is moderately priced , but is too much for what you get .
my last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu .
this use to be the go to place because the food was always consistent .
flash forward to now , the tasty grilled portobello sandwich is gone .
i was so sad .
will not be going back .
this particular location is pretty hit or miss .
food sucked .
apparently a tuesday night is busy for the manager ( not the hostess ) .
the loaded baked potato was delicious .
not worth going so much anymore .
that 's highly disgusting .
i was very unimpressed .
looks like we will stick with flying biscuit !
i then chose the cheese and peppers omelette , with egg whites .
so , i chose the omelette .
so , tonight we ordered two linguini and meatballs to go .
we will probably be back , but only after the menu offers better fare .
pretty poor experience here .
not impressed .
very forgettable .
that was _num_ mins ago !
is this your corporate policy or just an issue with your provider ?
she was very helpful and knowledgeable .
please avoid this place .
the chicken salad is made with turkey .
there was 1/4 lb .
so , i ordered the chicken cheesesteak , fries and some coleslaw .
the cheesesteak was soggy .
not as crispy as others stated and they needed salt !
the paper tickets are so _num_ 's .
what i received was just turkey .
they are officially on the back end of my list of best delis .
owners must suck every dime out of the business .
staff is completely incompetent .
( lie # _num_ ) .
( lie # _num_ ) .
no thanks .
the patient is not seen as an equal partner .
very hurt and upset with this business .
extremely poor service .
that , to me , says a lot about their skill level .
the apartments were great _num_ years ago , now not so much .
it 's been like this for the last _num_ months .
i would never recommend living here .
horrible .
no help at all .
the pool is never clean .
lived there for almost _num_ years , at the very back if it matters .
my car was almost stolen once even with an alarm on it ?
if you ever have a problem you are seriously sol .
one last thing , their maintenance guys are f ; in creepy !
this is where yelping has become my source of self help .
our mild salsa never arrived .
sure i will be back , but with lower expectations .
the refried beans was like sauce .
the food did n't taste right .
service was extremely grumpy .
absolutely no excuse for that !
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
is this a one person salon that can not resolve an problem like this ?
she offers this friday at _num_ or 2pm .
that makes no sense .
horrible service !
to get home so that i could write it down .
horrible front desk service !
no letter , nothing !
this situation takes the icing of the cake though .
Neutral
maybe it 's just chinese places that stop serving ?
the chicken wings use to be one of the highlights of going here .
not anymore .
i read today in south charlotte weekly that they recieved a grade of _num_ .
customer service is lacking .
the waitresses said little to nothing ( which is the usual case ) .
really this place just needs to be more hospitable .
i am a sushi snob , and am extremely particular about my sushi .
we also ordered pan fried pork with kimchi .
we have not been back .
venue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in japan .
sushi - the unagi ( eel ) was cooked perfectly .
they need better selections in sushi .
as for sushi , i would only come here once .
also , if you do n't tip enough .
terrible service .
the sushi set i ordered was a typical americanized sushi affair .
not authentic at all .
i was very unimpressed .
neither were anything special .
the chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce .
was not good at all .
worst sashimi experience ever .
none were busy .
i 'd suggest to check everything before you leave the store .
looks like very other cvs .
painfully slow .
i sent in a photo order online ( same day prints ) .
it took this cvs at least _num_ days to process the order .
am i missing something ?
yep , mandatory .
worst management ever .
of course nothing happened on monday .
all they want is your money !
$ _num_ snacks .
$ _num_ coffee .
no , thank you .
service is spotty and knowledge of wine / training of servers has dropped significantly .
but , we wanted to try the tuscan beans so stayed .
i repeat this was a bottle listed on the menu not from the retail .
d & d is expensive .
however , the food quality simply does n't warrant the cost .
a piece of two layer cake , is over six dollars .
my husband and i come to the wine room often because we live nearby .
i ca n't believe it .
it pains me to write this review !
i 'll be back to d & d but not to the wine room !
worst service ever .
what a horrible experience .
just opened them up an poured .
he also offered me a free lunch on the house which i turned down .
bill came to $ _num_ .
wine prices even higher than paris or london .
they only cost _num_ in paris and _num_ in the rest of the country .
had we just stayed on the market side it would be fine .
she suggested we grab some wine and take it back into the market .
the spaghetti and mussels were pretty good though .
i grew up going to the south park location .
hence why i needed the coffee .
no excuse for this .
dumb .
stupid .
they did n't even deserve a one star .
the _num_ bedroom apartment we rented was a fucking dump when we moved in .
we gave a written notice to the leasing manager and a doctors letter .
bad decision .
i 'm terrified of those things .
terrible experience !
horrible place to live !
disturbing .
nothing had improved .
i 'm beyond disgusted .
that is n't enough to make us love the place though .
gross , what happened ?
it was way too salty !
i find the rice in any chinese buffet way much better !
when we walked in we were seated promptly in a nice section .
just awful !
consider yourself warned .
it felt like a dish that had been reheated in the microwave .
years ago , this place was my favorite restaurant .
apps were cold .
waiter was loud and too casual .
sea bass was steamed spinach coated in soy sauce .
this place could have gotten a better score but for the service .
not well designed .
wo n't be back .
it 's on the pricey side , but you probably know that already .
it takes money to keep the engine running .
maybe i am spoiled but in every p.f .
looks like they are having staffing problems .
the menu changes are n't necessarily better .
my changs spare ribs were just northern style ribs with bbq sauce on them .
poor customer service .
tonight i wanted to grab a quick brew before a yelp event .
not so much .
no big deal .
too late dude .
i kept bringing the _num_ month old outside to walk around .
from now on , i 'll stick to take-out .
never again .
never have i had so much anxiety having a meal .
very disappointing experience recently .
worst experience .
when did this place get expensive ?
small portions and pricey lunch .
not nice ... .
not nice ... .
yuck !
my wife and i went to pf changs tonight for dinner .
my wife got the honey glazed chicken and i got the sichuan beef .
the only tasty dish was our appetizer lettuce wrap .
caution to anyone having that craving for good upscale chinese food .
raspberry sauce is sitting out on my counter as i continue eating cake .
so disgusted !
called pf changs where the first `` manager '' sent me to another manager .
it made me sick .
i have shopped at harris teeter park road for over _num_ years .
it is _num_ park rd harris teeter .
will not come back .
eh , went here on christmas for dinner .
wine was outrageously overpriced .
been there _num_ times .
not a big fan .
slow and inattentive .
the choices were pumpkin or chocolate pecan pie .
it is impossible get from a to b outside or inside the place .
we asked ... should we get out own menus ?
so , we ordered the veal and chicken parm .
up to ~ $ _num_ ) .
desert choices were flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake .
way overpriced and not worth the trip !
noisy , noisy bar !
if you want a great steakhouse , go to ruth 's chris .
it just was n't that good .
i will not be back !
lastly , we made our reservations through open table , which was honored .
not quite sure what the target market is for this place .
capital grille two weeks ago , my son , same thing .
not impressed with the food .
ok food , not too exceptional .
not to return , i am afraid .
velvet corn and chicken soup was tasty but needed lots of pepper .
no crab .
the dumplings were just okay .
waited a long time to try this place .
staff is rude .
i was highly disappointed .
the least she could have done was to put a credit on my account .
it is jessica fault !
give me a break !
the eggs i ordered scrambled and they were too dry for me .
so , to anyone reading this , i would look for another breakfast option .
i do not get it .
the manager could n't have cared less .
it will be a long time before we consider another visit .
_num_ .
not so much here .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
speaking of coffee , their coffee is brutal .
_num_ .
she ended up sitting on my lap to eat .
pancakes and bacon horrible .
the layout is terrible !
horrible customer service .
also they had problems with their soda machine .
the atmosphere is less friendly .
next time we want greek food , we 'll go to the mad greek .
a little more pricey but it caught my eye .
except maybe on small business saturday .
i have spent thousands of dollars at this store .
pedicure turned out good , but manicure not so much .
can i rate less than a star ?
not fair to the customer at all .
the sales staff ( if you can call them that ) were complete snobs .
later i am still dealing with their screw ups .
ordered a very a very large and heavy coat rack .
wow , were has customer service gone ?
however , they will not get my money .
so let me go over this : i have a coupon .
me - _num_ , her - _num_ .
customer service was terrible .
highly recommend not buying a suit here .
not helpful at all !
terrible experience !
the lady almost asked for the double price after doing the job .
would not recommend .
what a disappointment .
we ordered two seafood entrees , two beers , and an order of sushi .
meeting our friends there for a sunday bite was nice .
disappointing .
overly salted entree as well as very salty side of roasted mushrooms .
while tasty , the portions are small .
bad decision .
bad service .
what a disappointment .
they had n't been cleaned properly .
the egg on my wife 's eggs benedict was over-cooked .
returning to the buffet , my wife said the shrimp was very salty .
most were stale .
i went in to ship a package that i needed to return to amazon .
unbelievably poor customer service .
this is completely unacceptable .
they refuse to do anything about it .
i took them back and the cleaners cleaned them for free .
terrible business .
would not recommend .
the service was awful .
not going back .
this particular location has really let me down !
the breadsticks box had grease leaked all over .
both the pizza and the breadsticks are not the quality i used to .
highly disappointed all around .
i am in search of a new salon definitely !
Negative
i 'm not kidding .
it gets worse .
she also spent the entire time trying to up sell me .
awful awful .
it just wasnt enough food for the price .
there was also some take-out business at the same time .
service : initially good
waitress : our food was served with rice and meat .
and the box for the food is _num_ $ .
i try calling out to her too , saying `` ms. ?
he is clearly as mad as i am .
somehow i feel like they have served chicken from the day before .
worst customer service .
not worth it .
crab rangoon is soggy .
this review is n't about the food as much as the service .
however , i never like my food !
very disappointed .
way downhill .
has it come to reviewing fast food joints ?
yes , i wrote a letter , i 'm that guy .
anywho , it went a little something like this .
i stopped on the way to the theatre , to grab a bite .
i asked for my money back and left .
big mistake .
the two dancers i did see where not all that great looking .
the bartenders appeared to be better looking then the two dancers .
i 've never been a big drinker ; over priced beer and soda .
well , it 's been better than it is now .
the people are quite possibly the rudest i have ever met .
i have not met anyone there with a personality yet .
walk-in customers will be treated with less effort than existing customers .
it was too late .
a cut through the middle made it impossible to correct .
i requested a firm drive it out quote via email .
still no email quote .
the advertised prices were _num_ .
then they offered me the sale at _num_ which they claimed was their cost .
terrible sales staff .
my trade was only worth about half of what carmax said it was ?
your brake pads & shoes have _num_ % left he said .
wrong .
the mechanic says basic .
and i said , my car requires a synthetic blend .
comes back a minute later and asks for my keys .
i 'll utilize another tour company during my next charlotte visit .
the rest was mediocre .
smh worst service every ... .
ordered sesame chicken and it came with two pieces of broccoli .
the sesame chicken sucks .
like i mean seriously drive past this place .
the kitchen is in plain view of the customers which is nice .
the service was not very good .
the portions are large and the prices are very inexpensive .
i would recommend the lunch specials such as the hunan shrimp .
although if you are looking for spicy , i would order extra spicy .
recently had my son 's 9th birthday party here .
not a fan .
the cole slaw i had was drenched in mayo , like water .
horrible !
avoid at all costs !
the hamburger steak was ok .
the squash was flavorless .
_num_ stars was being generous .
right at _num_ , glasses were given out to a few tables around us .
slow service .
horribly under staffed .
our service was slow .
i 'm skeptical though .
if you are going for food check the score before you walk in !
i was all ready to give this place a good review .
very poor experience .
the only flying you should be doing here is flying right past the place .
i will not be back .
it is open _num_ hours .
a breakfast place that has been in the area a long time .
the food was very basic and a little greasy .
unacceptable .
so i ended up taking whatever she could find .
otherwise , i 'm switching to national or avis .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
fifth problem : i called and emailed customer service about my charge .
next time it avis or anyone else beside hertz .
avoid this place !
what a lousy experience .
not a great hertz location and they need much better signage and training .
car was ok otherwise .
i am a gold member at hertz .
they did n't seem to care .
worst service ever !
even though we had a reservation we were made to wait for a car .
ugh .
they really need to change their system here .
never again will i rent from them .
_num_ minute wait in line to exit the rental car location .
no cars .
no service .
name is not listed on the board .
rent from somebody else if you have the choice .
total failure .
avoid !
drove locally around charlotte for two days and used about 1/4 tank .
horrible .
horrible treatment .
word to the wise , choose another company if at all possible .
ridiculous .
i have probably rented from over a _num_ different hertz locations .
this is the busiest rental car place ive ever been at .
it was kind of confusing .
find another rental car service at charlotte airport .
lousy scratched up car .
this service really sucks .
reservations are not honored even if prepaid .
i showed up and had reserved a full size car .
not really what i would call a full size , but that 's fine .
that was not ideal .
disaster !
so far ... not so good .
do not rent here .
no , no , and no !
maybe it 's just hertz .
and i mean all day .
i even cut up my gold membership card already .
i was there on vacation and went to pick up my rental car .
just to rent a car for _num_ hrs ?
he did not care one bit .
rented a car on the way back for $ _num_ bucks with budget .
no deposit .
my mother had the same experience with the same _num_ companies .
the inventory was limited .
will not use them again .
grab any car in the lane and drive away .
no soup for you !
after around half and hour , the transaction was finally completed .
avoid this disaster .
avoid this terrible hertz .
never again will i use hertz .
horrible !
there were other customers of hertz with the same situation as well .
the worst .
do n't bother .
car did n't work .
_num_ others in same situation .
stay away from hertz .
the rental ended up being way more expensive than i had originally thought .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i drove for like _num_ miles .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
give me the keys and i 'll find the freaking car for you .
absurd .
another less than impressive showing by hertz .
slow an confused counter staff .
i guess they figured i 'd likely keep it for another week .
terrible service ... .
unbelievable .
wish hertz was more understanding .
horrible !
customer service sucks .
just absolutely horrible .
rented a car over a month ago for our flight into charlotte at 6pm .
none at all .
it was _num_ hours !
we waited another _num_ mins for another car .
that ridiculous !
do n't come to hertz .
this hertz location is a complete toss up .
plus , the ratio of staff to customers is too low .
showed up in nc for a business meeting .
i normally book with enterprise , hertz , and avis .
if you do n't like your job , quit .
never again , national .
very disappointed !
i am also disabled and have a service animal .
agent : rude .
manager : rude .
horrible people .
enterprise .
will not go here again .
was quoted $ _num_ and charged $ _num_ .
i ordered a quarter pound they gave me a 1/3 pound .
the food was bad !
the service was pitiful !
skip it !
nothing special about it .
nothing was authentic and nothing was fresh .
the wait staff act as if their last job was at the dmv !
totally reminded me of a mexican soup nazi attitude !
tried this place tonight after reading the reviews .
salsa was just okay .
and , they make their enchiladas with white cheese which is not authentic mexican .
staff was not friendly .
very disappointed !
got my order wrong .
worst burritos ever .
terrible .
not as good as i used to come before .
i will not eat here again .
that would mostly considered as cheap customers .
i just need to look for another place for my favorite mexican food .
stick with cold subs .
would 've taken _num_ min .
i could go on forever .
gross , gross , gross !
then there was no elevators .
when returning to bed , i discovered what appeared to be a bed bug .
all cities are not the same .
this hotel is billed on-line as a _num_ star hotel .
i recently stayed here through priceline .
i was pretty disappointed .
the airline put me up in this hotel for the night .
a/c unit was very loud .
there are a couple nicer options nearby that probably do n't cost much more .
i had to walk up and down every time to get it to work again.
cleanliness is not a priority here .
hotwire is the reason for all my problems .
we stayed a week for a conference .
the bathrooms are a little small .
toilet paper is cheap .
no microwave in room .
i then start looking for a menu and there is none to be found .
they 've got _num_ types to choose from .
this is the first and only showmars i 've visited .
there are about _num_ of them in the charlotte area .
i could n't finish it .
both were completely flavorless .
the tzatziki sauce was okay same with the greek salad .
sorry showmars .
i stopped by to pick up some dinner after i landed at airport .
i chose your fried steak with green and salad to go .
besides salad , i almost have to throw the rest away .
not to mention the price was about $ _num_ .
still searching for a good chinese food place here in charlotte .
we had to flag down another server to get our toast .
it was not good at all .
will not return here .
it was not .
i do not recommend .
do not recommend at all .
communication is horrible !
it was all very dated .
fuck this place fuck this college , fuck the staff .
i was not impressed !
typical chicken place .
horribly slow service !
i 've been here numerous times with the same results .
slow slow slow and slow !
avoid at all costs .
they would just sell all there stuff and buy new on the other end .
sell your furniture or pay anyone off the street before calling these guys .
my move came _num_ days late .
Neutral
but not good at all .
rice is reheated .
gross !
the chicken was extremely crispy .
the rice was flavorless .
i did n't finish my food .
how ironic !
the bbq was cold and dry .
it just was n't that good .
they may ask you where the food came from ?
my girlfriend ordered the fish along with fries and baked beans .
i really like their fried chicken , coleslaw , potato salad and other dishes .
we drove a long drive to try this bbq .
the food came out cold and not fresh .
the server is clueless .
what saved them was the bbq sauce .
nothing special .
sauce again the thin eastern style .
yes , i am going to make a direct comparison between these two establishments .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it smells like an elderly persons home .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i 'm giving it a _num_ star for the food and price .
seriously so bad .
not an option .
the hostess politely said they have had teams cause problems .
so i ca n't tell you how the food is .
the place was empty .
food was mediocre .
we will not be back .
been here many times due to its close my house .
i 'm here now writing this review and the basketball game is on .
i really hate that !
she did n't smile .
i also smell a rat .
please do n't burn the burgers .
ok maybe this was my first and last time at this waffle house .
_num_ minutes .
stopped here on the way to fort jackson .
gross .
blah , so much for sleeping inn at sleep inn .
e. no apology or compensation .
he gave me a confirmation number and everything seemed fine .
avoid bad service and disappointment .
overpriced low quality hibachi .
take your money elsewhere .
have not been to this location in awhile .
i was very disappointed .
both of us ordered pancakes mine was regular pancakes and my husband was blueberry .
not good .
the little bubble in my head said what does she mean by that response .
not a fan of this location .
the toast and hash browns were the only items cooked correctly .
overall horrible experience .
the staff is friendly but pushy when it comes to putting in your order .
_num_ people in lobby waiting while wait staff stand around .
_num_ plate of food for our party comes out while others wait .
cashier checks our card out before we can give tip .
i ordered an avocado chicken caesar salad .
not impressed .
the service is terrible .
instead , i got nothing .
wrong again .
_num_ .
_num_ .
very frustrating overall .
horrible service .
terrible showroom from _num_ .
poor attitude by employee .
i do not like this company .
headed to backyard pools the next time i need something pool related .
ordered my pizza tonight via website .
never ordering from pizza hut again .
avoid like the plague !
i could have saved _num_ % off the price of my food .
unbelievable that they 're still in business .
it has been _num_ .
bad service .
sigh ... never ordering from them again .
so , yeah , thankfully there are plenty of other pizza places near by .
if it was about the pizza you were n't getting it back .
the highlight of the meal actually was dessert .
spinach side was a little bitter .
awful awful awful !
stopped by tonight with a friend .
my friend 's beer had a due date of november _num_ .
i returned my beer and ordered a draft .
it 's wrong again .
went for lunch with family ( wife and _num_ young boys ) .
it was way better !
ps - hiring high school aged girls as `` hostesses '' is almost creepy .
then again - the place is creepy .
this location is n't consistent .
i ca n't stand it .
i 'm not a fan .
shame on you !
this chuck e cheese had the rudest manager i have ever encountered .
they had soooo many birthday celebrations going on as well .
we will not be back .
it tasted old and not very sweet .
_num_ hours before close and i asked for the grilled chicken bites .
i almost left but just ordered fried chicken tenders and too salty fries .
visited two years ago and got chicken that was raw inside .
got my money back and left .
but typical for the entire bojangles chain .
terrible service .
this is the only bojangles i 've ever had a problem with .
this place is terrible !
her response , i 'm waiting on biscuits .
a friend of mine had a philly cheesesteak that used ground beef .
there 's plenty other spots with a lot friendlier staff in charlotte .
will not be returning .
`` you know i 'm a good person ill pay you back . ''
and walked away .
weak drinks .
and rude staff .
i had to scream to someone a foot away from me to be heard .
plus side , our waitress ( kim ) was pretty awesome .
the gave me fried tenders and fries oops !
even with $ _num_ groupon for $ _num_ its still overpriced ... ... .
okay .
overall , not worth it .
same dcor which we like but a new menu .
i was pissed !
after that was taken , our food came out very quickly !
my husband and i have been going to wan fu for years .
it was very rude .
the food was bland .
hate the atmosphere , so dark during the day .
the food is terrible .
if you are only familiar with mall chinese maybe you would like this place .
ca n't say the same for the quality of the food .
however , i decided not to purchase it from this store .
if i acted the way these employees did , i would lose my job .
and on my third trip i made $ _num_ .
nothing overly nice , about the same as a yard sale , but pricier .
the customer next to me asked three more times very nicely for the water .
total waste of money !
this place is empty .
apparently they do n't like business .
the line was endless and crowded .
my husband orders the calamari and i ordered the lobster bisque .
my husband was very dissapointed in the steak and regretted eating it .
i ordered crme brulee and my husband had their almond basket with ice cream .
just ok ? ''
my lasagna was a $ _num_ meal at best .
i was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at a comfy booth .
the second bite was stringy steak .
i was disgusted .
very disappointed .
not impressed .
the answer is try harder to find a source because they are out there .
the cauliflower was good but there spinach all i tasted was vinegar .
the biggest rip-off ever .
i took my dog in got his medication , it cleared up immediately .
i agreed and scheduled the surgery for wednesday .
not a _num_ % credit .
she 's obnoxious .
didnt really seem like the cared either .
i just want to be done with these apartments .
worst apartments ever .
sure they took a few days and gave me light bulbs .
they did n't even fix it .
horrible food .
i ate there over the christmas holidays .
only a _num_ year old could be comfortable eating here .
just crap .
my to go meal ended up being $ _num_ bucks after taxes and tip .
average japanese steakhouse experience .
staff was very friendly ( hostess , waitress and chef ) .
that stuff is nasty .
dude get over it and go make your ring of fire .
i had the fillet , scallops and shrimp .
that is not cool .
just nothing special .
first off , i sat in the sushi bar area .
i have not eaten in the dinner area yet .
i just know better sushi places .
also i had to get a new soy sauce bowl .
probably will only go back for take out .
so not worth it .
very pricey and they automatically add _num_ % gratuity with your bill .
it was very unprofessional .
horrible !
the entire staff was hispanic , not japanese .
the naan bread was like a rubber sheet .
the chicken curry was passable .
Negative
no excuse .
a big f for this .
one can understand , this is charlotte and thus not a indian food destination .
our waiter was friendly , he came to refill our waters twice .
food has never made me feel that way .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
in my opinion , this is an americanized indian restaurant .
_num_ .
not satisfied !
_num_ .
it was horrible .
saw a huge roach on the wall .
wish i could give it less .
i only wish i had taken a picture of the buffet to prove it .
anyway i 'm sure they will be closed soon .
i just came from lunch with coworkers here .
ordered the shrimp and mixed vegetables , was served the shrimp and broccoli .
probably all the same sauce anyway .
and now i 'm craving fortune cookie .
next time ill pass .
cold , hard and greasy .
two people in our party ordered chicken broccoli with fried rice and egg rolls .
one person got white rice instead of fried rice as ordered .
the waitress did offer to get the fried rice .
i had eaten here before and it was much better in the past .
maybe just have some soup for lunch .
horrible customer service !
never have experienced anything like this before !
what great wall of china south serves is cheap , frozen egg rolls .
absolutely horrible experience .
had to wait forever for our check .
just disgusting .
this place is bad !
worst chinese food ever !
no go .
the food however was not .
gone downhill .
service was awful .
when finally the entree arrived it was relatively without taste .
my husband and i went this past saturday for dinner .
because i usually judge a restaurant for being authentic if their own people go .
i was wrong .
have n't been there in about _num_ years and man has it changed .
the hot and sour soup is exactly that .
nothing special to write about .
went back yesterday after passing over for several years .
again not a real problem just one part of the entire experience .
i had a groupon so i check this place out .
the next time i went was for a lunch on saturday .
the place did seem busy , which i think is because of the groupon .
the shrimp in my dish were the really small cheap shrimp .
it is essentially just fast food in a sit down restaurant .
it was all so blah .
so i only ordered lunch .
it was so bad .
thanks but no thanks !
i have not been back .
went to thai house on a thursday around 8pm .
to use up a groupon , we had dinner there last night .
it should be thicker than what i ate .
beef pieces were small .
_num_ .
duck curry was okay .
_num_ .
any household can prepare those at home without much efforts .
_num_ .
as an exception to other thai restaurants , attendant lady was courteous .
i 'm not a fan really .
so i decided to try thai house again as my craving was strong .
essentially for me , it 's like fast food quality .
_num_ for beef basil ?
skip this place .
i ate it just because i was hungry .
the decor in the restaurant was nice though .
not likely to try again though .
and my husbands roasted chicken was frozen in the inside but cooked through ?
so , goodbye $ _num_ curry .
i always keep my university thai house leftovers for a second meal .
my chicken pad thai tasted too sweet .
very little chicken in both the soup and the drunken noodle .
Positive
very bad service .
like many successful restaurants this one too - tanks .
when all else fails this place was so reliable .
not anymore i guess .
however , we had the papaya salad as an appetizer and that was great .
went tonight and ordered pad thai .
disgusting .
we also ended up with _num_ waitresses .
not impressed , left hungry .
never ... have my prescriptions ever been ready on time .
terrible .
i had my reservations about stopping at this location tonight .
i will not be back !
then i was confused .
this is the only chinese restaurant i like in charlotte .
u can find all the yummy food on the authentic menu .
my favorite is the beef noodle and the pig feet .
just like other yucky american chinese restaurant now !
got shrimp with mixed vegetables .
also got the teriyaki beef which was like shoe leather ( very tough ) .
will not be going back .
crispy noodles were stale .
i went here for a nostalgic feeling , but the food was shabby .
very poor service .
john at the paint counter could use some customer service training .
i am going to give up on lowes .
worst experience !
i would probably not return here .
terrible !
cost was $ _num_ .
looked nothing like the picture .
she had smoked wings with ranch dressing , they arrived with barbecue sauce .
this time was n't so great .
daughter ordered classic burger with fries and our appetizer was the new fried pickles .
the pickles came out fast and were very hot .
finally the entrees come and low and behold my pasta is the regular way .
i am so disappointed .
all the waitresses know me and stop by and talk .
the fries were horrible .
horrible !
park _num_ cafe is under new management .
well scratch the quick now .
bad food , horrible service .
place is garbage .
we waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check .
the positives are that the staff were friendly and worked quickly .
i can not imagine complaints about portion size !
moderately busy , but seated right away .
wo n't be returning .
you can tell they use cheap steak and lobster .
i literally had my soup and salad delivered within _num_ seconds of each other .
then the chef comes out to rush us .
large portions of noodles and vegetables .
does n't work .
that is just wrong .
it 's not very good .
very disappointing .
too expensive for what you get .
a lot of veggies very little steak or chicken .
the server and chef were very efficient and personable .
wo n't go back .
salon has changed hands ( again ) and not for better .
( repeat , repeat .
so i left -- for good .
no flavor .
vegetarian lunch was bland .
they have new and used books , all separated into their various sections .
a takeout place in a supermarket ?
no thanks .
sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times , you miss out .
i 've never lucked out here .
it 's so crammed and so messy .
floor was sticky .
so rude and painfully slow .
as politely as i could .
they have me a baked potato .
what an insult .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i used to really like outback in nj but i 'm in nc now .
disappointing .
really disappointed .
i order sirloin and grilled prawns .
i have been going to this outback for _num_ years .
this outback is horrible .
extremely slow !
the print on the menu is tiny and the lights are dim .
it has cheese fries added to it .
what a shame !
i could 've said yellow for all she cared .
however , they were very shady at the end .
first off , a heads up .
went with a group of about _num_ - _num_ people on a thursday night .
the service was slow .
even taco bell 's tacos were better tasting than this one .
i would not recommend uptown retreat .
it was a disaster .
so my hair is lighter on the top and darker on the bottom .
but it makes me wan na go try caribou coffee .
not something i 'd regularly do .
the caribou associates know how to treat customers .
they 're tasty and pretty cheap .
another thing they need to drop are those chopped salads .
still not worth it !
i made zero errors .
i do n't get it .
i wish i had done the same .
i usually know this , but jay talked me into it .
i feel like i 'm in the 80s at this movie theater .
the meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful .
oh , and as for that `` cheap '' bit .
not the best mexican restaurant .
avoid if you can .
terrible .
um ... no !
chips are obviously from bags .
the rice was bland .
service was mediocre .
i used to like it alot .
i 've waited longer at taco bell , and had better tacos .
now , my street tacos on the other hand is a completely different story .
i could n't even eat them .
there was lettuce and guac on the side .
my family visited the restaurant recently .
customer service was horrible .
yet , he comes back with extra texas pete drenched on my wings .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
no bill no nothing .
so dissapointed ( as are neighbors of ours ) .
delivered wrong pizza .
poor customer service .
being from louisiana , i 'm a huge smoothie king fan .
their general smoothie recipe is now _num_ % ice and _num_ % fruit juice .
there are some positives .
place is dirty .
will not go back .
it was just terrible .
it is also very expensive ( _num_ for a small ) .
we will not be back .
but this place deserves the _num_ stars .
maintenance takes weeks to fix things .
prices are n't great for what you 're getting .
would not recommend to a friend .
rip off apartment complex .
do not rent here .
horrible place to live .
my air conditioning broke down a total of four times my stay here .
worst place to live !
i was thrilled to go and get my oh so favorite breakfast bowl .
no , thanks .
when i was given my dish , it was a alfredo sauce .
tried my coworkers penne vodka , and that was tasty !
terrible .
terrible terrible .
terrible terrible terrible .
food was bad .
bad idea .
pity as i like to support the local businesses .
would not recommend .
horrible dinner .
this place sucked .
they ca n't cook pasta .
the place just sucked .
obviously frozen product , blah .
big disappointment was received .
usually will give a place at least two times but not in this case .
i know chains tend to be more expensive but this price difference was unreal .
he gave me a more reasonable price .
never go back there again .
they are there for the money not to reply cater to the customer .
it does n't matter how hard i slam this place .
how can i describe my experience here ?
the shrimp tasted like ... nothing .
do i deserve this ?
i mean ... shrimp from chilis ?
truly awful .
very gross .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the meat patty was coated and then deep fried .
it was like oil on oil .
the biscuit itself was ok .
i 'm not entirely sure what the fuss about bojangles is .
the food selection is basically wings , burgers and pizza .
same practice same reason double the amount .
i do n't get it .
i want to know what fool made this decision .
gross .
but this restaurant was not clean .
there was dust around the windows and possible old ketchup .
never had a problem calling in orders at any other showmars .
no ... .
deposit on the room that should be refunded in about a week .
terribly , terribly thin .
do not stay here .
false alarm .
are you kidding me ?
also , think about buying the warranty on used cars .
finally , being open 24/7 is a plus at least .
horrible customer service .
the old location would usually be moderately busy .
every time i visit this starbucks , it is completely slammed .
they are usually friendly though .
my boyfriend and i booked a room on the executive floor for new years .
very lackluster .
ok , i just ate a science project .
check-in at the hilton university place was a breeze .
i sent back the flatbread .
she was more than gracious and apologetic .
this level of noise makes sleep difficult .
as for the food , it was just okay .
i walked into the store looking for yellow flowers .
i saw _num_ women chatting in the work area and another near the counter .
called trying to get info to put together some arrangements .
obviously this is insane .
slow .
not much else to say .
this makes no sense .
always slow .
its close , so this is where i go .
my family of _num_ is staying here while our house is being worked on .
will not stay here again !
surly staff that was never at the desk .
thank goodness i was staying on the first floor with my disabled mother .
made a reservation in june for july .
the place was not even that busy .
at the same time , this chain is past its prime .
they might have to teach their cooks how to cook a steak .
yep , that loud .
the service was slow .
then i ate there and was reminded .
eating there made me realize why i never actually go eat there .
poor service !
i am calling the gm !
service was questionable .
tonight was horrible !
i did n't put it in .
it looked like it was under cooked .
i ordered the chicken sandwich which tasted much better .
it was not good .
zero stars for me .
they literally messed up on every single person at the tables order .
then it was loud , due to people , and the bartenders .
horrible service .
horrible horrible horrible .
horrible .
i really think our waitress forgot to put our order in .
the service here sucks .
the place was out of control .
not a sign of management .
tables were n't clean .
i will not be back ever !
service is extremely slow .
they need a complete overhaul of management and employees .
server was simply lousy .
sanitation grade _num_ .
do n't recommend .
my husband & i , went here for lunch .
the menu was alot different than the last time we was at applebees . ]
very bad service .
the food itself was eh .
it was bad .
we ordered two caesar salads , and she brought two house salads .
wrong .
not very customer service oriented .
i highly doubt we will be returning to this restaurant .
she was totally inept .
we managed to flag down another waitress and asked for silverware and napkins .
walked into the smallest waiting area i 've ever seen in a sit-down establishment .
the server did all that she could but damn !
it 's soup and a wedge salad .
we still stayed because i insisted on applebee 's .
some overpriced crackers , nuts , or pretzels .
do not go to this location .
really disappointed .
disappointing .
my name was the next one not marked off .
big mistake coming here .
Negative
i got there just to try the new triple steak sandwich .
avoid !
staff appears confused regularly .
avoid !
i had to get up and find my waitress myself .
on top of that the food was very salty and greasy .
one pancake i couldnt actually bite into .
i would not come back .
wrong !
the food was old and somewhat cold .
have n't gone back since .
they even gave me a hard time about making a new order .
worst customer service ever !
horrible .
there were n't many choices at the bar .
i 'm allergic to smoke .
no refund .
there was so much fat , and it was fairly tough .
i went with a `` lunch '' sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast .
and it was n't even tender !
am i asking for too much ?
food was not good .
service was not good .
he started off by saying `` just _num_ '' .
horrible .
really horrible .
their screen setup could be awesome , except they are n't hd .
the local coworkers were n't fans of it either .
_num_ people ordered wine , and the first _num_ got it in wine glasses .
no bueno .
i didnt taste any alcohol .
not consistent .
)
let me say , this place is not somewhere to eat .
it 's a drinking place .
wrong .
the salad was good , the ribs were as tough as leather .
the service was horrible .
it was a mess .
dismissive associates ... .
the sheets also had holes in them .
least professional staff i have ever seen .
on morning one of my visit i accidentally broke the waffle batter machine .
rant over .
not good .
there was a smell as soon as i walked in the room .
the front desk staff were very courteous and the coffee and breakfast was acceptable .
only deserving of _num_ stars .
everything about this place screams a budget hotel , except for the price .
otherwise , do n't be fooled .
i can not trust them .
i do not recommend .
if i could give it _num_ i would .
more midnight traffic than a _num_ hour dennys .
oh , and the free breakfast was nothing more than dry cereal and juice .
the milk pitcher was never once refilled .
i will never return to this dump ever again !
it made me worry what smell they were trying to cover up .
but , for the extremely low price ... what did i expect .
shower was covered in soap scum .
gross !
and sushi is sushi is sushi if they are rolled correctly .
i know that the economy has been hard on everyone , but whoa .
now , i 'm going to update my review from my _num_ review .
menu is pretty standard as far as hibachi grill food items goes .
so , this was definitely a reason to try this restaurant out .
so , lets get back to the menu .
steam rice on the other hand is free ( which i picked ) .
fried rice : eggs , sesame seed , and soy sauce .
bland .
and mind , i ate two of my party 's portion on noodles .
that 's not it !
the miso soup was hot but the taste only average .
it was absolutely too much .
one of the pieces i received was totally different from what i ordered .
sorry i wo n't recommend .
oh , no !
the sushi guy has major attitude .
it had carrots in it .
then they brought out my fried rice .
what struck me so quickly was how thin the sashimi was cut !
when i mean thin , i mean thin enough to see through the slice !
i was offended .
not here .
it was probably the least delicious hibachi i have ever been to .
i would not recommend this hibachi .
the milk shake was taking long so i begin eating my room temp nuggets .
way to keep business drew .
it was actually painfully slow .
i again insisted on speaking to a member of management .
another associate handled the actual exchange transaction .
more business than they wish to handle .
it certainly was not me .
worst place ever !
very rude .
ordered online , waited a month for delivery date .
day comes and they miss the _num_ hour delivery window .
no one called , no apologies .
asked if they would guarantee it would be here this time ?
the company never responded to my questions in the store or online .
worse experience ever .
worst delivery experience ever .
terrible experience !
do not buy this couch !
the first time was so-so , the second time was better .
sushi was mushy .
vegetables limp and overlooked .
all sauces were too sweet and most tasted the same .
it was n't even warm .
good for a cheap lunch , but very americanized selection .
greasy unappetizing fried food .
low quality ingredients .
decent food if you 're not a chinese food enthusiast .
horrible service .
had the $ _num_ lunch and it was exactly what i expected .
not a great selection of food .
last week i stopped by to get the battery of my watch changed .
are you kidding me ?
it pains me to write this review .
i was recently at this store to make an expensive jewelry purchase .
not a fan !
i do not recommend this dentist .
disgusting !
unbelievable .
it 's probably cause its just meant for sports and drinks .
but for those who like drinks and sports this would be your spot !
terrible .
the service is terrible !
i will not go again .
nasty .
other customers also were returning meals .
i had two items : a caesar salad , and a margherita pizza .
it was covered with chopped green herbs .
my wife got mama 's trio .
another ordered the fried calamari appetizer ( $ _num_ ) .
this was a disappointment .
another of us ordered the chicken parm ( $ _num_ ) .
nothing special there .
their close proximity does n't win out over quality .
do they have a corporate taste kitchen ?
it was a bucket of dry pasta with some cheese and meat .
a poached egg on top ?
not the way to do it .
i would n't get it again .
worst dining experience ever .
we were visiting friends in charlotte and chose macaroni grill to meet .
this was a work lunch so i had to attend .
hostess greeted the group quickly and was ready to seat us .
not a great presentation of the dining area .
will not be visiting again .
terrible service .
the food sucked !
so i picked this place to change his mind .
he ordered a pork dish and i had lobster ravioli .
and it tasted so microwaved .
please avoid this restaurant !
but it was like that through the whole entire meal .
she was very apologetic .
just another chain food restaurant .
i long for a real deli in charlotte !
food was meh , nothing special .
slow service .
this is the second time this has happened in less than a month .
this is an email i received from what seems to be the manager .
very rude .
we only stayed one night and went back home .
do not trust this days in .
no refund given .
rude and unprofessional .
all i got was a smoking room .
went back and changed and got another smokers room .
do not trust this days in .
they stole my money .
i lost money .
it 's that bad !
also note they lie when you fight it with your bank .
same price by the airport and your in a luxury .
do n't trust this pace .
rooms are disgusting .
sheets looked old .
same price and so much better .
the breakfast was weak .
never going back .
expansive menu from italian to greek , even mexican !
portion large enough for _num_ meals .
cleaning of the room is suppose to be on tuesday .
i would not stay here again .
however , besides that one situation , they typically seem to care .
they 're also very expensive .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
small dogs may be different .
took my puppy there for the first time this week .
horrible !
i will not be going back !
i was wrong .
i am so stressed out and very worried .
i am extremely disappointed .
would not recommend !
they deserve zero stars .
stay away !
nothing special .
very comparable to have an entree and _num_ sides .
i 'm so glad we split it .
however , they brought out one salad and one meal .
however , afterwards , both of us mentioned it to each other .
not going back .
i never once got a refill , even when i asked .
never once have i been told the tip amounts at a restaurant .
i was immediately disgusted .
i assume she was the general manager .
oh and drinks for lunch are very expensive !
$ _num_ for a lemonade !
my father was in this facility for a short time ( _num_ days ) .
i 'm not that impressed .
terrible job !
will not go back .
inspection slow and unprofessional .
i wrote an email using their contact us form and never heard anything back .
very disappointed !
one time i saw an old lady take a taxi through the drive thru .
very disappointed .
the most ghetto ran wendy 's i have ever been to .
it was cold and old food .
never had a problem at this one until today .
not something you just feel like free styling .
i 've been craving breadsticks since i picked up some from target .
bland $ _num_ of waste !
on average probably twice a month .
so tonight i called my order in ( i usually do it online ) .
but hey , that 's just me .
i reply that i assure him that i 'm not lying about it .
delivery even on busy nights like saturday is faster than the others .
luckily i do n't mind coke ... .
the dining room always looks closed .
like a cup of water mixed condiments was poured on the burger .
if you want a surprise burger , go to this bk .
pulled off to the same freaking messed up order !
the sesame chicken was just okay , as was the general and orange chicken .
chicken was way over cooked .
terrible !
tried this place because i was referred by a friend .
bland .
gross .
terrible .
not a chance .
as i left i suggested the manager change this policy .
my first try was with the meatballs and pasta .
standard italian food - nothing i could buy at the grocery store .
no frills .
not my ideal chicken parm !
?
umm , why the double tax ?
this place is gross .
she looked at my shirts .
had a _num_ month old shirt cleaned here .
just got a shirt destroyed there .
service was weak .
service was slow .
_num_ stars .
very disappointing .
not happening again .
i would rate a _num_ .
just does n't cut it .
gross !
i did n't eat it .
that 's $ _num_ for _num_ drinks .
the boyfriend lives down the street and we went for breakfast today .
the service was terrible .
ugh .
did n't like it !
big mistake .
the server kept forgetting to bring requested items , mixed everyone 's orders up .
they were cut too thin and therefore hard to control the cooking temperature .
they were not seasoned well .
a good steak never requires steak sauce .
_num_ ) the private room was great but never warmed up .
_num_ ) the server was as good as you could ever ask for .
my real issue is with the eggs they served me .
since it is so close i will probably return for drinks but not food .
servers are awesome , the food is a hole in a wall quality .
rip off .
i can not tell you how mad this company makes me .
the next thing i know , i am in collection for $ _num_ .
however , here is how they contacted me .
just poor service .
it 's not worth it .
big disappointment .
ordered cashew chicken , hot and spicy beef and kung pao chicken .
ridiculous .
terrible .
_num_ .
_num_ .
simply terrible .
this place is overrated .
not a word in _num_ months .
i 've walked in to make purchases .
i 'm usually met with `` next register .
none offered .
this is really frustrating .
terrible customer service .
will not go again .
not good !
really , not good .
i was so disappointed .
not good at all .
so that was a strange start .
this place is terrible .
probably the rudest receptionist and office staff we have ever encountered .
at that time , one of the hair stylist went out back .
zero stars .
was pleasantly greeted on the phone and my order was taken down promptly .
not many people in there tonight so the selection of pizza seemed minimal tonight .
i have had a meatball sub and stuffed shells and they are both ok .
i was told _num_ min .
well _num_ turned into _num_ .
but it 's not great .
he put me in the first room , next to the front desk .
too bad .
ridiculous .
Negative
the service is awful .
dirty and nasty .
the parking lot is a bit weird to access .
i did n't check the bathrooms .
this particular store sets the bar to a new low .
i will never be back .
the spot we stayed in was quite long , and very level .
not at all impressed .
no security whatsoever !
no gates .
really only space for our 5th wheel .
not long enough or wide enough for your vehicle too .
i honestly can not see giving this establishment a rating higher than a _num_ .
i pointed out that there is a grocery store within walking distance .
wrong .
there is much more that i can say but this is already a novel .
long story short .
ridiculous .
it so deserves less than minus !
i feel like they hate any one to go in their office .
less than zero .
( _num_ ) size of the bathroom .
( _num_ ) cleanliness .
however , it is in the process of being renovated .
they checked me into someone else 's room .
still the general manager has not returned a phone call or a text message .
i probably would not go back .
luckily for me , i live in rock hill .
secondly , there were ants everywhere !
eggplant parm was salty .
the breading was thicker than the veal .
very forgettable .
i would not recommend at all .
she understood but it was the owners call .
and the pizza was n't good .
it 's a shame .
we may try this place again , maybe for the lunch buffet .
our waiter greeted us nearly as soon as we walked through the door .
becky noticed it too .
not much in the way of flavor though .
becky ordered some meat with chile sauce which came first .
only people in the place and the waitress messed up a simple order .
it 's awful .
it was an expensive craft beer .
just want people to understand truth in advertising .
after dinner we went on the deck so my daughter could feed the ducks .
it is only for people sitting at the bar .
not good for food .
cost us _num_ bucks for _num_ orders of ribs with one side and soda .
the food was terrible .
my husband and i came here for lunch on a thursday .
the wait staff was helpful and service was quick .
not hot and sorta greasy .
you pay for a choice cut of meat and get waffle house food .
i went to this place probably _num_ years ago .
was not impressed then .
has gotten worse .
no good .
i feel as though i needed to write this review .
and others as well.
you 've been warned !
poor to standard food .
can be difficult to get a drink sometimes as it does get busy .
french fries were under cooked .
it was terrible .
such a waste !
lousy food .
certainly will not be back !
it could be so much better .
only had the nachos , which were n't anything special .
so nasty .
decor looks like you have time traveled to _num_ .
that was pretty lame .
beer selection is better in my house .
simply because of the view i would only go there for a drink .
service was just ok .
terrible atmosphere .
very musty , all the decorations appear to be from the early _num_ 's .
you can tell that the place is wiped down but never deep cleaned .
tasted nothing like a carolina burger should .
the chili was tasteless .
the bun was tasteless .
which i 'll gladly pay for a fresh ground beef patty .
pitiful excuse for a restaurant .
food is hit or miss -- usually , miss .
went for brunch .
food was not very good either .
no apologies for uncooked food !
it was loud - very loud - as usual .
we have kids that need to eat and are getting cranky .
it is not a family restaurant .
bad idea .
had the chicken salad and lettuce was wilted , fruit was room temp .
chicken wings where not hot .
a while later , the waitress refilled our drinks .
it just did n't add up .
i will never spend another dime here .
cheap eats yes but not high quality just typical flavor i guess .
when did simply enjoying the company of your companions fall out of favor ?
too salty to finish .
i ordered a _num_ oz .
for dessert , we shared a peanut butter pie with chocolate sauce .
her steak was over cooked and dry .
he had a replacement steak that was just the same as the first .
my steak tonight was small in size and one third of it was gristle .
the place always seems busy whether it is happy hour or sunday dinner .
the waitress was a good server so this is solely on tonight 's food .
his ribs were refrigerator cold .
i 've already taken the meal off . ''
at that time my husband said he chicken was really good .
cold brownie .
only came back once to fill our drinks .
will not be back .
after all that , the treatment didnt work at all .
however the facility has also been very accommodating when we needed .
ok for _num_ night stay .
couple running it were very friendly .
biggest peeve is grass not kept .
horrible management and pizza .
the fries were horrible .
i had deep fried batter for lunch !
someone else brought us water tho .
nothing much to it at all .
the taste was mediocre .
would not go hear again .
and they taste like cooking oil .
friendly wait staff .
cheese curds , i 've had better .
this is a store that could really use a face lift .
not impressed .
seems dated .
produce could use a makeover .
can we please have a new grocery store already ?
the prices , however , are my biggest beef .
a _num_ oz .
... hey , how about you just lower your frickin ' prices ?
do n't bother !
oh , wait .
just about half the price of the `` promotion '' the representative offered me .
transfer _num_ , to sales !
transfer _num_ , to the internet !
transfer _num_ , to the phone representative ( again ) !
transfer _num_ , to sales ( again ) !
Neutral
it 's not theirs to make sure it work .
needs more books and homeless people .
sides of hot baked potato and basic iceberg lettuce salad were fine .
waitress amber was courteous and attentive .
mediocre at best .
it was horrible .
he requested his money back .
nothing here .
service was terrible !
people walked in after us and were seated .
i will not be back .
nasty & dirty .
the place is full of regulars drinking cheap beer .
then someone came over and said hi .
she was rude and careless .
we walked inside to the bar where the bartenders were a lot better .
there were n't many patrons in the dining room .
ate there last night with a group of friends .
service is slow .
wait staff is not trained .
cheap bar food .
no one was there .
tried this because it 's local .
terrible , bland chinese food .
not much else to say .
no offer of a refund .
no sincere apology .
i was wrong .
the wait staff were completely absent outside of delivering the food .
the chicken egg drop soup was oddly sweet .
the calamari was not tough .
i 'm sorry .
dry and flavorless .
they refilled our glasses only once , after we had asked for the check .
we ended up tipping and not making a fuss ... just another lesson learned .
the egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer .
pot stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good .
for hours - over two to be exact .
i do not recommend this place .
disappointing .
old , old fruit for my garnish in my drink .
just very weird .
no , no .
the only nice thing about this place is the ambiance .
she was hesitant to give me a straight up answer .
she said ummm not really !
she needs more training in customer service .
ate here once with a buy one , get one coupon .
if you go when it 's busy , beware .
he said no problem .
i 'm eating very slowly because i want that hot sauce .
bottom line , drinks : yay !
it was a certified used vehicle so it was still under warranty .
excuse me ?
it is $ _num_ just to walk in the door .
_num_ - the locker rooms are old and sort of creepy .
you probably are n't either .
am i going to stop going there as a result ?
Positive
which i guess explains the attitudes of the staff .
horrible , horrible , horrible service .
they staff is friendly enough , but they are still a service biased company .
went there on saturday night to get some food to go .
very little selection .
some of the food on the buffet is quite good .
no thanks .
worst place ever !
disappointed .
hire another cook and install another stove .
only takes cash or check !
ugh .
i ordered the thai curry noodles .
not impressed .
my vegetables were obviously charred and they still sent me the dish .
almost thought i was in los angeles again .
i would suggest that there must be a better choice in madison .
i am sure there are asians in madison .
for the most part , i 've had ok experiences with the food selections .
it 's nothing really special .
i ordered a shrimp and veggie stir fry to go .
yeah , next time i 'll get my own lunch .
it fell short in ambiance and flavor for me .
it was awkward .
after cream cheese wontons , pad thai is one of my favorite asian entrees .
my last fortune cookie said i 'll probably return to chin 's .
on their menu it says $ _num_ minimum .
terrible customer service !
not very friendly to start .
i will not be back .
poorly run .
panda is doing better then this .
no sweet , no sour .
not so freshly made !
fairly basic .
the service is less than stellar .
maybe it is just me , but i think it 's overrated .
* flavor - the ice cream here is too sweet .
i do n't recommend going there .
it looks like the floors and base boards have not cleaning in months .
one was apple pie and the other was cheesecake .
darts , pool , tuesday blues night ( live blues band !
rude .
so much for being a loyal customer .
unfortunately we choose cousins .
poor customer service .
the nose was off , and so was the taste .
they have decent drink specials .
ive never had their food but ive heard its pretty decent .
overall it an ok place to go to get a few drinks .
maybe they only serve locals .
there were n't remotely interested in us or our business .
wednesday night , september _num_ , _num_ .
sunday morning , was looking forward to a bloody mary .
was n't even busy , one bartender was standing around doing nothing .
i was really excited to come here and usually really like cajun food .
yelpers , you let me down !
when i poured onto my salad it was just drenched in oil .
i only ate the shrimp .
ugh .
then , it was an even longer wait to order dinner .
there was no bam !
completely disgusting !
the hotel was totally booked .
lesson learned for next time .
unacceptable !
service was terrible .
horrible !
it 's hard to believe this is a marriott property .
all of the power in the room was then knocked out .
which is n't enough .
seriously , you really expect people to use these pieces of junk ?
bedding was stained on pillow and comforter .
not acceptable .
platinum member service my butt .
eventually one of them fell ... .
this marriott kind of feels like an airport hotel .
and i 've been marriott platinum for _num_ years !
terrible value .
this place should be like $ _num_ a night .
first night not so great .
cold showers two morning 's in a row .
it is loud and noisy , seems like lots of kids running around .
more than one occasion they came before the agreed upon time .
i just gave up .
the coin operated laundry was another in consistent experience .
chocolate chip , peanut butter , sugar ?
: ( disappointing .
i like my croissants light , buttery , and flakey .
i responded back to the email and never received and sort of follow up .
disappointing .
this is very misleading .
the alarm clock was off by almost a half hour .
i stayed at the hilton garden inn the friday night before my wedding .
walls are thin .
do not stay here .
very disappointed .
the pizza is what you expect , nothing better than ok .
that sucks .
gross !
you could have fooled me .
that was disappointing .
nothing to write home about .
so , better pizza ?
are you kidding me ?
sorry papa john .
i checked with them if they deliver and they said yes .
sandwiches come with chips , not fries .
if not , plan on spending about three times too much there .
the scene reminds me of ... a garage .
as one of the reviewers mentioned the breakfast was very oily .
taste was just ok.
the pancakes were pretty tasty , though .
service was super slow .
the moment i walked in i regretted it immediately .
the eggs were under done but the toast was fine .
walked in and got an app .
she took off about _num_ inches made me look like a five year old .
the worst .
not cool .
on another note , the people at fedex were pretty nice .
cheap food , but everything fried on a friday tastes like fish .
i do n't know prices .
terrible .
overall , _num_ stars .
was fairly busy but not packed .
was told it would n't be long .
menu was extremely limited .
the third possible main dish was trout and i forget the fourth .
trust me , this place is a bust .
a drive thru is suppose a little quicker service of getting your food .
the waitress was poor .
some pieces were way over cooked .
big mistake .
the food was awful .
ca n't justify going back ... .
kitchen does not care .
i run several companies and have never run into to this .
i selected overnight shipping because i really needed them the next day .
the meh : the hushpuppies were 1/2 way decent , but nothing extraordinary .
i 'm going to have to revisit in the near future to investigate .
so disappointed .
the food is n't fresh .
atmosphere was awful .
my experiences in this store have not been good for some years now .
_num_ .
nobody greets you when you walk in .
( customer service _num_ ) .
_num_ .
_num_ .
disgusting .
you are a mess !
an absolute mess .
this place needs an iron fist .
the buffalo wings were greasy and actually not hot when we got them .
tonight 's offering was a step above cafeteria chicken strips .
with chicken , it cost $ _num_ .
no no no .
it was scary pink and super soft -- like raw hamburger generally is .
i 'm not .
the food is so-so at best .
gave us free drinks , and coupons .
this place is usually a fave but the recently its been not so good .
it took our party of _num_ two hours to get our food .
all we ordered was hamburgers and chicken sandwiches .
i am going to do my car at home from now on .
had i known , i would certainly made a reservation .
cons : too pricey & ala carte .
unbelievably disappointed .
i 'm in town for business , and went on a week night .
the bread i wish were warm .
not going back .
we were very disappointed .
hit or miss .
mostly miss actually .
we were not too impressed .
ick .
maybe i 'm just bitter .
cold .
we all got the fish fry plus some deep fried shrimp .
terrible service .
i do n't recommend .
bad experience .
this place is awful .
rubber greasy curds .
stopped in for breakfast on sunday .
how hard is it to screw up breakfast ?
not again .
stopped here for the 1st ( & last ) time around 1:30 friday afternoon .
six of us went here for friday night fish .
the salad bar is not beautiful as was described by another reviewer .
it could stand a few updates .
there is limited table space in the bar in general .
ordered a chicken quesadilla for an app which was really good .
menu is typical bar food .
she was really busy and she looked surprised we needed the check .
she was busy and nice ... still just took along time .
did someone over rate this place ?
c 's is just a greasy spoon .
needless to say one guy was outside and one inside .
crappy customer service .
worst service ever .
terrible customer service .
the door locks are a joke .
they are not military friendly at all , they claim to be .
the bruce company is very , very expensive .
yes , i was a little stressed .
fail .
_num_ ) the plants this past summer were infested .
disgusting .
so i left .
i 've been a bruce co customer for well over a decade .
excuse me ?
no apologies .
rating is really _num_ and based upon the beers sampled .
at least _num_ in one room of the tour .
the beer garden was out of the most popular styles .
maybe they deserve _num_ stars .
we just picked up a custom cake for a colleague 's going away .
he showed me the old one and it was black as night .
i would never rent here again .
or maybe just feel like it .
my expectations were not that high .
slow service .
absolutely unreasonable .
this bk needs better management and training for the employees .
avoid at all costs !
terrible service !
not acceptable !
not even worth one star !
i went through the drive through , with about _num_ cars ahead of me .
does n't matter what you order , be prepared to wait .
this place is a hole .
awesome !
worst bk ever .
avoid !
the chicken nuggets and sandwiches are also passable .
literally on even one croutons or slice of tomato nothing but shredded lettuce .
i do n't mind having someone answer and then immediately put me on hold .
thumbs down .
never , ever go here .
doing some food prep for my job , i called bs on her .
so slow .
instead of offering napkins the girl just shut the window & turned around .
horrible service .
taco bell back then only existed in south western states .
plus , they never get it right .
worst taco bell ever !
horrible place & service .
ordered egg rolls , steamed dumplings , garlic beef and orange chicken .
tasted low quality .
food was just low quality .
so , i stand and wait .
not saying they had to immediately hand me my order , but come on !
not overly impressed .
do n't bother .
it 's just not worth it .
gross .
no excuse for dirty .
the waitress was really nice , i think her name was sarah .
i 'm not joking .
too little too late .
unbelievable and with my little girl there .
disgusting ... .
any other kfc would be better .
)
finally , after my pushing , she looked it up on my file .
i 'll buy my product there from now on .
the selection was slim to non .
so probably expecting too much .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
just be very cautious when dealing with this dr .
avoid this place .
dont hire these people .
i worked at a walmart pharmacy years ago , as a technician .
as with any retail business , employees come and go rather quickly .
it 's completely hit or miss with customer service .
let me break it down for ya .
hide the powdered doughnuts . ''
donuts sucked .
sausage and scrambled egg were okay .
cakes were n't good .
they were in bloody hurry always though it was just a brunch going on .
whatever the reason , this has not been an enjoyable experience .
the cheddar tasted sweet ( i know , weird , right ? )
disappointed .
clean , noisy room .
very poor breakfast .
coffee horrible .
grey is grey and pink is pink .
even into high school in the 90s i continued to shop here happily .
i 'd even like to give you _num_ stars for effort .
horrible .
it is difficult to even find one .
then i did it , i made an appointment .
evening , busy time .
apparently another appointment was waiting .
i do not know , i do not know .
all in all , i 'd pass on this store .
we are shopping on amazon tonight .
nope .
not going to spend money here again .
it was not appealing to me .
very bland and overcooked .
just terrible .
avoid .
only rice and onions .
especially if they request them !
ordered the mongolian beef combo and fried dumplings .
the food was nasty .
beef curry was okay .
the staff sucks beyond rude .
should n't be in business .
the nut job lady in the morning needs to be on meds .
three times ive been in and every time they are under staffed .
tonight i ordered the chimichangas .
instead of one big one , you get two smaller ones .
they also offer flautas , i wonder if they 're just the same thing .
they never check my online order !
not worth the time !
it was horrible !
fried rice included soy sauce and carrots only !
no flavor .
the chicken dishes had fat on the meat .
i had tofu mixed vegetables , which is my go-to .
just no .
i ordered takeout from here tonight .
in my phoenix and dragon i had five `` jumbo '' shrimps .
which are really just average sized shrimp .
_num_ minute mark rolls around and we have n't gotten a call .
the driver apologized and it was still hot .
the food was so dry .
no taste .
no flavor .
so bland .
disgusting !
bad business , bad service .
the food was very meh ... _num_ people dined .
not too thrilled with the value of a groupon from sports pub .
that was not the case .
they have one cash register at the front of the store .
nothing more , nothing else .
the food is inconsistent .
it does n't matter the time of day .
i ordered sausage croissant meal w coffee to go .
sigh .
running out of fries ?
looked online and saw it opens at _num_ am on weekdays .
the old kind .
never eaten here .
cash only and they 're out of fries .
madison public health department had burger king hire a pest control company .
so bizarre .
_num_ .
this is typical of the service .
_num_ .
horrible customer service .
continued doing nothing .
she was a counter waiting to get cut .
much better burgers and sandwiches in madison for a much more reasonable price .
staff was friendly and service was fairly prompt .
overall , the place tries too hard with its theme .
not a day to encourage diners to eat on the patio .
there were a handful of patrons ( certainly more staff than paying customers ) .
disgusting !
cheeseburger was not all that .
it was disgusting .
it was acceptable , but the taste was off .
the service was n't good either .
i will not be back .
if you are still reading ... .
i had the mini crab burgers and they were pretty good .
service was mediocre .
however , i was surprised by the reasonable beer selection and the nice menu .
the big problem with cheeseburger was the service .
i got the guacamole bacon burger .
it was horrible .
portions are weak however .
a big mac would probably be as flavorful as the burgers served here .
second , i never got a refill on my soda .
i will not be coming back .
i 'm just beyond put off .
nobody was cleaning up the place !
our food was barely edible .
so the food was average , not great .
not worth the price .
disappointing .
however , the dishes we got were n't particularly good either .
skip this place .
disgusting !
pretty unfortunate event ... .
going to file a police report .
pet friendly and low cost .
it 's ok for low cost , but keep your expectations low .
it was absolutely gross .
we stayed here for _num_ nights this weekend .
our bathroom was disgusting .
do not stay here .
no idea !
it certainly was n't clean though .
i 'm beyond upset with red roof inn , madison .
please do not stay here .
she did n't seem to care .
odd smell .
very disappointed .
doubt i 'll be back .
poor food handling practices !
i was really excited to try this place as the reviews were excellent .
major disappointment !
last i checked , those practices could send someone to the hospital !
we will not be going back !
let 's begin with the parking situation .
i think i am going to stick to that for this venue as well .
why make people wait outside for an hour or more to attend an event .
$ _num_ for a double ?
i needed new glasses , so prescription in hand i went shopping for frames .
not quite .
will not use them again .
Neutral
i returned a car today at hertz at the madison airport .
edit - the less expensive store was the highly rated park street location .
pain in the neck , right ?
the tech put the bulb in and apparently it blew almost instantly .
_num_ .
_num_ .
that 's just not right .
stayed on a business trip seeking to save money on the nightly rate .
my room was dirty .
ugh .
my blanket has burn holes in it .
Neutral
negative stars .
the service , however , needs help , literally .
everyone was working hard , they just need more people !
we drank too much coffee with all this waiting .
horrible service .
$ _num_ off our bill .
manager is very inexperienced .
fix your wifi for _num_ stars .
the jambalaya and gumbo seemed blah to both of us .
take a bite , and all you taste is bread .
cornbread was dense and moist ?
flavorless though .
but not spectacular .
cashier was not friendly at all .
after trying several times , we requested a third room .
extremely disappointed .
Very negative
does anyone in madison consider this a great mexican food location ?
_num_ .
friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas .
_num_ .
that is , your cheesy , americanized mexican food experience .
tamales were not good .
the west side location was way better .
half the time i 'm there they screw up my order .
avoid this place .
the food is microwaved and tastes like it came out of a box .
terrible service !
it 's like mexican food for people who do n't like mexican food .
so try the table guac , but give the shrimp wrap a pass .
the decor is _num_ 's `` americanized mexico . ''
nothing too exciting .
badger game disappointment !
tonight was a completely different story !
it needed spice though .
bad service .
waiter was rude and obnoxious .
the chimichangas were on point though .
i will not go back .
terrible customer service .
avoid .
_num_ big tv 's to watch the game .
some free food and i believe they had $ _num_ pints .
it 's not this place .
never going here again .
it did n't taste fresh .
oh and the tortillas and butter are n't free anymore , btw .
no more chances .
ordered baked fish for $ _num_ .
smallest portion of fish i 've ever had at a fish fry .
i 'm still thirsty just thinking about it .
nothing surprising here .
the restroom was gross .
as the yelp _num_ star rating says : meh .
the coffee was pretty good and the service was decent if not overwhelming .
i got some weird dish with hash browns in my pancakes and scrambled eggs .
this place is awful .
so i guess there 's that .
it had more salt than you 'd find in food at mcdonalds .
the meat in the pot roast tasted processed .
the dumplings were slimy .
food was horrible .
service was mediocre .
atmosphere was alright .
disgusting .
come in here quite a bit by myself , usually later in the evenings .
not going back .
not always reliable .
i would sooner walk everywhere then ever deal with this place again .
first , the sandwich was exceptionally greasy .
you 've got to be desperate to eat there .
i could n't even eat it .
what a waste !
just like every other home depot .
i stayed here with my fiance for a night a couple of saturdays ago .
not a good thing .
so overall , easy to make a better choice anywhere else .
one push on my wheelchair and i was across the room .
not to worry .
so the highlight of the room comes when u r passed out and asleep .
the cleaning staff kept leaving their cleaning supplies in my room .
the atmosphere is typical of the chain , and kept clean enough .
the only downside was the waiter .
huge mistake .
the `` bottomless '' salad never had an offer of a refill .
rarely are there any baskets for shoppers to use .
and they are frequently out of things they normally carry .
they 're terrible .
something about this location just seems off .
my latest trip sealed the deal .
so , so long .
not okay .
my boyfriend drops off my bike on a monday .
the also say they 're going to lube the brake lines .
my flat is fixed .
$ _num_ dollars .
not exactly an upscale mall by a long shot .
just ... nothing .
hmm , this mall needs a facelift .
the stores are awful .
a pedi place and a foot massage place next door to one another ?
not so much anymore .
`` ummmm , what kinds are there ? ''
then , you drive around , then , you pull up like normal .
awkward and offensive .
i just got this car _num_ weeks ago !
the employees are rude .
the product is over priced .
the people are rude !
this needs no explanation .
terrible !
wasted $ _num_ .
did get a coupon for a return visit .
the minute i walked thru the door ... .
i do n't get it .
after i walk in , the bar area was filled , restaurant portion wasnt .
i grabbed a piece of chicken out to try and it was completely cold !
i ate what i could then went to bed shortly after .
it was terrible .
my husband and i went in to attempt to have lunch .
my wife had to get up and get some from the host .
not just one but two employees .
dirty as all hell .
and yes someone can contact me if they 'd like .
i 've never been more dissatisfied with such customer service .
it was that bad .
very disappointed .
i wish they would go back to the old style of burgers .
this hotel is disgusting .
really disappointed .
this last stay of _num_ nights was a different story .
the bed was comfortable .
it 's horrible .
let me wet it down . ''
do not go to this place .
do n't lie to customers .
not good .
where i wanted it to go down , it goes up .
where i wanted it to go up , it goes down .
they post hours til _num_ am on weekends but are rarely open past _num_ .
if it happened to us twice , surely it 's happened to someone else .
gross !
i assume somebody got there late .
there is another taco bell down east washington .
the workers also gave me an extra fountain drink .
honestly so annoying .
my boyfriend and i visited for the first time ever on thursday .
even the salads are iffy .
their food is nothing special .
the food was bland .
that was frustrating .
the cheddar biscuits were heavily salted , almost to much to handle .
first and probably last time i dine at this red lobster location .
came in at dinner time and it was quite busy .
even the cooks messed up the steak order at the table next to us .
i 'll make that drive next time i need my lobster fix .
_num_ star for the salty biscuits is a 1/2 star too much .
i ate here with my wife recently .
no big deal .
i told the server and he promptly brought out a different house salad .
everyone has off days , i get it .
service was slow .
i would n't eat here again .
oh dear , you guys ... .
block is just awful !
horrible in fact !
we were wrong !
not going back .
went for lunch had the fish fry .
i so wanted to like this place .
pros : the beer , casual atmosphere , and garlic chile fries .
so not a good first experience .
is there a broccoli shortage ?
i got _num_ thinly sliced pieces .
maybe _num_ sticks .
such a contrast to the sleeping counter person .
i really miss the west side location , they were on top of it .
in the past _num_ weeks i have been here _num_ times .
terrible customer service !
we will not be back !
i will never be going back .
mind you , it was 4:30 p.m. on a monday .
i asked what time they close tomorrow , he said , `` 8:30 '' .
before leaving , i checked their website .
do n't say you are returning a gift .
significantly peeling off the walls .
i could go on , but i 'm sure you get the point .
get your wallet out !
i buy a room for a night and a conference room for a day .
this hotel really sticks it to their priceline customers .
just stayed here for one night and it was passable .
gross hotel !
nasty carpeting .
very old furniture .
horrible experience .
she replied that she would call downstairs to send someone up .
there are six pieces of fruit put out on the front desk each morning .
you 've been warned .
used hotwire to find a last minute deal when traveling through madison .
the room was pretty rough .
the bed had clearly seen better days .
the room had big stains on carpet .
simply awful .
old , needs remodeling .
really disappointed .
apparently ac only works if light is on and you move around .
did n't get it .
horrible service .
but as you may know , bigger is not necessarily better .
a little salt and pepper would help a lot .
the bar itself is a pretty typical wisconsin dive bar .
tell me what i need , tell me how to care for things .
service was atrocious .
not cool .
two adults and one kid equals a _num_ dollar meal .
the service was horrible .
out of a can , bag , box , or freezer .
parking is very limited .
not a fan .
i was seated and given a menu , and that is where it ended .
cause she saw the mean looks on our faces .
the manager should be fired as well as the entire staff .
only 2-3 tables were being used .
food is poor quality .
service is terrible !
Neutral
horrible service !
would not come back here .
if you have a pet , go stay at a super _num_ .
poor quality ; _num_ .
stale .
then there 's the deli , where there 's been a few issues .
this particular deli meat however , was a few steps beyond .
however , he did so without gloves & without washing his hands .
service ... not so good .
food ... not so good .
they also had a salad bar that accompanied the fish fry .
waitress nowhere to be found .
waitress was clueless .
she made me feel rushed and took away from the moment .
zero customer appreciation !
she 's the professional that was hired because she said she could do it .
stopped in because i was nearby and did a search for close coffee shops .
i will never be back .
somebody teach these people some customer service .
a companion ordered a plain cheeseburger and it was loaded with onions .
cooking school _num_ will tell you the bun will fall apart .
its not amazing food .
gross , disgusting , rip-off .
not happy and not coming back .
gross .
milk , ice cream , caramel ?
wait ... did they just charge me like that much for this ?
there 's tons of better restaurants in the area and in the city .
the service is less than desirable .
last friday i went there for another shake and it was really thin .
it seemed totally chaotic and like nobody was in charge .
will not be back .
the host was friendly and despite being busy , they sat us quickly .
i ordered chicken pot pie with mashed potatoes .
both of which were really dry .
eggs where overlooked .
it 's all fine , but not special at all .
my friend had the zucchini potatoes pancakes which were incredible .
however she still charged me for my coffee ... .
wow , _num_ stars ?
terrible service .
actually no service .

_num_ .
the salesperson said i could pick from any four .
it was weird .

nothing happened to it .
but she needed a person from paint to approve it .
_num_ .
it was ridiculous .
the garden department is rather large as is my list .
hey , i get it .
stopped in here after breakfast at denny 's next door .
walked through the store to the service desk .
no krispy kreme .
no dunkin donuts .
yelp and the restaurant itself states that this establishment is open until _num_ pm .
lights were out , nobody home .
i ordered the spinach with rice dish , and my husband got the gyro .
i could n't even stomach a few bites .
such a disappointment .
i have a coupon for free _num_ inch pizza when purchasing _num_ inch pizza .
boo shame on them .
i ordered a stuffed ( pie ) pizza for carryout .
not a fan .
big mistake .
very messy and started to come off very quickly .
ur losing customers !
do the employee 's working here know how to stock the shelves ?
not everyone has a _num_ lb dog .
such obvious bs .
but this has been my experience .
ever since caf royale took over the scene , the coffee is not fantastic .
not impressed .
horrible service .
unacceptable .
can not believe it !
the motor had a leak and was covered under warranty .
i would not recommend .
terrible service .
i recently had my engagement pictures here .
ok still , we can hurry .
and my photographer stayed to take pics with my ring .
she needs a crash course on customer service .
bc she has zero .
grease running down my hand .
[ cue the tim & eric `` ya blew it ! ''
big mistake !
that was n't much better .
i was utterly wrong .
it tasted fishy and disgusting !
not a fan .
have not had lunch or dinner here .
my wife and ate there tonight .
service not good .
what a disappointment !
salty , doughy breadsticks .
chicken parmesan .
i left full , but i can get full at mcdonald 's too .
she only knew i couldnt do a saturday evening .
our main complaint was that it was hot in the restaurant .
it did n't start well .
he just crowded the plates onto the table while we scrambled to make room .
i tasted it , and yup , tasted just like it looked .
i do not recommend this place .
they are charging for hot tea and pepper oil .
i would not eat there again .
second bite into my chicken , and it 's hard .
no fortune .
disappointment .
awful dirty place .
never again , goodyear !
terrible service .
do n't count on the people in this store to give you complete information .
i went back the next day and was served by rebecca .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
my iphone is _num_ 1/2 years old and was turning off on me constantly .
mr. roberts has going for it .
drinks are reasonably priced too .
worst worst worst !
i felt so embarrassed .
quit going there .
and this lady was rough .
i would not recommend going here .
our bill was completely off .
however , we only got a refill on the water when the check came .
if this is a concern for you , consider a different restaurant .
starters were about $ _num_ and entrees were less than $ _num_ .
no longer dog friendly .
too bad for them !
i live _num_ blocks from the tip top .
cash only really sucks .
everything was dry .
you 've been warned .
beer selection is ok.
i was of age but not planning on drinking .
_num_ thumbs down .
extremely slow drink service .
and i 'm not twelve .
drinks way over priced !
it was shady business .
there was a better way to express their concerns , if they were legitimate .
( that almost never happens ) just be careful and shop around .
where was the call before i dropped of as promised !
waste of my time .
customer service is second to none .
and there has n't been much info .
communication was poor .
never had any kind of follow up call to see whether we were happy .
ordering over the phone , everything seemed to go well .
she refunds me around _num_ bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge .
so i come back and begin with the ribs , 1/2 a slab .
the fries dipped in the bbq sauce were the best part by far .
was driving by madison and thought we 'd get some bbq .
i waited _num_ minutes .
but at least i know she put my ticket into the kitchen .
unfortunately , i was disappointed .
the salad was just bagged romaine lettuce with dressing in a packet .
nothing could be farther from the truth !
and then again for game _num_ of the world series .
the service has n't gotten any better here .
we did find parking on a side street , but not real convenient .
the ribs are over cooked .
if you like bbq sauce , then this may be your spot .
i 'm still searching for good bbq meat in madison .
very frustrating experience .
every customer had a problem with their food or order .
never again ... .
mediocre , really .
horrible customer service !
not going back .
i 'll try again , but will more than likely dine-in and not drive-thru .
no way .
we have been buying our dog food from here for years .
worst place ever !
my oldest died so i wanted to buy a kitten there .
having said all this , my opinion of this store changed as of today .
i went into their store to get some dog food .
never again will i visit this store .
my previous review was for an oil change , which i still stand by .
brought it by that morning and explained the brake problem i was experiencing .
i just need a quote because i am shopping around .
this place is horrible .
if you want spinach pie , go to med cafe .
we had coffee , the sausage skillet , and the southern benedict .
food was terrible .
i will not be coming back .
they have an acoustics problem here .
i later called panera and spoke with the manager dennis .
consider yourself warned .
this location needs new management and new employees .
always slow service .
staff never in a hurry .
nothing special to write about .
would not return to this one .
associate was helpful .
the rest of the experience , not so much .
the chair still has problems .
there was never any follow up from the madison store .
well , it has n't gotten any better .
there was a big saturday sale going on .
they quoted the exact chair for $ _num_ .
i booked everything online and called to confirm .
next month i will be renting from any other company besides enterprise .
this is unfortunate .
it kind of explains why nobody comes here .
worst service ever .
the menu was extremely old , small and the coffee was pure water .
i order the walleye , hash browns , toast and eggs breakfast .
biscuit , gravy and hash browns ?
i was there on a hot sat in june .
that is ridiculous .
served with about _num_ french fries .
are you kidding me ?
$ _num_ for a milkshake ?
the hot dog was hot and the chili was warm .
i like that they have shredded cheese on it , rather than liquid cheese .
_num_ - my dining companion got a burger .
he also ordered cheese curds with it .
not good .
not even worth the price !
disturbing to say the least .
it was not .
Positive
Negative
deserves zero stars .
worst customer service .
customer service is awful .
that quickly turned into an hour and a half .
literally these are the words we just exchanged after getting home .
terrible .
when we got there nobody was there .
extremely disappointed .
not tonight .
for tonight , the feast of the dollars is upon us .
i asked again , and he had to go get his manager ?
i was looking for a bath mat , a fan and some groceries .
the lighting was dim and very difficult to find what i needed .
i could n't believe it .
very disappointed .
i am a frequent walmart shopper .
was sent by one walmart to this walmart for the last of a product .
i grab another employee .
the money just seems to be needed to drive business i guess .
ordering the tires was ok .
i 've been using priceline for _num_ years almost on a weekly basis .
my room is next to the elevator too .
this was neither .
really disappointed .
i walked in and there was a white lady getting her bike fixed .
the guy working there looked past me and serviced the white lady before me !
i patiently waiting thinking something was strange .
he then asked me what i needed .
he just left me standing there .
he thanked me for my patience and went along .
i mean , oil was literally dripping out of the crust .
gross .
first time great and reasonably priced for fries , boneless buffalo wings and dips .
no , really .
but just ... just get it together , dude .
do i need an artisan barbecue glaze on my crust ?
julie was the consultant who helped me .
i then signed and returned with a _num_ % down payment .
not cool .
they are like , it is just brownies .
he ordered a turtle pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard .
more like gross .
and just walked away .
Neutral
this dq does not even deserve _num_ star .
no follow up .
gross .
tried it , it was discussing .
waste of $ _num_ .
however it is always a hit or miss .
not pink or even a smoke ring , blood .
not cool .
ate here last night .
never going back .
this place is in need of some serious updating in all areas .
this is not a good thing .
not a lot of great variety .
i had the 1/2 rack of ribs with slaw and fries .
the slaw and fries were fine .
the ribs , on the other hand , could use some work .
one rib was fall of bone .
further down , it was closer to jerky .
all in all , not a great bbq experience .
barely ok.
service was flat out terrible .
the ribs were very dry and tough .
will not be going back .
the cook said that happens sometimes and sent out two cold pieces of rib .
the breast was dry .
next i tried the ribs .
the baked beans were pretty good .
the coleslaw is what hurt .
bottom line is i 've had better bbq in the madison area .
we decided on the tuesday special - all you can eat chicken and ribs .
what a disappointment .
i would not recommend fat jacks .
service was 3-4 stars but food was a _num_ stars .
however the the fried mushrooms were good .
better service , friendlier doctors , the list goes on .
most likely between _num_ and _num_ stars .
my quesadilla was a bean taco , yup definitely not a quesadilla .
the refried beans look like they have an artificial light purple color to them .
service was slow and unprofessional .
so bizarre !
farm and fleet or fleet farm is my only go to now !
worst customer service ever !
_num_ minutes before closing .
horrible .
worst starbucks experience .
( not cheaper ) .
wrong !
it 's all garbage .
the only semi good brand is sassy cow and again , guess what ?
more than six dollars per container !
they scream about being local but they really dont partner with local businesses .
i just wonder how often this happens .
and be sure to check the prices at the register !
horrid meat !
_num_ ) the portions are small on every sandwich that we ordered .
have some standards , arby 's .
horrible service .
false advertising .
i know that french fries are not usually made in individual orders .
ridiculous .
visited for the first time on friday , july _num_ .
disgusting .
bad service and unfriendly staff .
horrible service !
i was excited to work with carl at my tasting .
disappointing cakes .
fake rum , maybe ?
it was totally disgusting .
so carl , just a word of advice .
it 's okay , i guess .
the phone was answered and i simply asked : do you carry time magazine ?
no good bye .
if she was busy she could have said that .
she says she does not know .
that is my whole experience trying to find a magazine .
its decor is horrible .
it 's pricing itself out of madison .
the other _num_ stations were dusty .
they gave me a discount price of $ _num_ .
i was wrong .
i was very wrong !
they were not exciting .
that waitress needs _num_ things : some training and an order pad .
awful service , rude bartenders .
i tip well but yeah ... they might get a penny .
service sucked .
he was not at all apologetic .
i am looking elsewhere .
they really deserve a _num_ so i rounded down .
not a true butcher either .
this kfc never has the chicken you want ready .
lame .
the service was slow .
even the coleslaw was very dry .
potato wedges : awful .
zero stars .
this particular bucks seems to be hit or miss .
the crust is incredibly thin .
their sizes are not generously portioned out .
nothing stood out to me .
i appreciated that they put the pizza in the paper bags .
not understanding the good reviews here .
their pizza is gross .
with so many choices , i simply ca n't consider this one again .
ate here twice .
maybe that 's why i only had three bites .
there saving grace is their hot sour soup .
this is not the place i recommend .
how about you do n't nickel and dime your customers .
horrible .
i 've been down south and had amazing sausage gravy .
i 'm not going back .
it is just your local breakfast place with food options under $ _num_ .
it was a plain ham and cheese omelette .
this restaurant reminds me of cute little hole in the wall breakfast places .
not anymore .
my husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger and i had the veggie benedict .
also the coffee was not good .
late night madison is tough when you are hungry .
dining room is a little dingy for a chain .
hamburgers , fries , soda and of course a frosty .
unlimited fries with every sandwich ?
we were seated promptly and our drink order was taken .
someone by the name of justin apologized , who was he ?
they could have put them back on our card 's .
but my low point is for the service .
$ _num_ for a meh burger ?
Neutral
nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city .
from the moment we walked in , this place felt different .
no big deal .
not many customers at the time .
anyway , the rating is for the food .
i really was hoping for good food not money off of our order .
wine or beer ?
no way .
i 've made better wine .
in the end , they were shitty wines , and it a shitty experience .
the only way its worth the money is going all day .
she also stated everything was in stock .
i could not believe it .
truly sad .
no respect .
he did not care .
still terrible .
not worth anything .
gross .
bathroom was disgusting .
no paper towels .
plates and bowls ( all of them ) were chipped .
not sanitary .
very disappointing .
unacceptable and disgusting .
order was taken right away and served promptly .
there were people at one other table and i believe _num_ people on staff .
i was very insulted .
i even tried a salad in an attempt to find something healthy .
i 'll keep trying , though .
boring .
it has a vanilla custard base with waffle cones and chocolate pieces in it .
boring .
the blueberries are really hard and frozen .
i really like the donut , the pie , just everything .
i wish i had taken pictures of my visit today .
a _num_ year old electric stove ( $ _num_ ) .
there goes $ _num_ .
customer service was pitiful .
avoid this place .
after three attempts , we finally rode out the wait for the fish fry .
that seems to be the draw of this dumpy little joint .
the restaurant equivalent of flying coach .
it was not good .
walked in on a busy fish fry night for the first time .
horrible service !
crappy food !
we put in our order for _num_ entrees and an appetizer .
was really excited to try their fish fry after hearing many raves .
so i get the bartender and explain the story .
1st time and as i say one and done .
yeah , long story short ... .
the food sucked ass .
the lady at the front desk tells me i 'll owe $ _num_ .
the little asian dentist comes in and once again ( surprise ! )
absolutely ridiculous .
absolutely ridiculous .
not cool .
no accommodations were offered .
and only then if there is nothing else going on .
this place is awful .
places like this should be using mystery shoppers to test and improve their service .
it was not good .
it was not bad .
my chicken sandwich was pretty basic california chicken .
it came smothered in some sort of spread .
my sandwich felt apart immediately .
ugh .
people seem to like their pizza , so maybe go with that .
no way .
gross .
marginal service levels .
when the occasion calls for it i upgrade to a purse .
but this time it created a problem .
another patron complimented me on the points i made to tom , the manager .
everything else started during the _num_ o'clock hour .
just check it ?
lame .
wrong .
it 's just bad .
horrible , horrible service .
horrible .
i do n't suggest coming here for a good time .
walked in and had to wait for the hostess .
oh yea , then we had to wait for the check !
lost another customer .
under new ownership , the place is now called metro ford of madison .
beyond the cheesy exterior , he was nice .
after leaving the business office my salesman takes me over to my new ride .
so i wait an hour for the truck to be cleaned properly .
i want to know how to operate the towing package .
horrible place !
bad service !
_num_ .

not ultra modern , but contemporary design .
noisy and annoying ?
the fault of courtyard ?
not really .
no bueno !
_num_ .

Negative
negatives : it is not cheap .
but the woman who runs the restaurant with her husband blew my mind .
`` hmm ... cheap .
then she just stared at me .
the fees are reasonable and customers generally like using it .
the seaweed salad was fine and the hot sake was average .
i was very disappointed .
but i wish the sandwiches were a little bigger .
the room was fine but nothing fancy .
he has never had a problem like this .
_num_ .
_num_ .

this not a three and a half star place .
it sucks .
toilet is cracked .
staff are not nice .
they seem to loose sight of what it means to detail a car .
they wiped my interior with a wet cloth , end of story .
they talked more than detailing .
someone please teach the employees here how to better scrub the toilets .
i was wrong .
when i want to drink at a dive i want the lights dim .
it took many visits to ensure the job was done correctly .
this place is awful .
and its only _num_ dollars .
overpriced and poor quality .
totally disrespectful and horrible job !
stopped in for relaxing mani before my trip and walk out posting this !
that said , my concerns with them were on going from the get go .
it was bad .
crusty on the outside , yet dense and soft on the inside .
) .
when she did , she ordered me to wash my hands .
i was treated horribly !
the lady used old acrylic and it made my nails yellow !
gross .
there is a discount _num_ dollar bin as well .
you can also select online coupons to load to your card from the website .
incredibly depressing store .
when it was our turn he handed phone to the person .
so disappointed .
sad , sad , sad experience .
coleslaw : shredded cabbage with straight vinegar on it .
crappy fast food ?
price was not counted correctly .
i was not impressed at all !
not a place i will re visit .
the aisles are too small .
zero stars .
no help at all .
courteous service can only go so far .
so someone my girlfriend knew said that this was the place to try .
the place looked clean , service i had better too .
i guess twice was enough for me .
we had the beef steak , fried chicken , and ham and beans .
even the apple dumplings were just okay .
i would never stay here again .
we requested new sheets for _num_ rooms because of blood and other stains .
absolutely ridiculous .
only stay here if you are _num_ .
the place is dirty dirty dirty .
so i have made them a lot of money staying there .
the coffee is bad .
also , the coffee only comes in small cups .
this place is sad .
never washing his hands and never wearing gloves .
the waitress was rude .
i ordered the eggplant chicken special .
i was very excited after recently having some excellent garlic eggplant from green jade .
as it turns out , i celebrated a bit too soon .
it was american ( globe ) eggplant .
i went there again today , ordered the szechuan chicken and was very dissapointed .
never gives total over the phone .
ick .
uninspired and bland food choices .
the location of this restaurant needs to be updated .
nothing seems to stay there for long .
this is one place that really needs to go away !
it was awful !
gross man !
the okra and casserole were cold .
no big deal there .
strike _num_ .
my coke was empty .
i think this breaks a record for me .
never has it ever taken this many attempts to get it right .
probably not soon .
i 'll stick with something i normally get like fried chicken or pot roast .
i went on-line and bought the replacement parts for _num_ bucks .
not really a `` farm '' person .
i had purchased tires here a year prior to my most recent visit .
ordered one thing online and they shipped a completely different product .
avoid at all cost !
still no chairs .
supposedly they are ordered .
still nothing from the store .
no call .
no replacement furniture .
not a kid friendly location .
there is very little sauce , fairly dry cheese , and a chewy crust .
the service sucked .
i like other much cheaper pizza than this .
within a month they have messed up _num_ of our pizzas .
i would suggest picking up your order instead of delivery .
there was an additional location listed for champaign which turns out to be closer .
i 've been staying here over a month due to my job .
this has been over a month of getting breakfast .
their hours stink .
are you freakin ' kidding me ?
so one afternoon , stopped by to eat a chicken teriyaki sandwich .
inches off of my hair .
i was wrong .
she told me no .
completely incompetent staff .
_num_ classes are where learning goes to die .
never ordering from this place again .
i 'm not a snob when it comes to chinese food at all .
the biggest con , however ?
it used to be good .
i 've given this place three opportunities to _num_ .
ick .
sick .
starbucks became starbucks for a reason .
it 's just milk , dude .
the drinks , like everything else there , are overpriced for their quality .
this place is as expensive as starbucks coffee .
the only difference is at espresso royal , you get a lower quality cup .
the only day worth visiting is on wednesday because they have one dollar lattes .
terrible customer service .
rob you blind at every turn .
disgusting .
not a lot of nail salons open on sunday here .
there was a layer of acrylic dust on everything .
the place was terrible .
however , i was able to find a few suits to try on .
i only went in to grab a shirt very quickly .
we rented a truck online and had our confirmation email and receipt with us .
not helpful .
this place is awful !
terrible .
this location is weird .
this is unacceptable .
terribly slow .
terrible service .
cheap drinks .
one of your few redeeming qualities is that you have bass on tap .
hate this bar .
it gets too crowded to play darts .
it seems to be totally random .
my ears hurt more than anywhere else i 've been .
_num_ ) never enough space .
disgusting .
more like a sports bar and super crowded and not really relaxing .
also , the dj 's are inept .
_num_ ) a combination of number _num_ and _num_ .
never again stay away from this place !
the shrimp crepe only had two small pieces of shrimp .
we walked in and it was very hectic .
_num_ minutes .
slowly , our little dim sum dishes came out .
they simply served it .
i ca n't imagine why this would happen .
the owner explained that the sweet soy sauce was an extra $ _num_ .
even after they have already known you are healthy .
another issue i had is for another annual exam .
better yet , just find a different healthcare facility to go to !
for the last year and a half , my experience goes like this .
it deserves zero stars .
worst .
there is nothing redeeming about this place .
drinks are totally average , albeit cheap .
just walk by the place and be overwhelmed by the smell .
i ca n't imagine going to this place at a peak time .
this bar stinks !
came here _num_ years after my graduation ... and not much has changed .
regretted that in _num_ hours .
what an absolute dump .
one star is too much .
what a mistake .
bookstore , but lately i am so far from a fan .
after having read the reviews , i was expecting more .
there were flies all over the place .
it was `` _num_ five alarm hot sauce '' level .
ate here for the second & last time a few days ago .
very thinly sliced meat that was very chewy .
pro : none ... .
i 'm shocked that they have _num_ stars .
let me say , i strongly regret this decision .
avoid !
i wasted a trip .
ridiculous mean !
it reminds me of the frozen gyro meat you can get at grocery stores .
disappointed .
there are daily specials which is posted on the sign outside .
the fries that come with the combo is a very small portion .
additionally , they are quite stingy with the meat , i.e .
overall a little disappointing .
_num_ .
not a big fan .
also no .
this place is horrible .
we ordered the shrimp special , which was grilled and came with coconut risotto .
i hated it .
but , ok , they were short on menus .
the menu shortage ( ?
oily salmon leftovers .
we ordered some coconut shrimp , and some ravioli with goat cheese and asparagus .
i mean purple and bloody , too , not just slightly pink .
the same girl came over and was like , do you have a reservation ?
we ordered a salad , melting brie pot and lobster & crab stuffed prawns .
they came out ( four of them ) , not stuffed at all .
however , the service is so-so .
she brought the table of _num_ four slices of bread .
no way .
food was overpriced and low quality .
was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation ?
pros : the beignets were tasty and so was the sandwich .
no thank you .
disgusting !
_num_ courses .
terrible .
cheap quality .
it was impossible to chew .
this was just unacceptable .
was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation ?
they took down my review twice ... .
the staff stare like they have never seen a woman before .
disgusting .
)
; and a totally inept management of the tables .
not worth the money .
gross .
no rice .
i ordered chicken curry , the meat was spoiled and made me throw out .
will not come here ever again .
incredibly poor food quality .
i 've ordered takeout before during lunch hours and was always charge lunch price .
i had veg assorted appetizer , chicken tikka masala and naan .
so , this place is so overrated !
thumbs down !
unfortunately !
but who can turn down amazing chicken strips ?
under those conditions , i say go for it .
i was in this shop once when i was picking up my girlfriend .
i was just killing time and saw this shop .
for fast food sandwiches , i vote subway .
not very fast .
been _num_ minutes .
disappointed .
rude .
can we say gross ?
it 's not as if i had high expectations ... .
just bad .
hardly sanitary ) .
i would not recommend this restaurant .
any food would suffer from sitting for an hour .
read the bad reviews .
avoid at all cost .
in addition , it 's only steamed rice and not fried rice .
avoid at all cost .
that 's just wrong .
ground chicken is wrong .
i ate a little bit of it and was done .
lesson learned : even thai food is n't always a safe choice .
ugh .
bad customer service .
i do not recommend it !
oh god , where do i start ?
staff is rude , inconsiderate .
staff is not friendly .
i have lived in la , chicago , nyc for many years .
why not appeal to god directly ?
they stopped the upsell after that .
then , i started having performance problems with my tires .
i know they can wear early , but that is really early .
worse place in town !
very very rude staff !
spicy tuna was terrible .
it was about a _num_ inch by _num_ inch square .
what really cracked me up was the vegetables .
the food was horrible .
ugh .
menu presents typical appetizers individual cuts rolls bento boxes and dinners , again typical .
no kidding ?
not , apparently .
this place does neither .
but they put onions on every aspect of my bento box .
so we walked out .
everyone in the restaurant was waiting for his or her food .
my friend and i went there and order ramen .
this place is a joke !
same awful service .
so sad !
horrible service !
most of the frames were name brand super expensive .
so i go back to get it adjusted .
i wish i never had known about the place .
i have been there twice and both times i have not been that impressed .
it was really dry .
the fish is n't anything special either .
it was neither .
mac and cheese is awesome but small portions .
i love the okra and the collard greens .
Negative
the wait is insane .
just rude .
would not recommend this restaurant !
the champaign olive garden has declined significantly within the last year .
fridays and your applebee 's .
it was disgusting .
but now it 's not .
i ordered bruschetta and salad and my companions had soup and salad .
no apology , nothing .
not complicated to pour some sauce on the noodles !
very poor quality food .
the only bright side of this dinner was the pleasant waitress .
i could n't eat it .
extremely poor service !
alas not so good .
party of _num_ .
i did not like the sausage .
let me begin by saying that our waiter was very friendly !
i asked for meat sauce with my ravioli , i got red sauce .
i asked for a refill on my drink , never got one .
_num_ .

salad dressing very sour .

overall , there are plenty of better places for chocolates .
the menu is basically two choices : steak or chicken .
was sadly disappointed .
let me first describe the restaurant 's ambience .
when i was there the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy .
eating the steak is not a pleasant or satisfying experience .
coleslaw would be on par with that available in a chain supermarket deli .
disappointed .
worst .
Neutral
disgusting .
_num_ bucks before the tip .
the menu offers three options : ribeye , chicken , or shrimp .
the shrimp is ok , too .
i am only halfway joking .
i ordered a _num_ oz .
ribeye rare with sauted mushrooms and loaded baked potato .
so ordered the _num_ oz .
... ... ... .
maintenance is terrible !
avoid !
avoid !
horrible apartments and management .
never rent their apartment !
it 's suffering living in their apartment year round .
the worst .
can you imagine how terrified i was at that moment ?
this is rude !
lastly , my friend come to visit me in summer .
then the car get towed .
not ok.
not ok at all .
and i officially hate carrie 's now .
also , carrie is not always the most friendly shop owner .
but there are problems with other members there .
how insulting .
i shop the bulk bins because there is variety .
no thank you .
Neutral
unreal negative experience .
no apology .
no explanation .
for dry cleaning they are extremely expensive .
well , no more .
on top of it all -- they are extremely expensive .
i used the fluff and fold service _num_ times .
do n't support this business please .
well , they charged him once for $ _num_ and again for $ _num_ !
i drove down there with receipts .
very unhappy and unsatisfied customer .
as far as specialties go , i 'd say , the diner stack ?
not a fan .
however , no .
but ick .
crispy yet soft , i could 've had platters of this thing .
maybe that 's snooty , but i just hate it .
they looked me in the eye but never acknowledged my presence .
too bad .
service _num_ stars , food _num_ stars , atmosphere _num_ stars .
so terrible .
the sausage and eggs were good without complaint .
overall with the oil and salt , it was somewhat difficult to eat .
he also took my salad before i was done with .
they were so slow .
we also split a burger , which was decent , but very very heavy .
this is n't what bothers me .
at another restaurant i 'd be totally willing to forgive and forget .
i liked the fried green bean appetizer with wasabi ranch sauce quite a bit .
disappointed .
normally things here are ok - nothing fantastic .
talk about bad presentation !
needless to say , he finished it but still went home hungry .
$ _num_ for a small steak ?
bad values all around .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
i ordered some sort of pasta alfredo with chicken .
no thanks .
this place is an absolute joke .
no thanks .
this is not the case here .
thanks but no thanks .
not worth the hassle .
i took my children here while visiting my sister in champaign .
wrong .
it was nothing like it .
i was wrong .
i am not kidding .
these people are clueless .
do n't be fooled .
avoid this place !
one word nasty !
i would n't recommend it .
this was awful .
just unacceptable .
last night we went there and i got chicken tacos .
they were that bad .
as the saying goes : i 've got _num_ problems .
bad news .
worse news .
Neutral
too mad for them because , as i said , i love mexican food !
however , our server was a really nice guy .
they used yellow cheese on my tacos .
chicago is a major travel hub and the closest major city .
the fact that it is so difficult to get to hurts the university .
totally bland .
did these reviewers eat the same stuff as i did ?
probably less than $ _num_ .
you get what you pay for but the food is cheap quick and easy .
there 's an _num_ % chance that sam could be serving you .
french toast was hidden like a pancake .
* another problem we had here .
there seems to be only one cook .
another problem are the extremely small tables .
cheap .
but that is where it begins and ends .
will not be returning .
they serve the typical junk food and it is very crowded during the weekends .
they have a few specials too , so do check those out .
i was in champaign last week , on a wednesday evening .
murphy 's was the only place with their kitchen open after 10pm .
i ordered a mega bacon cheeseburger and fries .
service here was terrible .
really murphy 's ?
folks , i highly advise you to pass this place up .
_num_ stars for tradition , _num_ stars for food quality and _num_ for service .
i 'd recommend drinking here at night , but not eating .
what a shit hole !
it was almost _num_ in the afternoon and i sat at a pub table .
my point is , they have _num_ drink craftsmanship .
if i were working all night i 'd get hungry too .
eh , this place was alright .
next off , i had the burger .
so on saturday i ordered the la petit french toast .
i ended up with _num_ eggs and a bowl of plain oatmeal .
$ _num_ for spaghetti ?
then the restaurant filled up and the service was non-existent .
but frankly , next time , i 'll go to the olive garden .
i am in hopes the owners eventually make me want to return .
that just is n't possible ! ''
so then the bill comes .
then , i looked at the bill .
it 's closed !
it was disgusting .
i flag down the next passing employee , who happens to be the manager .
she said she was just checking to be sure they were there .
i prefer a crisp cold salad like most people .
however , the ring of onion on it is very hot .
overall the booth 's were simply sticky .
_num_ .
_num_ .
worst customer service ever !
also , the massage chairs suck .
okay , so i went back to give this place a second chance .
total mistake .
i 'm do n't giving this place a chance .
gross !
would never recommend to anyone else .
zero stars !
terrible service .
terrible pedicures .
so i order one of the specials , which is tofu soup and fish .
never has a restaurant left more of an impression on me .
the entire plate of nachos probably cost them $ _num_ .
apparently `` smothered '' burritos actually means fucking coated with nacho cheese .
the beef in my tacos was ground fine .
not joking .
i was starving though .
business is closed as of the end of november _num_ .
it 's always hard to get the attention of the bartenders .
beer is n't great and it 's relatively expensive for what it is .
so it fails at being a bar and sports bar .
big mistake !
maybe because it was monday night and the c team was working .
worst hooters ever !
waitress standing around .
empty tables all around .
not worth it .
maybe i 'll give it another try .
there was nothing in it .
effing gross .
it was not spicy .
it was not flavorful .
she informed me that it was carrots , onions , chicken and sauce .
rude !
the man yelled back and then hit him again .
my daughter had the pancakes with link sausage .
ordered a full order of biscuits & gravy , the meal came fairly quickly .
it was hot as well .
terrible staff .
every single item on the list was checked to be cleaned .
this lasted at least _num_ months .
do not go there !
this lady ( the owner ) had an overall rough touch .
_num_ people behind counter but i couldnt get waited on .
rude rude rude .
the warranty will be valid , just need to contact customer service .
this required me to take a day off from work to receive the bed .
it had a cheap feel to it .
there was a time _num_ years ago when la quinta was a quality brand .
not anymore .
better than most chain pizza , it 's ok .
i did not like the pizza .
slow service and bad food .
the pizza is just ok .
cheap and perfectly adequate .
the kind of place you order from because it 's close and cheap .
but the more i went , the less they seemed to want me there .
avoid at all costs !
also , the salon was a sauna !
awful , amateur job .
went there numerous times and my orders have been messed up .
i hate this mcdonalds .
i 'm not exaggerating .
i 'm dead serious .
terrible service and management .
if having fun is not your thing , check out fat city .
the second time i went was a tuesday night .
the food sucks .
)
never heard or experienced any thing like that before .
not `` chinese food '' .
just same things fried in same sauce .
they have seafood .
they only accept cash , probably because they make up prices as they go .
too old .
too old .
not a happy girl here .
would not do again .
no biggie .
unbelievable .
i scheduled an appointment , then received a call the day before the appointment .
`` we ca n't accept new contact appointments after 2pm . ''
damn you toys r us !
something 's very wrong .
very minor stuff .
)
, but gave us back a dog that was covered in blood .
i do n't get it .
now , super _num_ is ... a super _num_ .
there is even a nicer super _num_ near lincoln avenue .
i do n't need fancy , i just need comfy .
it was so gross !
old , smelly , & creepy .
( of course my hubby would point out they had old tvs too . )
he went next door to la quinta for $ _num_ .
room size and cleanliness were acceptable and so was was the continental breakfast .
first , it 's very pricy .
i would not recommend .
i go here a lot because i live nearby .
not really a fan .
ugh .
i dunno , new hire ?
sadly .
however , it rang up as _num_ .
i cook thai food at home .
not flavorful at all .
i will never be back .
very disappointed .
no authentic thai flavors .
bland and tasteless .
the chicken stays were microwaved .
refused to refund fraud charges !
what 's worse ?
lived in _num_ e white st , champaign for half a year .
anyway , never resident in _num_ e white !
however , i am a very clean tenant and did all my cleaning .
the apartments are not in good shape considering that they are fairly new .
this is not right .
it 's not fair .
i want my rent back .
this is ridiculous .
that 's just not right .
today is april _num_ , _num_ .
they , i quote , are `` dogs '' .
this place is over rated .
given all this , the $ _num_ entrees on the specials menu were surprising .
not so .
you have been warned .
so , went here on a busy saturday night .
i tried it twice , it underwhelmed on both occasions .
the service was n't good .
tortilla chips come standard and it 's extra for fries ?
no pink in sight .
not so much .
im gon na sum this up quickly .
and i smell like a resturant !
the seating is horrible .
terrible customer service .
we walked in and asked for a table for two .
wait time .
nothing particularly good to say about the food .
why bother ?
worst service ever .
worst place ever !
too expensive for what it is .
excessive grease is used .
however , as time went on , the food quality slowly started to slip .
bad .
i miss the old downtown champaign location .
the prosciutto tasted more like salted pork .
the meal started with bread , olive oil , and cheese for the dipping .
for my appetizer , i chose the sausage in crust .
the hostess was the one who helped us .
we asked for a discount and what did we get ... _num_ % .
the food is a pale ghost of its former self .
night at _num_ pm to pick up a sandwich .
the place was empty .
the bar is dark and a little dusty .
the drinks are worth trying but it is not great .
so , i ca n't study or do research while in there .
not cool .
i miss this place .
not worth it .
even when you do get served , it appears everything is really expensive .
loud , but good music ?
avoid !
oh , except this party also charges $ _num_ cover .
snobby and pretentious .
drinks are very weak .
too loud to hear anything .
not a fan , at all .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i effing hate this place .
all around sloppy .
extremely poor staff .
racist behavior .
it 's old technology and it needs to die .
but its too expensive .
one good thing is that the drinks are ridiculously cheap .
shots are $ _num_ , pitchers can be as low as $ _num_ .
their food was typical and not memorable and the beer is only okay .
given the choice , i would choose other bars over joe 's .
no thank you .
hello , rude waitress .
what a horrible waitress .
she really should be fired .
also , between each visit from our waitress , there is a long wait .
if you really want to try this place come for half off burgers .
i 'm thoroughly disappointed .
that sucks .
never attempt to order food for delivery from here .
there is much better sober food .
meh .
also pretty much identical to chipotle , which might be slightly better .
not worth the price .
on top of that , their hours are all over the place .
never any lines to worry about here !
horrible .
no phone call either .
this place is just alright .
do n't trust this place .
i am glad i checked with another dentist first !
do not go to champaign dental !
it 's terrible .
my first visit i went for normal x-ray and cleaning covered by insurance .
probably at least _num_ years ago .
no braces needed .
no cavities .
stay away from these money hungry thieves !
stay away from these money hungry thieves !
she made this clear _num_ times .
a desperate excuse ) .
go to peking garden instead .
i ate it because i was hungry .
like really gross .
the crab rangoon were good though a little too cream cheesy .
probably not .
so disappointed .
the biggest problem is their service .
i ate it with my chopsticks .
this is a review for their sunday night trivia .
_num_ max per team ; you pick your team name .
there are breaks for bathroom etc .
it was bad .
it was really just pico de gallo with more cucumbers .
not a soup but more of a raw salsa with large chunks .
i hated this place .
that is not ok !
i 'm not .
and it 's loud .
it 's not though .
what the hell ?
some weird management decisions at this place .
horrible experience !
not an honest business .
will not be returning .
bartender was super rude .
not kidding .
gross .
disappointing service .
room layout dumb .
finish line , you stink .
it was like i was invisible , y'all .
i walked over .
worst shopping experience ever .
i was waiting someone to help me with some pick-up stuff .
the associates saw me waiting but just walking towards the other way .
the store just sucks .
it was a saturday night , when the bar is super crowded .
anyway , you order your food to the bartenders .
i do n't like the idea .
a juicy pizza is not my favorite .
i went with two friends to have some drinks and pizza .
terrible service !
not worth it one bit !
murphy 's pub , the blind pig , and others .
there is no personality .
these things had enough salt to turn lake michigan into a salt lake .
they were awful .
shared fries , fried potstickers , pizza and chicken tenders .
i will not be coming back !
i have dietary restrictions and i need to be picky .
the salmon only cost $ _num_ and it was a fairly big portion .
so my main complaint about the lunch dining experience is sanitation .
wash your hands if you still decide to go .
okay , that 's not a big deal .
the food was average , nothing like what the other reviews here say .
if you like pizza bites , well heck , then dig in .
just awful .
but the pizza is much too small for the price .
just not cool .
lousy service !
hard to get service .
avoid !
looks like i 'll need to pick up a lawyer .
this place is ridiculous .
not worth it .
horrible heating system .
their mashed potatoes were very much like the kind you make from a box .
i ca n't help but feel this restaurant has fooled many .
all in all , not the greatest .
you 've been warned .
prix fixe dinner for two with the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu .
we left hungry , and shaking our heads .
table of _num_ , we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings .
table of _num_ , we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings .
a good restaurant is not just about food , but also about ambience .
two tables total seated eating .
service was extremely slow .
not worth the money .
best part was the hummus , which i was wishing they served more of .
it took quite awhile for just the drinks to get delivered .
when the food arrived , it was alright .
sure , why not .
completely flat .
it 's really not good .
bartender _num_ : what is going on here .
me : this tastes like corn syrup .
have you tried it .
that 's a shame .
oh radio maria , how i wish we could be in love .
ok , i 'll bite .
but it is goat cheese .
not grilled then put in the fridge over the weekend !
not me !
awful place .
pity to see an old favorite fall this far .
my husband and i recently ate at radio maria for dinner .
on a friday afternoon , i was one of six sitting at the bar .
i have tried radio maria on visits to cu .
i am giving this restaurant _num_ stars .
the food we ordered which was on a nearby table , was also covered .
the deep fried house potatoes were delish .
fill our water glasses ) , etc .
the restaurant is also extremely noisy .
the food was awful .
you could smell and taste the garlic in everything .
it was stiff and hard to chew .
this is unbelievable .
had brunch here and was recommended lobster eggs benedict .
i 've eaten here on average of around eight times a year since _num_ .
a vanilla cream sauce does n't complement goat cheese , for example .
it is n't interesting .
crystal is the worse !
just not worth going !
menu on yelp states lentil soup is made with olive oil .
i would n't get it again .
my mistake .
there was also a cigarette burn in my blanket .
low price was the main attraction .
place was noisy , and needs complete renovation .
do n't even bother .
the rate may be cheap but it 's still too much .
like sketchy gross .
not worth the value .
front desk staff is friendly but otherwise this place is a complete bust .
that 's coming from a _num_ yr old , and we all agreed .
my mom and i stayed here for _num_ nights .
Negative
we stayed only one night here .
we would not visit here again .
this was an improvement .
i go down , and yes , it 's better looking .
there 's no toilet seat !
this room is fine , he says .
i go down to the room , and it passes my quick inspection .
i check the heating unit and it 's blowing cold air .
management is friendly but everything needs cleaned .
the pool , the hallways , the bathrooms .
do n't use this company .
also technician accidentally dropped a bunch of chemicals in our yard in a pile .
never ever use this company .
someone at the company is making the application record up or cooking the book .
)
wait , restaurant ... cook my own food ?
still , our waitress was never around .
very sad .
we were sadly very disappointed .
the food was awful .
i would not recommend .
i can make a better steak at home for half the price .
waste of time .
it was an ok experience .
probably would n't go back .
steak was under cook .
wait for _num_ minutes .
and never see my sever again .
just driving through the area and had to stop for the night .
the decor made me think it would be much more affordable than it was .
i mean , vinyl tablecloths at a steakhouse ?
no steak for me .
in my mind a reservation at _num_ means you get seated around _num_ .
why not seat people at those tables ?
no you did n't .
their salesperson is too pushy and followed up around .
carpet is too expensive compared to other places .
where in this list do you see peanuts ?
overpriced and bland .
the only flavor that seems to be good here is the chocolate .
on the other hand , i ended up literally drinking it .
anyway , not my thing .
absurd wait time .
hire _num_ more people .
one person , takes orders and money , another makes the order .
the time would be cut b _num_ % .
long wait for ok ice cream .
gross ! )
ridiculous they are that slow .
terrible .
worst .
i hate chain restaurants .
certainly not convenient , cheap , or tasty .
worst kfc experience ever !
slow service .
next time i should go to jimmy johns .
i 'm the customer standing here ready to make a purchase .
worst customer service ever !
not a single smile or hello when we walked in the door .
worst service ever .
no thanks !
worst manager experience ever !
when i received my ready to pick up prompt , i drove over .
only pizza was ready .
th fish was over cooked .
horrible .
ridiculous .
unprofessional rude staff .
i bit my tongue .
this place is a joke .
1st door guy said we could come in for free anytime fri night .
expired and bad .
same thing .
terrible service .
do n't get beer here .
_num_ star is more than this place deserves .
the staff was horrible .
i 'm such an individual i need to look like everyone else ... .
absolutely horrible place !
these guys deserve better than that .
it 's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment .
not a great way to build a relationship .
hours it takes to swap them out ?
still not good enough .
i know a little something about cars .
my uncle has been a mechanic for over _num_ years .
i took my car to virginia auto service for a very specific issue .
they called me with a totally different problem the cost to fix was outrageous .
chuck 's speed shop did my block work @ $ _num_ .
their shop rate is $ _num_ .
chuck 's speed shop did my block work @ $ _num_ .
their shop rate is $ _num_ .
i was not impressed once .
no spice .
no life .
no business from me .
recently went back with a party of _num_ for a bday celebration .
bad choice .
that said , i must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious !
the place was busy and noisy .
the hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice .
very mediocre .
mediocre thai food .
it was mostly broth with few veggies .
disappointing experience .
as soon as she entered she was met by a thai staff member .
i could n't believe it .
totally lame .
my wife and i were very excited to try this place based on reviews .
very disappointing .
the manager refunded my entire tip in cash .
she took even longer to collect the bill and run our card .
the service was unacceptable .
it took a long time for us to get water or our drinks .
impossible .
it was almost impossible to manage .
ten minutes pass .
that girl probably just cost the restaurant thousands in future business .
$ _num_ extra for two shrimps !
do n't expect customer service !
if you ca n't handle the heat , then get out of the kitchen !
big fat f for this place .
disgrace .
really , where were all the servers ?
they would do well to make the customer feel a little more welcoming .
so , this place was my absolute favorite thai restaurant in phoenix until today .
she did n't even eat it !
i could see the owner busy cooking in the kitchen .
i would suggest she spend a little more time on the front .
i could n't believe my eyes .
its not that great .
sadly .
will not be going back .
it seems like every time we come here there 's a line .
you decide which is more important .
for me , there are plenty of better thai places in the area .
i 've never experienced anything like that .
absolute horrendous customer service .
the food is terrible .
the peanut sauce is more like gravy then sauce , thick and gritty .
terrible service !
cold .
terrible service !
poor table service !
we went on a saturday night and there were plenty of tables available .
ca n't complain about the chicken pad thai because it was great .
i ordered chicken pad thai .
not worth taking anything home .
went there with a group i 'm in .
gross !
Negative
i 'm disappointed .
the rice was n't fresh .
service was terrible !
we drove _num_ hours from sedona to eat here .
total of _num_ people together .
poor service .
very misleading and deceptive .
i 'm very disappointed .
i am _num_ years old .
i do not recommend central phoenix !
my experience was terrible .
unbelievable .
thank you for your reply to this _num_ months later .
keep in mind , this was the 1st time i had met her .
just know that your patients surely do miss you .
the problem was the dry and hard food .
the beds were comfortable .
they have a pool , a jacuzzi , and a workout room .
it was a roof over our heads .
it is not a great hotel .
stupid short bed .
their change machine was down for well over a week !
`` hello , did you find everything you are looking for today ? ''
did we really need another one ?
does n't corporate come by every once and a while ?
every time i go , they 're out of something .
i '' m talking basics .
bread , milk , soda .
it is atrocious .
not anymore .
walk over to the produce and pick up a tomato !
`` no !
this safeway is ghetto ... for arizona .
very random and sketchy .
the huge problem here , is everything else .
it makes for an unsafe situation for everyone .
at each opportunity to impress , the complete opposite happens .
the last time was my last time ever walking into either safeway store .
can i give this _num_ stars ?
i hate this safeway .
there are never enough cashiers .
i could n't believe it .
it 's that bad .
_num_ ) what carts you ask ?
bad experience all around !
i apologized and was only met with more attitude .
there were _num_ .
but it seems to be quite busy .
keep the $ _num_ , y'all need it more than me !
pathetic at best .
Neutral
not good .
they brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas .
went here for dinner with a group of _num_ .
too extreme for me .
ca n't beat that ... except maybe with a couple of rounds of patron .
not as good as i had hoped .
minus : way too salty .
everything except the salad had far more salt than necessary or even reasonable .
nasty .
my stomach hurts .
poor form .
very disappointing .
the food is mediocre .
... ... ... .
it looks like something i could have created using visual basic in high school .
positives :
because the food came out so late we had to get it boxed up .
would n't recommend eating here !
how very disappointing .
ate there last night for one reason , the fabulous location .
she was helpful and asked if she could get us anything else .
staff was rude and obnoxious .
most likely will not be back .
group decision , not a personal preference to return .
i had the chicken fajitas night _num_ .
even to get our waters took a long time .
chicken ?
wo n't be back .
taste was lackluster .
terrible service - period .
i 'm not the server ; i 'm the paying patron .
they closed early and are not reliable .
never going back .
the food was terrible !
i treated my mom and aunt to lunch .
my coworker got the ahi tuna southwestern salad and he rated it 4/5 stars .
mediocre food .
mediocre service .
not my cup of tea !
everything manages to have a bitter taste that i just can not explain .
still the place is usually crowded .
but has a problem with someone buying someone food when they are hungry .
shame shame !
please check your order before you leave the driver through window .
this place does so-so to the max .
it 's okay .
and there seems to be interactive things for kids too !
i like a lot of museums in phoenix .
the place was insanely overcrowded for the small space .
the margaritas were too strong to enjoy .
so you ate and that was it .
let 's start with positives ...
- concessions , a dumpy little espresso kiosk ?
i have a feeling , that these folks , are volunteers .
ridiculous .
it 's cheap , it 's fast , the name is familiar ?
i once went _num_ years without eating at a taco bell .
avoid like the plague .
- the place was total sausage fest .
like _num_ dudes to one girl .
- hot wings , surprisingly , we 're okay .
- cole slaw , more like sugar slaw .
vote elsewhere .
especially seeing that i have _num_ children under the age of _num_ .
there was nothing on it .
probably not .
the food was gross .
drinks are cheap .
here 's the downfall .
food did n't look appetizing .
would n't be surprised .
fail .
another issues i had with this place was the dj .
he came over and introduced himself as the dj from chicago .
it 's not .
the one thing that stood out was the chunky bleu cheese dressing .
lame . ''
ordered a caesar salad with grilled shrimp and a side of avocado .
the service was attentive , but not overbearing .
stopped in for a bite to eat before catching a game at chase stadium .
very disappointed .
the service was terrible .
we would not go back .
boy was i wrong !
i ordered the chicken sandwich with sprouts and avocado .
nothing more , nothing less .
tried some chips and salsa too .
not on my list for a quick return .
worst experience ever !
pathetic and unprofessional .
huge disappointment !
ordered _num_ burgers medium .
we will not be back .
i may not be back .
nachos are chips with taco bell meat and obvious nacho cheese from a pump .
the milk was bad !
like where they serve it from should change my perspective .
it was awful .
it was good but nothing worth going crazy over .
that is just gross .
they brought them to me very quickly .
she did n't check on refills .
called to make sure they could change my watch battery .
there was nothing going on inside .
that the cab is still _num_ miles away !
i live about _num_ miles from the airport .
the first person i spoke to was very understanding and apologetic for my experience .
never calling yellow cab again .
dispatch informed someone would arrive .
i wish the company can find out who this lady was .
the site gave me a confirmation number .
i would not recommend this company .
driver was very rude .
he was very rude .
way too many fucking issues .
he doesnt fucking understand i dont have time .
my recommendation is to dump this company and find other cab service companies .
Positive
worst experience ever !
horrible .
i got out of the car to get my bags .
i will never use yellow cab again .
very poor customer service .
the operator said it was _num_ mins .
beyond frustrating !
it 's now past my original reservation time .
rates to the airport are a different rate than `` street rates '' .
what a train wreck .
you guys wonder why everyone is switching to uber ?
it was a mistake .
i was craving pizza .
i do not recommend .
i tried the asian , garlic buffalo and sam adams bbq .
skip it !
after my last visit ( my 4th to this location ) , i quit .
rooms and bathrooms are small .
not much privacy !
happened about once every _num_ seconds .
for a few bucks more i could have stayed at the hyatt or something .
not so rad .
management was horrible .
gross .
sorry hotel san carlos .
while you are a charming little old hotel , you 're not for me .
on the other hand , the valet attendant exceeded my expectations .
he was very personable and helpful .
hated it !
maybe snap your fingers too .
that 's the problem .
the night person and the morning person seem to be on different pages .
( for me , not the hotel staff . )
this hotel was awful .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
small room facing the main street ( quiet though ) .
do not stay here .
next time i would stay at a nearby hotel from a national chain .
there was a somewhat weird vibe about the place but nothing really standing out .
gross , just gross .
this hotel is horrible !
nothing like waiting until the last minute to clean it up !
that 's how thin the walls are btw .
_num_ stars .
the hotel also claimed to have room service and cable .
the furniture was chipped and the walls were dingy .
at home i 'm used to a cramped _num_ year old bathroom .
we are not talking shabby chic .
i booked it because it was cheap .
and kinda gross .
horrible .
none in the bathroom !
so i had to blow my hair dry in the other room .
as others have posted , the walls are quite thin .
the valet drives up in his personal car .
the walls are thin .
not impressed .
Neutral
the pool was ice cold .
why would it even be off ?
they had water bottles in the room for _num_ a bottle .
very rude !
worst pedicure ever .
absolutely horrible experience .
do not get jessica .
i 've never been treated that way at an aveda salon .
holy bad service !
forgot order like _num_ times .
worst service ever !
this place does not even deserve one star .
poor , slow service .
and the manager just blew off the mistakes .
i would n't bother .
that is not natural .
i have been going to this ihop every month for _num_ years .
`` the kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups .
we found a new home and they will get _num_ stars on my review .
the benefit of coming here is that its open _num_ hrs .
nothing else around the area was open at 5:30 am .
and being slow .
my daughter made me come but next time i 'll put my foot down .
if i could leave less than one star i would .
no more .
no lemon .
the sour dough change must have really been an issue .
i eat my half sandwich , two grapes and two slices of oranges .
i could wait to leave .
not the best tip either .
the worst ever !
there is _num_ couple waiting to be seated ahead of us .
terrible .
went here this morning not really craving breakfast .
he tells me they are out of ranch dressing .
she was not happy .
ridiculous !
ignorant servers .
literally , everybody 's order was messed up .
this place is ridiculous .
the rice was pretty good , however , as was the guacamole .
not so .
we went at lunch and the waiting area was packed !
my coworker ordered the chile relleno and chicken enchilada lunch special .
my husband and i got the shredded beef tacos and enchiladas .
nothing special or authentic here .
i do n't get it .
you can decide for yourself which to pick .
i do n't need beans and rice on the same plate .
will not be going back .
she said there is nothing less spicy than that .
the food was n't good either .
i am totally shocked that people like this restaurant .
it 's not free refills fyi !
they start you off with chips and salsa .
mediocre .
nothing worth dying for .
the chicken taco and enchilada were ok.
my tostada was soggy .
like , i might throw up everything i ate .
ok i 'm done .
dishonest !
are you kidding me ?
maria told me what the price was and it almost doubled upon pick up .
after a good wait , we find out breakfast ends at 11am .
all of which i could live with , had the food been outstanding .
if you know me , you know i can eat .
my husband 's combo was as generic as they come .
poor service !
the chips and salsa were just okay .
not authentic in the least .
not to mention they offer hard tacos .
the answer was `` there 's nothing i can do about that . ''
by the way i have never written a review like this before .
this is where that salsa we discussed earlier comes in .
not good .
wrong .
gross .
disappointing .
i was given a small bag of tortilla chips , and those were passable .
stopped by during a brief trip to the area .
go taco bell its better .
stopped at this place on the way to phx airport .
gross .
never once did i hear my number be called .
it was busy in there so i continued to wait .
the lady then informed me that someone else took my food !
are you freaking kidding me ?
i only get half an hour for my lunch so i was furious !
i 'm sure it 's like every other taco shop on mcdowell .
are they hard shell or soft shell ?
only chicken , carne asada or fish .
the meat was just okay nothing stands out .
chicken `` works '' giant burrito .
thus place is going down hill .
on this visit i choose the grilled chicken and steak tacos .
chicken tacos were not very good .
beef taco was ok.
veggie burrito was ok.
gigantic burrito was not very good .
so sad !
ive been coming here for _num_ years and used to love this place .
my _num_ star review is now _num_ .
this is probably one of the better places phoenix has to offer .
much like grocery store packaged sushi .
really , avoid these !
the crab puffs were nice though .
wanted a light lunch , so ordered a veggie rice bowl .
i chose to have the teriyaki chicken bowl as a replacement .
Neutral
that being said , i only tried the chicken teriyaki bowl .
this was horrible !
does anyone know a good pizza delivery place downtown phoenix ?
avoid the teriyaki chicken !
the saving grace for blue fin are the portions and price point .
so i went to a late lunch with the moms this weekend .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
this place desperately wants to upscale .
but of course they were doughy and meh .
wings are skimpy and over-cooked to a tough , stringy texture .
when we arrived , we ordered a beer , and a soda .
i flagged one of the bartenders down .
yes , i am cut off .
not worth the stop .
the fish was bland .
and this only after my girlfriend went to the bar and explain our situation .
i really wanted to like this place .
we ordered a sandwich that was piled high with turkey .
wo n't be back .
such a terrible experience .
she ate hers i sent mine back .
maybe you should get your facts straight before posting a reply .
granted , she was a bitch , but a bitch with a valid point .
are you kidding me ?
are you kidding me ?
the worst part ?
i said no thanks .
not good .
and a beef ( leather ) thing with noodles .
the steamed rice was a `` _num_ '' for me .
i if you are in the neighborhood , you 've got ta stop by .
less flavorful and not as authentic .
holy mother of chicken , christmas and rice .
the ambiance is cool but it does n't justify it .
wrong .
the food is horrible .
`` she is on thin ice with the owner who is right there .
boo : it 's eight hundred degrees outside , and you know what ?
boo : no substitutions .
i like it very very very thick , which fate 's was .
the tofu was good , though , crispy and not gooey .
no thank you .
this place is n't all that it 's hyped up to be .
it was just awful !
not so this last time .
the food was awful .
may be this is some breakfast joint and i 'll get me some grits .
the sauce was soupy .
i really want to like this place .
unfortunately the service is terrible .
the food so , not so great .
)
i am mexican ... and i know mexican food .
food here is greasy and old .
just wish the food was better !
that fuzzy stuff is probably 10+ years of dust .
promptly served _num_ glasses of ice water and a menu .
chose bacon & eggs for $ _num_ .
overall , just o.k .
so i really can not comment on how great it was .
but like sing high , the downtown nostalgia restaurants are extremely scary .
soft and cheesy , the beans saved the day .
should my beans be orange ?
i was served promptly and and my food came out quickly .
service was slow .
they did n't even offer sangria .
i am from chicago where authentic mexican restaurants are abundant .
terrible service .
chips tasted stale .
it 's really not that hard .
ick !
ick # _num_ !
when all is said and done , yes , i 'm full .
the giant horse scared me !
i thought it was a real stuffed horse at first glance .
it was disgusting .
i had a pita sandwich and it was just under $ _num_ .
the menu looks like it was written by a kid in the first grade .
also , it was written on one piece of white paper .
a bit slow .
the food was not good .
it was terrible .
however , the potato salad was tasty .
ugh .
he was terrible .
_num_ .
i ordered two entrees , fried rice , egg rolls and two beverages .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it was $ _num_ .
_num_ .
that killed my appetite .
also the place looked like a dump .
but her office staff gets _num_ stars .
bottom line do n't pee in the cup .
this may be a record ; they lasted less than _num_ hrs for me !
giant mistake .
i 'm going back to verizon and im never leaving again !
third , they completely use too much dressing on their salads .
bad food , worse service .
the waitress was hot , though .
but it was like pulling teeth to get more .
eh ... .
i was disgusted .
nothing too fancy or exciting .
went to the movie early saturday evening , but ate beforehand .
why did n't i check yelp first ?
i got this chicken parmesan type dish , only made mexican style .
anyways , i think the ideas here are good , just need better execution .
the chips and salsa were good with a little bit of spice .
the only flavor at this restaurant was in the salsa .
it was so bland .
horrible and fake !
so fake .
for lunch _num_ taco with rice and beans $ _num_ .
nasty margarita and awful service .
i had the tortilla soup and the grilled chicken tacos .
not truly flavorful , nothing truly distinct .
probably not .
she was prompt at with refilling our ice tea , but not hovering .
a mexican restaurant without con queso is crazy !
but it 's not there yet .
i ordered the chicken deep fried tacos .
i really was n't impressed .
no flavor .
the food was not good .
the food was mediocre .
felt that this was very generic .
the server was courteous which is always a must for me .
as i 'm writing i 'm tasting the guacamole .
very bland !
today it was horrible .
even taco bell can do a better job .
will not be going again .
no calls .
... i was pissed !
what is it with everything closing sooo damn early in phoenix !
( ... i am from la ) .
avoid at all costs .
... just go there instead .
i 'm pissed .
i had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it .
your tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced .
stay away from this hooters .
bad food , bad service .
not hot at all ) .
however , friend # _num_ received the same thing this time .
friend # _num_ ordered a dozen hot wings .
overpriced food with shady looking waitresses .
my buddy goes , `` umm , can we get some service ?
i asked for ranch and never got it .
btw , those big tables were long gone by then .
gross .
stopped here for a late night snack .
shortly , i was brought over _num_ sliders that were the size of meatballs .
umm ... it was clean .
they have tables but really low seats and some tables with high stools .
the food came out and the fish on appearance looked fried .
the lady stated that it was breaded and grilled .
not a service friendly place .
i 'm extremely disappointed .
this was really disappointing .
this was n't okay .
bad management !
finally try to get a waitress .
Negative
nothing was special .
walked in to have some quick appetizers before a movie .
horrible customer service !
Neutral
Negative
bad service , worse food .
i would not recommend this place .
i went to hooters after a meeting with some friends .
a short walk from the convention center .
food was pretty bad .
the chicken itself was mcdonald 's quality .
this place sucks .
showed up with _num_ girlfriends for the last ufc fights .
walked in and sat at the table our friend was waiting .
overcooked pasta , check .
look people , al dente and toss the alfredo on the noodle .
not my deal , though .
avoid at all costs .
so not cool .
i remember when going to the spaghetti company was something to look forward to .
the salad was mostly dismal .
second , our waiter brought it out with the other salads .
for generic italian food , go to the olive garden .
other than service , the food is doing little to impress me .
this gave me time to look around again for the first time .
clam chowder was the soup and salty was its name .
this added garlic , mushrooms and bacon .
the portions were smaller than i remembered .
rather than send it back i kept the salad .
i 'll begin with the food .
the staff were friendly enough , but a little too casual .
all i ordered was the soup and salad lunch special .
just about everyone else was dissatisfied with their meals .
there is way many better italian food restaurants in the valley .
not sure .
a joke of a salad .
the lasagna was loaded with meat and just enough ricotta to balance .
the color on everything that we were served was off and pale .
my pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce .
chances of going back are slim to none .
our server was prompt and our drinks came quickly .
i had spaghetti with meat sauce and my wife and son had chicken parmesan .
the prices here a similar to most italian chain restaurants .
horrible service .
not as good as an olive garden .
again , horrible service !
i do not recommend .
disgusting !
pasta was overcooked .
having been there before , my friend knew she wanted the lasagna .
all entrees come with bread , soup or salad , and tea or coffee .
our waiter delivered the soup and salad , but forgot the dressing .
what a rip off .
cheap .
the italian sausage i was afraid to even bite into .
my family of _num_ went for dinner on a saturday night .
under _num_ is the max .
the guest are broke , or old .
they 're here for a cheap feeding .
and - you should tip according to how much you ate .
horrible experience !
service was ok , nothing special .
crap from a can .
but not an appetizing smell .
we ordered the lasagna with marinara sauce and manicotti with meat sauce .
the noodles were cooked perfectly and that 's where the praise stops .
ugh .
i got the chicken parmigiana with fettuccine alfredo .
the portion of food in comparison to the price , is small .
the food portions need to be increased by _num_ % .
garlic bread and complementary bread were pretty good .
very hard to eat more than a couple bites .
i met several friends for a birthday here , saturday night .
my check for _num_ was about $ _num_ including the added gratuity .
our server , michael was awesome .
totally lost my appetite !
still no water .
still no water .
went here to meet a friend for lunch .
flavor was very disappointing .
food just was not that good .
just gross .
_num_ thumbs down !
pure garbage .
wrong !
i 'm going to miss it the way it was .
lousy customer service .
if they say a _num_ minute wait .
sad and pitiful really .
just left here , will not be back .
no toilet paper .
not good .
i went on a wednesday , during lunch , when school was in session .
i will not be going back .
definately not worth $ _num_ !
i 've been there for breakfast and lunch and it 's ok .
terrible sandwich .
wrong !
the worst part ?
they put a piece of individually wrapped cheese between two dry pieces of toast !
i went , that 's it , i 'm done .
f ?
that screams out `` filler '' .
tonight was the last time .
and we did , it was tom 's restaurant and tavern .
it was served dry with tomato and lettuce if you wanted it .
i wish this place were better !
quit the food , up the drinks .
the staff was very attentive , hostess was cheerful and welcomed us warmly .
# _num_ who puts jalapeno in spinach artichoke dip ?
she sucked .
the service was horrible .
service was horrible .
my wife is not a picky eater so this was to take note of .
it was super bowl weekend and they were understaffed so i get it .
i was sooo excited to find your place .
i ca n't speak of the cobbler though .
i received a only a handful of fries and my soda was mostly ice .
the hours of operation seem just random for one .
so ... ... get your car washed at your own risk .
terrible car wash !
avoid at all cost !
worst car wash ever .
i get the same bs everytime i go .
went to los olivos for the first time today to get my car washed .
i am going to have to vacuum it again myself later .
rick was the gentleman from los olivos who accompanied me .
not acceptable .
first time i purchased the $ _num_ basic wash .
not so much on the inside but it could use a clean .
my seats were not vacuumed .
they gave me vanilla .
i could have saved myself some money and time if i did do that .
do not go here .
this is ridiculous !
slow .
... slow .
so slow .
not a day later and it was all over the side of the truck .
ridiculous wait times !
Negative
they were so rude .
this is where i started kicking myself for not washing my own car .
wrong .
not even close .
took them almost an hour to wash my car .
i was not told that .
there was n't .
the car wash itself is ok .
slowest car wash ever .
first off i have been coming here for a couple years .
my problem now ?
not me .
they better miss me with that bullshit .
why are they such jerks ?
total attitude from the time i walked in to paying the bill .
pastrami was nothing special .
do n't bother .
just finished my first trip to the downtown deli .
so , so sad !
my only down note is on the service .
i went back and tried it again .
we stopped in for lunch last week .
and my husband selected the greek chicken marinara .
it is a void .
the sandwiches were dry and not very good .
my chicken sandwich was dry .
the menu is so limited .
would you like chicken or chicken ?
chicken in a pita ?
chicken on some lettuce ?
chicken rolled in a tortilla ?
pretty colors and shiny things however do n't impress my palate .
the coupon gave me pretty much any menu item with a drink purchase .
and if you scratch the dressing , it 'll be healthy .
( still i 'm strangely addicted to it ) .
you can go to paradise or subway for a whole lot less .
so gross !
my intention is not to get free stuff .
that being said , here is my update .
then he asks for my address so he can send me a gift certificate .
unnecessary , i tell him , but nice touch .
i was pretty excited to try this place .
i was disappointed .
i 'm glad i took the workers suggestions because the pasta salad was amazing !
i ordered the steak kabobs with roasted vegetables and potatoes .
the chicken tasted great , the greek salad it was served on was flavorful .
horrible customer response .
i got _num_ cups of ice cream .
the met apartments are not energy efficient !
this is the most understaffed subway in phx .
it was not very busy .
their sandwiches really are n't all that healthy .
i wouldnt call this a salsa club .
it looked ok , i liked the outside patio ?
but i left outta there wanting to go to a real latin club .
_num_ .
_num_ .
now maybe 3-4 .
if that station is not playing great music try _num_ .
so , we were led back to hard rock cafe .
the food is average and the drinks are n't anything out of the ordinary .
a hard rock scottsdale would be way cooler .
we had overpriced salads and hamburgers that were large and filling and tasted decent .
turned around , went back in , and told the hostess .
in fact , we should already be closed . ''
as a bartender , i 'd have insisted that it be so .
maybe it 's the corporate management bs that was in the way .
nothing special .
most of us had burgers and they were all just basic burgers .
the fries were bland .
i went to the phoenix hard rock cafe for lunch on a friday .
the entry is nothing eye catching or grand as it was then .
lame !
_num_ people walk in on a friday night .
seriously , i think she thought she was done for the night .
limited beer selection .
mediocre food .
not worth the wait .
ca n't remember the last time i was at a hard rock cafe .
he clearly could n't care less .
- the veggies on the side to put on the burger were n't crisp .
i usually like lettuce on my burger , but not their wilted lettuce .
while i 'm not a music expert , my guest is .
the food sucks .
$ _num_ burgers that do n't look interesting ?
a very bad experience .
_num_ stars for just the food .
for _num_ minutes .
horribly cooked burger .
go to arrogant butcher .
at this rate , i 'm surprised they even have customers .
get your act together , hard rock !
we return to see the food taken away .
i was completed disappointed .
our server was mediocre .
we all received _num_ cookies .
worst experience ever .
slow .
this place is ridiculous !
i have family visiting from out of town .
will not be returning .
this is the short bus of all mcdonald 's .
are you freaking kidding me ?
this is fast food not your local coffee shop .
oh , wait .
got ta remember not to return here ever !
bad service .
also i spotted a few homeless guys just outside sitting .
not only that , the place is n't all that neat .
however the bright spot is this smoking hot young mexican woman named kim .
total waste of time .
i 've tried multiple times and they just never have it .
rude !
i wish it were better because i live around the corner .
sonic down the street from now on .
just does n't scream exciting to me .
very nice facility , easy to get around .
my stomach was upset by the small amount i sampled .
note : i will update my review if i need to go back .
we ordered the full sized breakfast burritos with cheddar and black forest bacon .
try the breakfast club across the street .
during a busy lunch rush you would imagine that sandwiches could be made quickly .
waiting 15-20 minutes is ridiculous .
no thanks .
disgusting .
it did n't take that long to cook .
when i got my sandwich , it was a skinny little thing .
nothing compares to it !
business hours posted said they closed at 4pm on saturday 's .
the arizona center is to phoenix as the galleria is to scottsdale .
the lady at the phoenix visitors center highly suggested we check this place out .
needed a quick bite across the street after i landed at the sheraton .
everything else is sit down with waiter service .
too quote a famous movie `` iceberg ahead !
lame !
lame !
no more , no more !
this is just sad .
absolutely wasted potential .
that 's a shame .
rude .
terrible , terrible service .
impersonal and rude service .
will not go back .
the manager makes my nail technician leave me and do linda williams job .
but it was not .
the lady doing my manicure was nice , at least she smiled .
do n't talk to me like i 'm twelve .
this is the first time yelp reviews have let me down .
i called the salon and they asked i return and have the shellac redone .
i did and the following day the shellac was cracking and peeling .
i went to this place because it was close and the reviews were good .
update : after going here for over two years , i am done .
disgusting !
and when i say yelled i mean yelled .
it was freaking horrible .
but she did not .
do not go to this place !
the ambiance is horrible .
very depressing .
i 'm here because i want someone else to do it .
the pedicure was painful .
no drying lamps .
horrible .
gross .
waited _num_ min and nothing .
horrible customer service !
this place is awful .
wrong .
she was rude .
i do not recommend this place .
she was extremely rude .
not relaxing at all .
horrible , horrible experience .
not good experience .
i do n't recommend .
they look horrible !
you might as well buy some pre-made sushi from the grocery store .
_num_ dollars for a philly ?
i had take out yesterday and this place was just nearby my hotel .
the service was horrible .
the experience was very off .
but alas , two weeks after going here they are closed down .
_num_ visits in the last month .
both visits were n't good .
not impressed .
sushi rolls were terrible !
totally wasting money .
i tried this place for lunch because it 's located right across my work .
_num_ star for saying `` thank you .
had to ask for dressing , the cook apologized saying he forgot .
ok so we 're sitting here as i type this review .
holy gross !
very rude service .
i paid with a credit card , so i obviously had money .
sorry , honey bears .
bland .
for shame !
sides are completely forgettable .
and for _num_ bucks , i want better .
if they get that right , i 'll throw another star at them .
just not impressed at all .
i went honey bear 's with my wife to use a groupon .
the chicken was drenched in sauce hiding the flavor .
( _num_ stars ) .
not impressed .
overall , it was a _num_ because nothing blew me away .
)
but the big problem were the ribs .
i tried the mac and cheese as well as the cole slaw .
it was n't even worth getting my money back .
the food sucks .
not a fan of this location .
this place has dry .
my husband and i decided to try a new place tonight .
the cheese in the mac was a bit thin .
our original order came to _num_ the groupon was for _num_ .
went to central ave location .
dam i am mad .
will not be going back .
no more .
not that crowded .
_num_ ( _num_ ! )
this was my first time to this place and probably the last !
well not here .
the sandwich was awful .
it came with _num_ sides an with tax was about $ _num_ .
went there with my girlfriend for what i thought would be good bbq .
ridiculous .
boiled meat covered in bbq sauce is not bbq .
tolerable but not satisfying at all .
probably have to roll up in a tank now , just to be safe .
crappy bun .
had i gotten there too early to be served yesterday 's reheated chicken ?
maybe built in _num_ and never remodeled .
_num_ star for a successful pulled brisket sandwich .
i just was n't impressed .
it 's like they hate other black people .
customer service is always creepy .
the cheap bun does n't support the sauce .
did the yelp check in coupon for $ _num_ off .
a coworker and i went here for lunch about a week ago .
big mistake .
moreover , they served me the very last serving of brisket .
literally a faint odor of dog food .
the service was , umm , strange .
not friendly or unfriendly .
just uncomfortable .
we had eaten honey bears ribs frequently 10-15 years ago .
the meat was flavorless .
the bottom bun was practically liquid .
really unpleasant .
hot dogs .
i was traveling from los angeles , hoping for a good meal .
this place is garbage .
not filling at all .
tacky tables with bus stop ads in them .
bland food .
not a fan .
i think the meats are boiled and not smoked .
do n't eat here .
sub-par pulled pork sandwich .
bbq sauce was nothing special .
it was terrible !
forget it .
not worth it .
the beer was papago orange blossom ( which is glorious ! )
horrible customer service !
strangely rude and condescending .
poor service , poor choices .
lights kept going out , iced tea never got refilled .
all around disappointing .
just not worth the money .
it was hard and just not appealing .
yes , i do believe every restaurant deserves a second chance .
was not impressed at all .
will not be back .
nothing special .
i was just at a wine dinner tonight .
went here for easter brunch .
it was like eating outside , except we were indoors .
it is _num_ star food with _num_ star prices .
that is not a caesar salad .
that is not bruschetta .
my companions ordered shared salad and flatbread which arrived without sharing plates .
the prickly pear margarita was very small .
az restaurant week inspired me to try a new place .
it appeared the az restaurant week menu was our only option for dinner .
not my idea of a cool wine bar at all .
atmosphere was blah .
do not go to this restaurant !
looks like they closed their doors only a few days ago .
too bad .
they were cool for a week but that week has long passed .
in fact , its just pretty generic .
i find nothing appealing about this place .
or worse .
the food is bland .
nothing pops at this restaurant when it comes to the food .
it was dead inside .
the service was suck though .
when we were , we ordered beer and wine .
our waiter dropped off my boyfriend 's beer .
so , he ordered another beer .
when my food arrived , it had lettuce and tomato on it .
dry fish , cheddar cheese and lemon ?
this place i had mixed feeling about .
i went here with my friend for lunch .
as far as the toppings a+ , the baguette roll a+ .
our service was not any better .
a little too late .
but , the food , that is another story .
drinks only ok !
_num_ words describes this place : tourist trap .
anyway , along comes the food .
each side is a dollar , by t he way .
way too salty .
such a disappointment .
you can buy apparel , cups and more at the counter .
very loud .
the restrooms are not clean .
i know they 're busy but they 're neglected just like the tables .
service is bad .
i got the bbq sampler thing and my husband got nachos .
dont fall for the trap like me !
this place sucks .
not worth it .
are you freaking kidding me.
with a few changes it could be a _num_ star joint .
horrible experience .
gross !
i ordered a turkey sandwich .
just awful .
left before getting waited on !
the place was packed too .
- the restrooms are like gas station restrooms .
- service is slow .
overall , not a good experience .
horrible !
it has a huge outdoor patio area , plus balcony , plus indoor seating .
too bad .
worst barbecue ever .
that makes it really simple for everyone .
for a football event i went to , they were offering breakfast .
as for drinks , they really are just overpriced .
i know they have rent , i get it .
horrible pricing decision .
atmosphere is ok , it could be so much better .
i have made suggestions for other locations , and those suggestions stand .
wrong .
complete and total let down .
the kids deserve so much better .
my buffalo chicken wrap was minus the buffalo !
my wrap was n't even hot .
had an order of _num_ chicken wings with the sauce on the side .
typical selection of beers and drinks .
first time i actually checked in on yelp .
this is just a noisy sports bar .
but otherwise , meh , i 've experienced better .
went here while in phx on business with a friend who lives locally .
no such luck .
they only give a small cup of bbq sauce for your meal .
huge disappointment !
we ordered their signature hot dog , the hamburger sliders and cheese fries .
it was disgusting .
bbq meat tasted old .
been there plenty of times before .
all visits alright , not exceptional though .
so disappointed !
staying in tempe but made the short trip into phoenix specifically to go here .
mike , the bartender , waited on me .
not very friendly .
nothing really stood out with my meal .
everything was pretty mediocre .
so rude !
the decor and wait staff are interesting and service was average .
i ordered a salad with grilled chicken .
i could have received a better salad at mcdonald 's .
bbq beans from a can , served in tiny plastic cups .
really not anything special .
so it 's an ok place & glad i went .
not much else to say about this place .
wo n't be back .
the food was not good .
maybe get a beer but not the food .
if i 'm buying a premium drink it should be served in a glass .
a little ghetto in areas .
very disappointing experience .
my husband and i shared the big unit and `` meh '' .
waste of time .
beer was n't cold .
actually i take that partially back , the chips and salsa were good .
this one little thing would improve this place immensely .
after the game we stopped again , same thing .
pretty terrible all around .
would n't go back .
smell is horrible !
service was first rate - amy is a rock star .
everything else is what you would expect from an older covered basketball stadium .
ok i am biased .
had a terrible time .
however , the sound was ridiculously loud to the point of hurting your ears .
the lines were incredibly long .
absolutely ridiculous !
are you kidding me ?
a _num_ ounce water bottle .
i would make a fortune , i 'm sure .
not in phoenix .
very disappointed !
for $ _num_ i could n't believe it .
worst ever .
really ?
_num_ lbs .
do not stay here .
poor customer service !
epic failure !
the place was only a third full at most .
ca n't wait until sliders opens for the season !
worst customer service ever !
before sitting down we asked a waiter if the table was available .
)
horrible experience .
empty tables everywhere .
completely lame .
but horrible service .
then the manager finally came and sat us at a regular table .
literally had to tell her every aspect of her job , step by step .
horrible !
not real busy inside .
wrong .
the food was horrible .
fries were cold .
thumbs down .
thumbs down .
left paying over _num_ for sodas and _num_ meals .
thumbs down .
very bad experience .
and this experience makes me wish we had eaten the concession food ... .
first off , there is n't anywhere to wait .
the hostesses and waiters were all under _num_ .
absolutely horrible service today .
i was left speechless .
worst service ever !
while the food and atmosphere were great , our waiter was anything but .
pay attention people or get off yelp .
i had the bourbon chicken , meh !
came on the side , in a little dish , i mean little .
this double standard makes me never want to go there again .
their are other options , like hard rock cafe .
terrible experience .
it was terrible .
Neutral
i was just sent to the start of the _num_ menu again .
worst customer service ever !
welcome to impersonal banking at its lowest .
very unprofessional and rude employees .
no hot water .
i would n't stay here again .
horrible hotel !
my room was dirty .
i had low expectations of the hotel , which turned out to be accurate .
very loud air conditioning unit .
breakfast selection limited compared to most hotels .
the new room had its own new problems and new stains .
again , this was my experience with quality inn and suites .
so dallas g and i were thinking of a lunch spot .
feta or no feta ?
it has little cheese and is not flaky .
anyway , the restaurant pretty much blew .
is he gon na hate it ?
your last name is greek .
not because of the taste .
_num_ % completely underwhelming .
they get packed for lunch and have lots of chicago shit on the walls .
- awful gyro meat .
- fries are n't anything special .
my husband and i ate here after i purchased a groupon .
weak .
little out of the way , but way better and you wont leave hungry .
_num_ .
_num_ .
`` this is how a house is built .
disappointing .
the digital world might have been interesting in _num_ .
first of all , this place is expensive !
i was bored .
this was god awful .
this was totally lost .
this is a review only for our student field trip booking experience .
most disappoint museum experience ever .
besides that the information presented was short and not in depth .
so why only two stars ?
parking was confusing .
holy crap !
the layout of the place is confusing .
nothing really makes sense in the layout .
way too expensive .
our ears ringing , we wandered around visiting the exhibits .
some did n't work at all .
this place has gone down hill .
after two hours , we were done .
too bad .
could n't get near the exhibits .
really poor sound control .
( what finish would you chose for your bathroom ?
such a ripoff .
such a disappointment .
did n't like it .
skip it .
they should really change the name of this place to the arizona kids place .
oddly enough two employees were feet from where he fell .
ppl like michelle work at the az science center .
i 'm assuming michelle just does n't like kids .
i would not recommend this company .
my car became disabled in my garage .
called this towing company on the recommendation from my car dealer .
ugh .
does n't anybody give good customer service anymore ?
shady business practices all around .
because that is what all reputable operations do , run on a cash basis .
we ordered online + _num_ star .
then he had the nerve to ask me if we still wanted it .
_num_ stars .
pizza is inconsistent .
Negative
i ordered two medium sized pizza with thin crust .
not happy subway .
and get your teeth cleaned !
that yucky yellow stuff is called tartar and it can be removed .
i have been to this subway at 16th st and thomas many times .
the first time it happened i just blew it off .
instead of treating your patients better , just fill them up with more pills .
is your stomach hurting ?
the care we received was substandard .
there are hospitals that provide better service in our opinion .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
not cool .
i 'm not kidding .
overall many doctors and nurses were helpful in the care of my mom .
they have everyone in this one room waiting for hours .
horrible !
worst experience ever !
first baby having their in _num_ and i almost die !
wo n't recommend .
my husband ordered two enchiladas , one machaca and one chicken .
we are white , and the others getting better service are hispanic .
skip this joint !
disappointing .
our waitress was one of the most surly servers i 've ever had anywhere .
very odd and not really nice at all .
no complaints at all .
i 'm not difficult to please .
horrible experience .
we were very disappointed .
i tried this place for the first time for the raved about menudo .
not spectacular , but it satisfied my pregnancy craving for menudo .
you get what you pay for , which is not much here .
but check your bill before paying .
that does n't sit well in my book .
the food is horrible !
the salsa was weird .
annoying .
maybe dine-in would be a better way to experience rosita 's .
when i got home , i fed the leftovers to the chickens !
again , hard to get service .
food was very mediocre .
asked for chorizo with fried eggs , but got it all scrambled .
not busy btw .
tamales were old and tough as leather .
service was slow .
disappointed .
the service was bad .
the waitress was also difficult to find .
they charge for chips and sauce on top of the burrito .
dumb .
thanks yelpers , following advice of others is not always good .
how hard is it to screw up a taco ?
and sell hungry but will opt out of yelp for dinner tonight .
_num_ stars .
_num_ toilets in the ladies room , last nite one was broke .
they are all rude !
this guy is awful .
i went to him for _num_ visits over months .
appalling conditions .
they run the place more like a business rather than a care facility .
the first time , they gave me a whole grilled jalapeno .
they got the onions , cheese , and bacon right though .
the people working here are very friendly if not a little disconnected .
i ordered a whataburger with cheese and onion rings and a small drink .
food !
after one bit of my grilled chicken sandwich , i instantly regretted going here .
it was disgusting .
whataburger is n't .
gross .
still awful .
how the heck could anybody like this place ?
_num_ stars because it is n't mcdonalds , although mcdonalds has better buns .
slow as hell .
i was really excited to finally try whataburger .
i made an appointment for _num_ pm on a friday for my friend .
crap .
then from out of nowhere the stylists son starts going off the handle .
evil happens .
we left _num_ hours later .
it was disgusting .
the chips were stale .
so why only two star ?
the window in my room looked into the backyard of someone 's home .
this time it was not .
no roaches there .
we also use this place to cater meal for our late working employees .
the catered food was a lot better than my burrito .
it 's too bad .
friendly staff too !
it 's not that great .
it was dry and it tasted like paper .
very off .
actually , nothing it the burro was the least bit warm .
big mistake .
i consider myself to have an iron gut , too .
not cool .
what is so hard about having the whole thing heated through ?
i am from mexico , and even the street restaurants are better than this .
the red sauce has sooo much flour in it you could taste it .
disgusting .
not good .
i can get pass the decor if the food was good .
from my experience tonight , the rumors may be true .
not so here .
i got the shredded chicken and the carnitas tacos .
soft corn tortillas , of course .
and the rice still tasted more steamed than fried .
i have not been back since .
not impressed whatsoever .
everything here tasted a little off , and it was very expensive .
not a fan .
the chicken egg roll was very greasy .
my main dish was the cashew chicken .
gross , gross , gross .
thats mongolian beef for the ghetto house of hong kong .
this is not chinese food .
my third timing coming .
i will not be back .
i ordered the shrimp lo mein with lobster sauce .
mmm , sounds yummy but the ramen noodles just blew it for me .
the place could use a little updating and tlc .
downright horrendous .
worst customer service ever .
i want to see my doctor in a white coat .
people die in surgery centers .
i was exhausted , had been out of work for several weeks .
was facing back surgery and trying to find a surgeon .
not so fast .
it 's $ _num_ people .
this is a disgrace .
i 'm giving welcome diner _num_ star for the service .
disgusting .
the burger was dry and not tasty .
what a disappointment .
not only was the grilled cheese hot , it was also extremely small .
pathetic .
not my favorite , but fries are fries .
we will not be back .
would i be back ?
yes , an hour and forty total .
brutal .
poorly done .
total should have been _num_ bucks .
drinking , drinking , drinking .
there is zero energy .
no talking .
no laughing .
was i expecting too much ?
this is clearly where strippers go to die .
the place was surprisingly active for a wednesday afternoon .
i dont think i 'd ever get a dance here .
Neutral
even the overpriced bourbon street would be a better bet than this .
on name alone we had to check this place out , just for kicks .
it was time to leave ... quickly .
!
yes , this place is hood .
it is a random thursday , and have waited an hour now .
completely unbelievable !
total cost _num_ .
day of surgery they had two male assistance that flew in from cali .
total and epic fail .
she is certainly not in the correct profession .
they saw me april _num_ , _num_ .
this visit was nothing more than q & a .
i lost it .
tears would not stop .
it was pretty gross .
i wonder if they are having trouble with thier managers .
what a horrible horrible place .
i had _num_ of weed in my car .
since they have the power to refuse service to their customers , be careful !
so , the plan was to drop off the car after work on friday .
it is not a dentist office !
are you kidding me ?
zero stars indeed !
used this company through my appliance warranty .
but again , it was repaired and it was repaired properly .
not at all true .
i called american ice machines , they send out a technician the same day .
do n't deal with these people if you have a choice .
upon leaving he left all the boxes and packing materials in the kitchen .
big avoid !
first , i dropped off my dress blues uniform on a wednesday afternoon .
i was pissed .
first of all you have to leave your purse at the counter .
the only place i have ever seen this before was asu 's bookstore .
no sorry .
_num_ % of the stock was stuffed toys and dog clothing .
this time _num_ cans were defective .
cons : abysmal customer service .
terrible .
inventory control needs some help .
is ridiculous !
it 's been _num_ days !
it broke off after them using to sheer _num_ lamb !
by taking too much of the outside covering off .
cost was too expensive .
the salsa was just ok .
very disappointing .
i called their _num_ number , got the call center in phoenix , az .
the not so sweet donuts with icing all tasted the same !
zero flavor !
how incredibly pathetic .
not here .
it felt more like an overpriced museum .
never getting out of their seats at any point of our visit .
whatever .
i was so excited to check out this store .
i am very upset that i was billed almost twice what they quoted me .
do n't rely on them scheduling you correctly .
very very disappointing .
everytime i would go they had someone new .
the following morning i had emergency surgery to save my son .
current phoenix sales tax is _num_ % and we were being charged _num_ % .
my taco and tostada were just alright .
what a disappointment !
my wife tried the huevos rancheros , which were okay , not terrific .
i had the two enchiladas and shredded taco plate , about $ _num_ .
gut bomb was more like it .
my daughter had two shredded beef tacos for $ _num_ , filling .
nothing `` special '' at all about any of the items .
i think i could have made a better one myself .
stopped in here for lunch on our first day in phoenix .
ice cold corona 's at $ _num_ a pop .
the sign on the door says they close at _num_ pm .
this place always runs out of items on the menu .
never smiles .
avoid the water .
but this one is always short staffed .
i was there for a late lunch ( 2:30 ) .
come on , people , fix up the place - okay ?
we just walked out .
she cleaned off a table and sat us .
never going back !
i 've gone to better restaurants with a smaller bill and more food .
horrible horrible horrible service !
was n't even busy today !
no more .
the prescriptions are not filled when promised .
horrible place .
tomato soup with basil , good flavour but to course in texture .
around the same time we ordered a bottle of wine .
something is wrong here .
the building itself is adorable .
from a very snobby waitress , i was immediately put off .
nothing was bad .
nothing was stellar .
when i called , i thought i was lucky to have reached the owner .
chefs can have an off day and food can turn , i get it .
just weird .
wait , nope .
hot dogs = terrible .
two attempts to get the food we ordered .
not a smooth running process .
shame !
no french fries ?
carrot and raisin salad on the menu ?
they need to just scrub the place down .
everything else sucked .
and yes , i tried this place a couple times wanting to like it .
and no fries ?
dry , flavorless , terrible .
how hard is it to make a chicken sandwich taste good ?
musty is chic now ? )
_num_ in phoenix is like _num_ in boston .
burgers , hot dogs and cold sandwiches .
it looked equally disgusting .
this was my third time and probably last .
the service was terrible .
big mistake .
why _num_ star ?
it was dreadful .
can not comment on food as we only tried the shakes .
first impression : bad .
service : terrible .
the wait staff was young and in need of training .
dude , just write it down !
you 'd think with those prices the service would be much better .
i was severely disappointed .
the service was not good .
the icecream was something you could buy at the grocery store .
bought a groupon and used # _num_ of _num_ .
ordered a cheeseburger , potato salad another bacon cheeseburger and hawaiian coleslaw .
the cheeseburgers were frozen patties and cooked clean into next week .
waitress was not friendly either .
no french fries !
potato salad , chips , coleslaw , carrot raisin salad .
however , the hard boiled egg was food service .
meats were the cheapest of the cheap .
this is a very short window .
the place really needs a good cleaning before i will go back again .
stopped on on my lunch break which was during their rush .
sincerely disappointed .
this was disappointing .
i think overall , i will try another place before i came back here .
i had a great visit here .
i had a craving for ice cream so tried this .
great idea , but cleanliness is not a thing here at all !
and the menu is n't online .
a little too dusty for my liking .
there are some sides offered like potato salad for example which was tasty .
i had the `` bird '' , which was a turkey burger .
i hate that taste .
very flat .
ok , i 'm all for dive bars .
they have limited hours .
no way !
over rated !
very reasonably priced .
orders ... .
wrong !
i went to ranch market !
they also only usually have one register open or _num_ max .
but there are several checkout lanes .
this is a _num_ minute job to do !
do n't use this location .
the other thing i had problem with was their free wifi .
it actually opened another room .
gross overall .
very noisy .
i visit phoenix frequently and this is my first stay at this location .
sufficient .
the pool and hot tub have a very , very rough bottom .
it was a friday night , maybe we 'll try again on a weekday .
at _num_ pm , we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices .
we both got ceviche apps , which were pretty good .
not sure ) .
not return .
i 'm not from here and was looking or some authentic mexican food .
service was slow .
margarita was weak .
bad dream .
they did n't taste fresh either .
disappointed .
the wait for the food was long as well .
the place is very small feels very crowded especially with the band .
Neutral
terrible servers .
as soon as we got our food they brought out the bill .
horrible service .
as for the food the chips and salsa were on point .
my girlfriend and i bought a car here in may .
`` if it is broke , just ignore it .
over $ _num_ to get it fixed .
not trustworthy !
i ca n't imagine doing this to people every day .
overall not a good experience .
i came home , shut the alarm off and went back to work .
worst customer service ever !
it 's too bad .
poor customer service .
there were signs at the entry pointing wedding guests where they should go .
garden scheduled to work until _num_ pm .
they should let people know before selling tickets to them .
what the desert botanical garden has is desert .
the desert botanical garden is just desert .
and i 'll go for a hike .
i second the other reviewer that does n't `` get '' this park .
they should decide whether they are gardens or a wedding venue .
!
sooo not worth it !
i 've been there many times , and this is the case every .
seems the non jeweler has the place figured out .
and said how `` much more advanced '' she was than that .
appalling service .
she was just rude .
i walked out !
mario is an accommodating , polite , gentleman who appreciates your business .
i quickly paid and left .
i went into this store yesterday buying all supplies needed to make jewelry .
this is completely unacceptable .
agree with the other two in regards to this subway .
not here .
very disappointing .
two words .
they leave ash trays everywhere for anyone to smoke .
it was disgusting !
i 'm glad i 'm only here two nights .
it 's not .
that 's ridiculous !
there are two positives .
not the best hilton property i stayed at .
find another hilton in phoenix if you can .
needs a major remodel and cleaning job !
come on , hilton , get your act together !
my family and i checked into the room just fine .
( there was a high school band staying at the hotel ) .
no a/c that works .
glad we left , never again !
two thumbs down .
i could have cooked better fish .
the pupusas were crazy delicious though .
i would totally return for these .

my husband and i had lunch here on one of his day 's off .
they are down to the owners wife as the server .
there to go order was ready before my dine in order .
i figured i could find a place with better customer service .
horrible !
nothing to brag about .
no thank you .
why is everyone standing around ?
i had my car serviced here .
after all , they 're yelp reviews are nothing but raving fans .
a trusted , hard working , friendly auto business .
so i believe him and they fix it too .
i went there for a tire patch on my rear left tire .
i walk to the employee area he went to and waited .
only in phoenix .
if this is how they make them now ... um ... alright .
pretzel dogs with bacon and cheese are suppose to have bacon bits .
goodbye forever , sonic .
i know it 's sonic , but c'mon .
it 's called low lights people .
if she was guilty she would be in prison right now .
what i mean is - this is _num_ - the age of technology .
bad form !
bad form !
bad .
terrible service .
worst customer service ever .
i can hear conversations from my downstairs neighbors like i was in their apartment .
huge mistake .
i have been paying online the entire two years and it 's been fine .
hate !
Negative
the laundry room is always in deplorable conditions .
waste of time !
there is another autozone location on 40th st. and thomas which is far better .
when they are in between , everything is shut off .
one of the times , they went right past me at the meeting point .
but i wish i stayed at the double tree .
not , even your normal cockroaches but , gigantic cockroaches .
this restaurant probably has to be the most overrated india eatery in arizona !
have to agree with elizabeth l. about getting some good indian food in phoenix !
they did n't seem very friendly .
in my opinion , indian food is not a cheap venture .
the quantity was so little for the price and it was really salty .
not lamb ? ''
terrible .
terrible .
terrible .
i visited this restaurant with a phoenix dining card and never got my discount .
i took some friends to try indian food for the first time .
no apologies .
you 've been warned .
i went to this place on my trip to arizona and phoenix .
just awful .
went in at _num_ pm on a sunday .
second , the _num_ % was added on for the lunch buffet .
i basically just at the chicken marsala and rice , which i enjoyed .
they put green and red bell peppers in the indian food !
i could n't believe it .
they seem to stock old beer .
mediocre food .
the chicken curry was really salty and reheated from that day 's lunch buffet .
if you are indian you will regret it .
it was yellow rice with some boiled chicken some sliced jalapeo and tomato slice .
being that this was a specialty you would think it would be pretty good .
yes , tough chicken .
cold , stale food .
bad service .
never ever going back .
this place is a homeless shelter .
after i insisted , they sent someone to pick it up .
not a huge selection of books .
do n't park your car here while traveling .
hotel staff and bus driver said this has happened numerous times .
dingy , dirty , depressing .
it 's the many room problems which bring my ratings down .
what a terrible visit !
the bathroom was a scene out of a horror film .
after entering my room i went straight to the bed and sat down .
then i walked into the bathroom .
that is why i 'm writing this review .
sketchy .
they serve drinks just like anywhere else .
there were lots of blue collar workers just getting off work and relaxing .
the drinks were cheap , darts were fun .
not much has changed .
the two women who greeted and served us were fine i guess .
but the crust was like shoe leather .
overall probably would n't come back .
the food was awful .
who serves potato skins without sour cream ) .
we had a half pepperoni , half veggie .
lame .
i 'm not going back .
zero atmosphere .
the salad is standard bagged mix greens and bottled dressing .
anyway , they bring out our desserts first !
it 's too bad .
i would recommend the food just get it to go .
it was _num_ minutes .
did i mention i was with my mother and _num_ month old baby ?
we put in orders for waters and _num_ beers .
my wife ordered some fried mushrooms and zucchini .
below average to pretty bad .
finally our food came out n the manager gave us _num_ % off .
such a shame !
new management is clueless !
this place sucks .
if anyone told you otherwise , they were lying .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ the bathroom situation is chaos .
the seating is extremely close from one another and the rows are crowded .
i will not be back !
nothing besides tell us to stop `` making trouble '' .
this venue is awful .
it 's a little inconvenient .
we went with a group of people to watch some fights .
place was filled with smoke .
obviously terribly managed !
obviously , the facility expected us to buy drinks while we waited .
not good customer service !
awful .
reason for _num_ stars ?
... not a good first impression .
horrible .
however , it needs some serious attention .
my seat was very lumpy .
ridiculous .
hot as hell too .
too small and hot .
over all glad i went because it was heart .
people were taking up _num_ parking spaces .
it feels more like a big bar than a concert hall .
with your friends and have a party , this might be for you .
no water fountains inside .
just trying to not pass out during my two hours here , you know ?
maybe the fact that it took them three weeks to get artwork to me .
my story sounds very similar to the ones posted on here already .
you 've been warned .
it was way to hot , and it was microwaved !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
sorry , no dice .
nothing ever happens .
not to mention they 're overpriced .
please feel free to contact me before you consider renting here .
courtney village fails .
there were tons of water bugs that would come up daily in the pipes .
bad really bad start .
horrible place !
this was the same story and situation the past _num_ times we stayed here .
slept ok , the bed was fine .
no more again .
this motel is terrible .
the last few times , it 's just been kind of `` meh '' .
ten years ago this was the bomb !
there are probably _num_ spots and most of them fill up pretty quickly .
the bbq sandwiches at honey bear 's never seem to impress me though .
out of forks , out of salad ?
waited _num_ min for cold food ?
i 'm never eating there again .
i 'm confused .
but honey bears has a _num_ star rating .
hot links were very average .
terrible texture .
honestly , i 've made better bbq at home .
pork was dry .
not too impressed .
coleslaw was only tolerable , to soupy and peppery .
the food was lousy .
the sauce was weak .
this place really needs an overhaul .
mediocre at best !
horrible experience .
very disappointed .
cashier was n't friendly .
food is just okay , but it is to expensive for what you get .
not real impressed .
wo n't be back .
did they change owners ?
lunch at honey bears bbq today .
what a disappointment .
the food was n't very tasty .
highly disappointed .
having not heard of it , i was in for it .
went in today with my friend .
i 'm done with this place and not visiting this again .
would not recommend .
to start the mac and cheese was so off base .
cold .
the guy just did n't care .
the chicken was disgusting .
it was dry , the outside was hard .
the ribs were inconsistent .
beer was cheap and cold at _num_ for a bud lite .
the corn on the cobb was hot but old .
beans were good , as was the mac and cheese .
i would get potato salad instead of mac & cheese if we return there .
by the looks of it only the reviewers care .
i got the bbq chicken and my guest got the bbq pulled pork .
the chicken did not taste fresh .
presentation was horrible !
i am jeff and i call em as i see em !
very gross !
so giving a _num_ , but i would like to make it a _num_ .
i guess it was a zoo of rocks n sticks .
yes , that must be it .
how gross ! ''
maybe i missed it .
i 've never seen anything like that before .
it 's way too hot .
what a horrible idea !
a small salad costs $ _num_ .
a bottle of water is $ _num_ .
yes , i 'm complaining about the cost of two adults .
this is primarily a hot weather zoo .
$ _num_ for a hot dog !
did n't see much !
take your money elsewhere .
it was ok , but just ok .
i would suggest heading west to the wildlife world zoo .
for adults , not much to see and the zoo itself is small .
not worth it .
the animals are old , often hiding behind something .
it is highly over priced .
food was not the best .
a regular ticket does n't include much except walking around .
who was working the front gate called me a dick .
even the seasonal ( yes , summer items ) were closed .
just way to high and not nearly enough bang for the buck .
poorly done .
disappointment !
some animals were out but most were not .
big deal when it 's _num_ degrees out .
also with many of the exhibits closed it was a bit pricey .
would not recommend !
just relocated to phoenix so we thought we would try out the zoo .
general adult admission $ _num_ .
we spent _num_ 1/2 hrs walking around and never really got excited .
basically , the letter that was sent to us was bs bs bs !
very _num_ .
not so much here .

i do n't need good customer service .
i do n't need to eat in a safe neighborhood .

it 's a lot more like _num_ .
terrible customer service .

the room was n't the cleanest .
avoid if possible !
the environment was very sketchy and unsafe .

unfortunately not .
i purchased the full detail $ _num_ and hand wax $ _num_ .

the menu was unimpressive .
it was the most generic chinese menu i 've seen .
_num_ .
this place claims to be an authentic shanghai restaurant but it was so americanized .
the food itself was more like seafood soup .
may be i was expecting too much .
the food ... was passable but not amazing .
i 've had great chinese food but this was just okay .
i will not be returning again .
ugh .

ancient chinese secret my ass .
and she had the nerve to check my body for needles marks .
this is strange for a place that was built around the pharmacy business .
but these were christmas presents and i needed them tonight .
no hello .
a man at the hotel the first night had reservations too .
the decisions were made above her .
terrible service .
too much !
windows were covered in a film that we cleaned off while filling the tank .
very difficult to see out while in reverse .
my mom was coming into town to visit and wanted to hire a car .
what a mistake .
i will never rent here again !
so bad !

the chile relleno seemed as if it was stuffed a few days prior .
worse service ever !
no .
just ... no .
horrible .
_num_ cents each .
the asada was in big , tough pieces .
pastor was literally chunks of ground pork .
i ca n't .
we walk in the door , are seated , and handed the simple menu .
nothing of interest on the menu .
tried the kung pao shrimp and veg chow mien .
service was also not good .
not satisfied .
the menu looked alright , like a typical small chinese restaurant .
wo n't go again .
flavorless .
we 're so disappointed .
i went to this restaurant with a group of seven other coworkers .
it was at lunchtime , so the place was a little busy .
man , we were really looking forward to this .
i arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately .
average to a little less than average .
rice was a tad dry .
went in and was promptly seated .
we also had to wait a bit long for the food order .
soup was nothing special .
cold salad next to hot entree next to hot rice .
check was delivered halfway through meal .
horrible experience .
it was water boiled spicy beef .
tip for the owners this is america , not china .
went with an open mind to try something new and out of the ordinary .
the worst experience ever .
will never return here .
cantonese is sweeter with a semi thick sauce .
limited english staff .
would never step foot in that place again .
this was my first time at sp .
it really worries me when food comes out that fast .
horrible !
do n't recommend .
yes disgusting .
the owners should be ashamed .
walked in , host seating us without any greeting .
gross !
but i guess that is what sells ... .
so sad ... .
gross !
named a sichuan palace but taste like panda express .
chicken : the chicken pieces were tiny and the breading was way excessive .
i tasted very little chicken and the sauce was drenched in vinegar .
i am not a patient .
this is unacceptable !
this place is horrible .
hotel is rather nasty .
curtains were ill fitting , going over the window a/c heater system and blowing .
but no .
we got into the room , which was spacious and mostly clean .
just awful .
lesson learned , eh jay ?
and there were some bright spots .
very disappointed !
get in your _num_ degree car and drive down to jack in the box .
apparently they were short staffed so the `` waitress '' was doing a delivery .
the car charger will definitely be useful .
i also had to wait a few days to get my phone .
it was more than the _num_ day delivery that they advertise .
she is just a worker standing by the door like you .
i thought i was buying that from costco .
turns out i was n't .
i guess that 's fine for a regular car , but not for mine .
diet coke , allergy meds and giant bags of frozen chicken breast .
they completely stop paying attention to what 's going on around them .
wan na know why ?
no thanks .
lots of inappropriate comments .
we already hate it here and we just joined .
big mistake .
you only get one chance to make a good first impression .
terrible .
no flavor .
the one thing that kept me going back was their deals on tires .
the first time was last summer and i just felt ill all over .
finally they wrote me a prescription and i was on my way .
husband went about a year ago .
she is a navy veteran , served in war and everything .
this actually looks like some sort of bite !
horrible experience !
horrible experience .
online system says check in to reserve your spot .
only one other patient was there , and one other showed up after us .

what i got was a charred hockey puck .
btw , i can not figure out why two reviews are filtered .
they seem on the up and up .
i would recomend going here just for the experience .
not my cup of tea .
definitely a place to frequent if you `` want to be left alone '' .
i will not go back .
not a sweet tomatoes that 's for sure .
watery mac n cheese .
the soup is not hot , like it should be .
service- nonexistent .
the food just was n't that good .
it just tasted really cheap .
the ice cream ( or frozen yogurt ) machine was out of service .
ok , so i had the $ _num_ lunch .
tomatoes do not sweat .
had to ask for it , same with pizza .
however , i was definitely let down by this location .
be very careful .
i simply ordered a veggie and cheese .
... ... end result ... .
poor service .
how funny the owners name is `` mike s '' !
pretty terrible experience here .
but most applebee 's i 've frequented have been decent .
spinach & artichoke appetizer was so-so .
not much flavor .
my wife had the blackened chicken & penne pasta .
he insisted on having our names just to take our order .
he was very friendly but it was to the point of intrusive .
when i ordered my food he insisted that i order something different .
i guess that does n't apply !
do not eat here .
terrible .
i do n't like this location .
i drive further down the road just for the better service .
we have to flag him down .
i order baby c some steamed broccoli and a juice .
j 's and my food come out as ordered .
drinks ... he 's on the ball with refills of my water .
but misses the mark with j 's root beer refill .
wrong !
however , things have changed and standards seem to be much lower .
fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside .
service was quick , except for the replacement meal taking forever .
they both have more responsible employees & managers that care .
to wait too long .
servers were rude .
why the hell ?
not a chance .
only been to applebee 's a few times but never this location .
too slow .
so they are not too busy making food .
i like to talk to the person or people i am dining with .
service is sloppy .
food is bad .
worst experience .
he had _num_ beer prior .
i guess the cooks like everything rare !
the chicken was ... dry .
the wings were ... dry .
such a shame .
food is mediocre .
so nasty !
never again stepping foot in this place !
it 's pretty ridiculous .
not good !
i hate you .
that 's me .
only frozen meat , one type of sausage .
walking into macayo 's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a vegas casino .
tacky , tacky , tacky .
i really like the mini chicken chimichangas .
essentially , macayo 's is one of the staple eateries of phoenix .
total with tip & free delivery was about $ _num_ .
its hard to find anything under $ _num_ .
the food ( even the side of veggies ) was sooo greasy and fatty .
i regret eating here .
-- salsa _num_ to _num_ days old .
shame on you !
-- refried beans go the same way .
did n't finish them ?
just throw in a bit of lard and put 'em back on the fire .
-- sopapillas for shame !
_num_ .
_num_ .
before we can open our mouth to remedy this he is gone .
i have never done that before .
cheese , refried beans , tomatoes , sour cream and guacamole .
the carpeting is tired .
overpriced , stale fast-food .
but the black slimy stuff on the red pepper , what was that ?
never waited very long , 1st steak fajitas seems fine .
drinks are expensive .
service is awful .
macayos is like chuck e. cheese without the games .
here , you just kind of bang your own head on the table .
music too loud .
too ethnic .
i had the steak fajitas and my date had shrimp fajitas .
the chimichanga was awful .
huge , but awful .
it was soggy and bland .
eh ... no .
the cheese crisp should be skipped .
there 's no flavor .
chicken chimichanga was ok .
went to macayo 's on central last night for dinner .
huge mistake .
this clearly does n't describe this place .
that would paint a picture like bob ross on this damn place .
do n't worry ... hunger is that last thing on my mind .
no , no , no , no .
for the prices they charge , you have a right to expect better food .
that was a mistake .
she requests another spoon - again - and my daughter requests one as well .
i really expected it to be better .
burned cheese crisp .
my husband had the macayo tour meal and the portions were very small .
horrible graduation dinner .
i 've been to eat better places at lower prices .
the outside of the building drew me in but the inside needs an overhaul .
the place itself needs to be remodeled .
we only saw our waiter perhaps _num_ times the entire evening .
Negative
so we get seated and still had to wait forever for chips and drinks .
i 'm never returning to this macayos !
not anymore !
this place has a serious staffing problem .
poor service , dirty restroom .
bland is a complement .
taco bell has more seasonings .
gave me _num_ % discount .
not to the one on central .
swing and miss !
there was n't a second bite .
the service is just downright mean .
i have been here twice , year 's apart .
but this burrito was practically swimming with it .
i could n't eat more than half .
i 'm sure i will have to call them back , again .
it was awful .
attended the `` graduation '' night after being pressured into going .
just an old embassy suites type hotel at a higher rate .
bad choice .
i 'd suggest a lower room , especially in the summer .
_num_ stars for them and _num_ for the night staff .
so disappointed .
very loud hotel .
the pool also never had towels .
ugh where to begin ?
outdated decor everywhere .
Negative
i could smell them cooking bacon in the morning .
maybe someone that eats meat would appreciate this but to me ... yuk !
they 're getting _num_ stars only for customer service .
it was a little pricey , but the meals were prepared correctly .
the second sandwich was another veggie .
i threw it away .
delivery service is ridiculous .
i received neither .
worst service ever .
this place sucks .
all this hype for nothing .
_num_ .
i wasnt expecting whole foods , but really , whats the point ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
why not just go to fry 's or safeway ?
the same exact stuff you get at safeway for more $ .
_num_ corned beef steak remains .
about _num_ pounds .
-- nothing else .
_num_ stars for the awesome beer selection .
the stuffing , gravy , and yams were pretty good .
i went to the deli area to get breakfast .
management obviously does n't follow up with complaints properly as well .
the crust was just so tough .
my friend gave me said flowers because i was having a rough pain day .
its overpriced junk .
not anymore .
overpriced junk food .
it 's ridiculous .
basically ruined .
lame .
really bad experience today .
aj 's fails at this nearly every time i go .
virtually every time i go there , i have an experience like that .
i 'll be avoiding going back .
one star is too many .
i stopped at aj 's twice this week for lunch .
just an insane amount of meat between two slices of bread .
do n't forget to bring your attitude when you shop .
never had customer service like this .
the deli people and the man serving the pizza were down right assholes .
also hoping they would take care of me somehow in this situation .
they were watery and barely edible .
lastly , guys that ringing noise you hear is a phone .
horrible !
when we got our new wings they looked a million times better .
they were golden and smothered in some of the same weird sauce .
my boyfriend ordered a philly i ordered raviolis .
just not edible !
the pizza crust is rubber and just strange tasting !
toppings were not fresh at all .
i love me some broasted chicken , so in i went to investigate .
i was disappointed .
it was $ _num_ per topping .
my pizza was over $ _num_ .
um , wtf ?
not cool !
soggy , and no sauce .
... however sometimes you get what you pay for .
this is the second time i have had a problem at this store .
the first round of drinks was fine .
but we had to be rather obvious to get refills .
the little bread appetizers was a plus .
i did not like the soup .
we stopped in last night after driving around trying to find a place .
worst place ever .
ordered once and got really old chicken and fries .
the wings were gross .
the wings were dry and overlooked .
ick food .
my suggesting here , is not to order the individual slices .
it wo n't happen .
taste was just fair .
wings were cold .
customer service was horrible .
they refused .
this was unacceptable .
i do n't remember if he actually got his food first .
this del taco even makes taco bell seem like four star dining !
more like mediocre burrito !
no such luck .
closed up lights off .
it 's fucking stupid !
i receive them , and they 're skimpy like taco bell !
only a last resort .

i could n't agree more .
seating is not available at typical eating times and lines may be long .
fifth and finally , the bread is hard to eat .
this was would be a nice side salad , not a lunch .
so a hit and a two misses .
but , recently they seem to have quality control issues .
not the savory taste i 'm looking for with a chicken salad sandwich .
so , we had similarly high expectations for the pane bianco cafe .
we were disappointed .
not kid friendly !
why not just make something that tastes good ?
whenever i get to phoenix , i always stop by for some bread .
went for dinner on a tuesday at _num_ pm ( july _num_ ) .
ummmm that 's weird , but fine .
not cool .
this place is foul .
disappointing & unfriendly staff .
they should stick to pizza !
i ordered the monday sandwich of the day and a pizza for my son .
the food was cold .
it was unremarkable .
i sat down at a table .
i visited g & d during the light rail pub crawl .
when we walked in , my crew headed straight to the bar .
then i had to yell to her that we were ready .
i 'll try that if i ever visit g & d again .
it 's at minimum a heavy vinegar / buffalo sauce , thai chilis ?
for this and the cider alone i 'm returning .
the entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building .
on another night , the scotch eggs followed the same theme .
nothing about it said restaurant .
steak 'n kidney pie = where was the kidney ?
!
menu for food was quite typical .
Negative
recently i have noticed a big down turn in the staff at this pub .
it 's just not fun anymore .
so long , george .
as i could see there was one bartender and one waitress .
it 's a dark bar , my date liked the english vibe of it .
i 've just been to better karaoke bars ( i.e .
before we could ask for waters our server ran away .
our wait staff was non existent .
it tasted like water before .
the waitress was awful .
but the service was inexcusable .
wo n't be back .
but time has not been kind to this place .
avoid this place .
terrible service .
that we were here there were several tables that never got cleared .
there certainly were a lot of regulars ( not ordering food ... ) .
such a shame .
stopped by last for dinner while on a biz trip to phoenix .
i ca n't order from the bar .
she would n't even bring me my card .
let me get up , go to the bar and wait .
wo n't be back .
not only this visit , several past visits .
servers too busy chatting , hiding , you name it .
seems like management is non existent .
too bad .
rude .
probably will not be back .
george and dragon sucks .
if i could give less i would .
the butt end and that was it .
fire your entire kitchen staff and start over , or just stop serving food .
our food did n't arrive for _num_ mins .
could a fooled me !
most miserable worst experience ever .
looking forward to going here for weeks , big let down .
mashed potatoes and cold bits of hamburger .
ridiculous .
they are consistency awful .
would not recommend .
waitress brought out a drink with water and ice .
she really though scotch comes on the rocks by default .
really does n't matter .
i 'm not coming back .
damn shame .
a bit disappointed .
sunday noon , about _num_ patrons .
very disappointed .
i said nothing and walked .
.
these people are idiots .
places like this seem to have a really difficult staffing problem .
horrible service , horrible attitudes .
it was very disappointing .
awkward and slow .
just went here to discuss getting some items printed .
just absolutely frustrating .
my stylist greeted me and immediately complemented me on my necklace .
i could have saved myself $ _num_ and gone to super cuts .
i assume it is to get you hooked and come back .
not happening .
i would not recommend this place .
no thanks .
really now , get over yourself .
he is rude and arrogant .
there 's too much junk otherwise .
he needs to put the lamp shade on and turn on the light !
he does n't even deserve _num_ star .
treats grown ups like little children .
yikes , run !
how disappointing .
i 'm disappointed .
my former studio definitely had a smell but it was nothing like this .
_num_ .
this place does not even deserve a one star !
so rude !
horrible .
sick .
this place simply nasty .
he then walks off .
stay far far away !
this place is an absolute joke .
take the time to put tape on your box before dropping off !
i do n't keep packing tape at home because i do n't ship much .
they were nice though .
so i left .
everyone ( including eric , the owner ) were friendly and helpful .
he said it was the way i rode it .
i wore my station hat in the pig .
eric became all sorts of friendly and helpful .
buy your bike else where , like tempe bikes .
the brake pads perhaps , they were different , but the tube ?
that was disappointing .
i meant to add this just after i wrote the entry .
it was true for the whole short week since i purchased it from walmart .
i get it , you 're busy .
the point is , that when i went there , they started from scratch .
so i 've been to every bike shop in town .
but back to the pig .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
in the past _num_ weeks , i stopped by the shop _num_ times .
unbelievable .
ignore me three times , get _num_ star on yelp .
bang bang bang bang !
not so !
if you want to be treated like sh*t , this is the place .
terrible !
hubby insisted we had eaten here before .
i ordered the taco salad for my lunch .
what a disappointment !
we left full , the food run of the mill .
the staff all seems to be in some other world though .
Neutral
it 's _num_ , time update your menu & restaurant .
friend _num_ had an even more crispy looking omelet .
friend _num_ got a turkey sandwich .
check your cold storage bins people !
friend _num_ has a major strawberry allergy .
boy was i wrong .
how disappointing .
no surprise .
service sucked .
then the waitress just continued to disappear over and over again .
my gf decided french toast was fine .
i tell him to go away and get me someone else to help .
very unfortunate customer service .
now i remember why we switched to home depot paint .
`` nobody 's ever ordered one of those here before . ''
and even that was n't good .
just do n't go there to eat .
garbage .
alright , whatever .
he does n't .
i grab them , and ask where my candy is .
i did n't care .
they are just dumb .
and if i were reviewing just the store i would say it was fantastic .
he let out another sigh .
says there 's nothing he can do .
in september of _num_ my vehicle was damaged by a tree in their property .
not that great in volleyball .
aaron brothers we 're overpriced mart .
aaron brothers you 'll never see thomas s. again mart .
aaron brothers got your ass yelped on yelp mart .
i purchased a _num_ x _num_ print recently that i planned on framing .
she informed me that it could be ready july 30th , exactly one month .
i did notice that there were two employees present and one customer , me .
no surprises there .
avoid this place !
the service was horrible !
this place needs better service .
she invited me in her comment to try another salon .
no thanks .
worst customer service ever .
such a rude rude rude woman .
now have to wait until monday to get my car .
wendy 's of _num_ e indian school , i hope you read this .
so incredibly gross .
so gross .
gross .
every time i go here , i order the same thing .
it really was n't busy .
this is getting ridiculous .
yes i know the food never looks like it does in the commercials .
but they have baked potatoes .
what other fast food joint has baked potatoes ?
they 're out of baked potatoes .
not spicy at all .
the management was none too concerned .
there is almost a screw up every time .
but wait ... did you call the desk after talking to the dr ?
what a nightmare !
it does however take me awhile to get an appointment .
are these the kind of employees the phoenix va have as support staff ?
worst customer service ever !
it 's _num_ months between appointments .
this review honestly does n't include the va 's er department .
and nobody else will , '' ( lie number _num_ ) .
this place is an absolute joke .
the blood draw itself took under _num_ seconds total .
the parking is ridiculous .
this place really need to be more organized .
a week later i get a call to bring the copies .
a week later i get a call to come in and discuss it .
however the va system cant provide the medical care that i need .
he was very thorough and was constantly typing while asking me questions .
slight language barrier , i think he is of russian descent .
_num_ weeks later .
pros : the corn bread , green beans , and creamed spinach were delicious .
that is totally unacceptable !
fast food salad , pasta and pizza .
for years , i had passed by but was never impressed by their menu .
went there for lunch and had a chicken chopped salad .
or maybe i just had my taste buds set for lemon chicken .
it also cost more than it should .
the staff was friendly , i mean at least they smiled .
car stuff 's expensive .
the autozone kid was super helpful though .
autozone has recently changed their battery testing policy and equipment .
could not help me for nothing .
lazy lazy lazy !
no , thanks .
the poor wait staff .
ok , ok , ok , too much of the extras .
skip the entrees .
my fav 's were the spinach dip and the wings .
the chips tasted freshly made but were a little greasy for my liking .
so , i ate there on wednesday and it is now friday .
waited _num_ min .
wrong idea .
will never i back .
horrible .
unable to eat .
left without eating .
just horrible .
worst experience !
last i checked i 'm pretty sure that was the servers job .
food was disgusting .
was not happy with the food !
on july 2nd , _num_ , we visited this applebee 's .
he brought us _num_ napkins & _num_ forks .
that is unacceptable .
once seated , we then wait for our waiter to arrive .
none have ever been great .
it tasted bad .
our meal was ruined .
staff was friendly , restaurant was moderately clean .
after much discussion they cooked another egg .
this place is ridiculous .
meal was overall gross !
it 's unacceptable .
_num_ percent chance this is me .
it 's terrible .
stopped in here a few months back .
one left to ring a customer up and came back .
i was waiting on you .
i went to cheese 'n stuff to buy cheese and the choices were laughable .
one of the deli cases actually just had chips in it .
well folks , you yelpers here are totally fooled !
it 's not !
for starters , my friend and i ordered sizzling rice soup .
it was very meh .
it was very bland .
a lot of people from work seem to like to go here .
after being there several times i still dont get what the fuss is .
i ordered the orange chicken , fried rice , soup , and crab puffs .
over priced mediocre food .
i was dissatisfied with this place after reading all the rave reviews .
pork fried rice , lemon chicken , and sweet and sour chicken .
sweet and sour chicken .
after everything i 'd heard of the place , i was expecting alot more .
will not be back .
i have eaten in restaurant only a handful of times .
i had kung pao chicken and my wife had lemon chicken .
i like it spicey but this was just sour .
nasty !
another disappointment .
this is direct cause and effect .
i only ate _num_ or _num_ bites .
the sesame chicken was the same way .
i was not impressed at all .
i had sweet and sour chicken , pork fried rice and wonton soup .
nothing to write home about .
it did n't wow me .
oh no no no no !
i will not be back !
i ordered the teriyaki chicken spicy and the crab puffs .
not good at all .
the crab puffs were awesome .
i will not be returning though .
the food is underwhelming !
food was horrible .
they get five star 's it was the food .
nothing i would order again its clear they have a loyal customer base .
rather get of pf changs or pei wei .
even panda express does n't use msg .
it 's bad stuff .
watered down sauce .
something has changed big time !
find a better florist , they 're out there .
will not be using them again .
they were awful .
the baked goods section is full of wraps , pretzels , etc .
no greeting ... nothing .
no offer to help .
they then price them up using various price guides .
not much love for music just about making money .
all i know is that this place smells like old tuna .
the cheap kind .
i just want my dive bars to have some life .
it was amazingly gross .
i will not be returning .
is n't it a buffet ?
the worst ever !
so , i figured i would try it .
it was almost embarrassing being the only asian person in the place .
we went through the drive-thru around 8pm last wednesday .
veggies and chicken were okay too .
i guess the whole bowl was just okay .
the sauce served with them were good though .
all in all , not my dream dinner , but just okay .
i do n't care .
horrible !
over that time the service has declined tremendously .
( referring to a veggie sushi roll item ) .
of course i drove off in a fit and hungry haha .
digging into the teriyaki chicken i found a lot of vegetables and little chicken .
not reputable business .
then again , i wouldnt really consider this a reputable business .
bad idea .
bad business .
what the hell ?
very limited seating .
my only concern was how well they cleaned the blizzard machine .
walked around .
put down papers .
talked to someone else .
wo n't be back .
i dont pay that much money for someone not to do their job .
dont consider it .
what morons , for _num_ months they continued to send mail there .
very unhappy with both .
for _num_ years never one complaint .
he is still not satisfied .
get a better vendor .
hard times , qdoba ?
i need some now .
fail !
automatic low rating .
because i had never been there , i was looking over their menu .
i am going to stick with chipotle all the way .
my first experience with this restaurant will be the only one .
the bagels and cream cheese were good , but not outstanding .
Negative
i am _num_ for _num_ .
ripoff !
bad business !
ok , way out of my price range .
not ethical in my books .
not to mention yogurt etc .
really hurt by the experience .
pathetic !
then why did i pay $ _num_ ?
_num_ stars .
borderline _num_ .
i just was n't impressed .
i thought for sure this would become my home away from home .
probably not .
i wanted to sit in the den , where the brews are crafted .
hardly anyone was there .
the layout of the place was somewhat unusual .
the two beers that i had were decent but not amazing .
the service was awful .
also i noticed the menu was really , really random .
fish and chips , and then some southwestern dishes ... .
the weather was fabulous .
next time i 'll just try sitting at the bar .
wow .
big mistake .
from our three drinks ordered , we only got two .
been here before and it was way better than this last thursday !
no big deal .
my favorites were the hefeweizen and vanilla porter .
the waitress would grab the beer and scoop out the ticket .
i will not be back .
no one even cared .
i really doubt we will return .
not impressed at all .
next time , i 'll buy a _num_ pack and host my own gathering .
unbelievably horrible service .
probably _num_ tortilla chips .
i went here last week with a friend to try it out .
i ordered a large mac n cheese and the garlic parmesan fries .
we chose to try to sit at the other bar .
_num_ .
not cabana .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
not a good vibe at all .
staff was a plus .
never again - not recommended .
it looked cheap .
it is actually tile that looks like dark wood floors .
we thought is was cheap vinyl .
well i got ready to crawl in about _num_ pm .
the bed was awful .
overpriced & horrible housekeeping !
i was not comped .
horrible experience .
property could not fix .
terrible layout .
old , tired property .
_num_ .
_num_ .
not my fault !
- i really liked their chicken noodle soup on the first day .
pro tip : light rail drops you off a block from here .
it could use a renovation .
not good for kids .
not good for dogs .
no apple pay !
methinks not . ''
i wish i had never gone .
Negative
aka they are charging for non existing ink in a tattoo area .
makes no sense .
at least not with the same one ?
so , so unhappy .
that is ridiculous .
this starbucks has been remodeled and now looks like a hospital cafeteria .
when i buy _num_ or more .
worst .
i 'm cooking and will refuse it when it gets here .
i was threatened by the delivery driver after he messed up my delivery address .
lousy customer service .
she supposedly even called .
no pizza .
no phone call .
worst customer service ever .
this is unacceptable !
( they never let me finish it ) .
going over to another agency ... sigh .
i drove an hour total through this whole process .
what a horrible system .
i wo n't stop .
horrible .
dont waste your time !
i refused .
highly ignorant people .
she was answering phones and scheduling appointments while working on my nails .
a monkey could have done a better job !
$ _num_ for a gel fill ?
i could have easily trimmed and painted my toes at home .
also all the techs continuously talked to each other and rarely to their clients .
not customer friendly at all .
why make an appointment if you ca n't keep it .
avoid at all cost !
i will not be coming back .
i can not tell you how upset i was .
she needs to go back to beauty school .
it is honestly not hard to match a picture .
so disappointed .
my daughter & i went in for a pedicure .
worst experience .
not even _num_ min !
not my favorite strip club by a long shot .
her : ca n't .
her : fuck you , you pig .
service was bad .
the waitress walks off and i take a sip of my drink .
they constantly give you that `` i wan na fight '' look .
after getting over that the waitress brought over menu and chips and salsa .
nothing too special about this place .
i was severely disappointed .
the service was horrible .
granted , the restaurant was full .
visited on march _num_ for dinner with a large group .
the chips and salsa were eh , ok .
visited juan 's after reading the numerous complementary reviews .
this is terrible .
the flavor was very blah .
really , really bad .
i do n't get it .
the bill was $ _num_ !
completely ridiculous .
never going back .
pizza cookie is ok .
people would tell me i just `` have to try oreganos '' .
no thanks .
i find it much too salty and not really worth the long wait .
not bad , but ok.
do n't bother .
this review is not for the food.
are you freakin kidding me ?
it was almost laughable .
was that really chicken lunch meat sliced thick in my pasta ?
for lunch , really ?
for starters we ordered the bistro calamari & boom dip .
total ( not including tip ) was about $ _num_ .
really not cool .
really bad for business .
however recently something seems a miss .
noodles were doughy and chewy and clearly different sized than the old method .
the chicken was in huge chunks vs the old shredded style .
staff is also so young and distracted with one another at camelback location .
the food is not prepared as well as the other locations .
the hot wings were not good .
the person next to me had the thin crust which looked pretty good .
on top of it all it was a little pricy for pizza .
i would not recommend this place .
this is no exaggeration .
no exceptions .
awful experience this week .
i was so disappointed !
very disappointing !
was n't a fan at all !
i was craving alfredo .
never asked for anything free , and i paid for my entire meal .
do n't eat here .
the worst experience ever .
our _num_ minute wait was close to an hour .
avoid this location .
longest hour of my life so far !
entree salad was fair .
shrimp diablo was too hot .
disappointing .
dip was good , artichokes were a little tough .
to be fair i tried oregano 's twice in _num_ different locations .
i have tried lots of pizza in arizona from many different restaurants .
we were so hungry and craving pasta from oregano 's .
she the accidentally gave our wings to the customer in front of us .
no thank you .
overall this place was just a let down .
just a do n't try to pick up food for take out .
man , do i pity dana 's employees .
pathetic .
they have ignored it .
do n't mind me just getting excited over ranch .
gross !
true value usually has lower prices too .
do not get keys made here !
management is horrible .
the dishwasher sucks big time !
ok , now lets get to the things that are not so great .
the place is still very loud around the apartments .
the windows are like paper and leak air like crazy .
i come in to eat something real quick side i was still working .
_num_ cheeseburgers a fry and a drink .
i was there approximately noon .
no response ever .
communication is horrible .
emails and messages are rarely returned .
i have to constantly fight and argue with those people .
this struck all of us as a bit of an excessive wait .
for just a simple pizza sub it was roughly $ _num_ .
have been dying to try this kosher place for some time .
went tonight and ordered a large _num_ cheese pizza .
o m g american cheese ?
are you kidding me ?
the italian was to die for .
service was slow and rude .
so , i trusted him and did that .
i ordered the clams in broth .
that tall white thing we saw was a vanilla cake , not the cheesecake .
slow service .
so overall ... weird experience ... will it keep me away ?
i opted for the shrimp udon soup .
i did get an added bonus of deep fat smell covering my clothing .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i have not been back .
you get _num_ stars one for decor and one because my sister likes it .
this particular night , i opted for the miso marinated sea bass .
not in that order , but you get my drift .
if anybody 's thinking of checking this place out , get takeout .
it 's generally crowded with rushed service and the food has yet to impress .
after sitting down our drink order was promptly taken and filled .
it was not .
the sushi was c grade .
passable but not anything i would return for .
the miso soup had iceberg lettuce in it .
first , bad service .
order was slow .
sushi quality was bad .
yakisoba noodle was burned .
husband had chicken parm .
i 've driven past a million times and kept thinking to try noodles .
wth was going on .
i ordered the chicken pad tai - thinking it would be a safe bet .
there were just _num_ of us and _num_ dishes between us .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the guy from the next table was complaining that he was drinking water !
i saw _num_ sushi rolls ordered by a couple that came in after myself .
not impressed at all .
this is a place that requires much better management and service .
horrible service .
will not come again .
i always substitute rice noodles , never had an issue .
this was our 3rd visit to cherry blossom .
avoid avoid avoid .
the salmon sashimi was not good .
i ca n't remember when i have ever left fried calamari on my plate .
this was my first time visiting cherry blossom noodle cafe .
i really wanted noodles , ie a noodle bar .
the waiter was short and was very impersonal .
he 'd refill our drinks and was on the ball .
lots of supermarket stuff , at a premium price .
it was very busy .
ridiculous .
so disappointing .
was craving sushi and decided to give this place a try .
ordered the sushi combo , added a miso soup and bowl of steamed rice .
its not the typical hole in the wall feel .
got the pad thai and added chicken .
rude .
rude .
rude .
at a table for one , i ordered a squid salad and three rolls .
ridiculous .
japanese and italian ?
i probably wont b back .
one would think that the owners would at least look at the reviews .
is there no manager !
avoid .
very rude service .
i have to sit in the back where i could smell the bathrooms .
i then immediately walked out !
very disappointed !
for a well seasoned asian food eater like myself , this place fails .
i 've had the smoked salmon ramen and the udon stir fry .
neither were very good .
the sushi is about par with the grocery stores .
a shame .
i decided to stop in for lunch since i now work in the area .
i 've been craving ramen and this seemed like a sure bet .
i left with utter disappointment .
extremely rude !
this is my first yelp review ever .
Negative
if you want nigiri sushi or sashimi , try hiro sushi .
we had dinner tonight and tried several dishes .
the rice was a little hard .
disappointing .
there was very little people inside the restaurant as we arrived around 2pm .
this strawberry cheesecake that was more like a mousse filling than cheesecake .
i felt like i was eating a spicy spaghetti soup .
maybe the food is fine but obvious problems with the service .
udon soup as did my co worker .
bad service and bad food .
no thanks .
parking sucks .
this place is pretty amazing !
could n't resist !
the lighting is dim for a restaurant and the sitting are has wooden tables .
soon as i walked in a was greeted and sat .
they have italian pastas and then they have their noodle options which were confusing .
i do n't like katsu .
the curry alone was not appetizing .
horrible service !
the food is awsome .
i strongly caution you to read their policies before buying anything .
they do n't .
my experience was not pleasant .
they are always soo helpful and they have way more stuff .
ca n't say the same for this place .
we called ahead to your store and inquired if you had one .
he could have cared less .
i wish your business luck for the future .
the price of the lens is $ _num_ retail .
no kidding .
everyone else at the club was friendly , helpful , and welcoming .
the staff was unapologetic and every single one of them gave us attitudes .
but this is ridiculous .
he drove away and had to come back for his money .
to the empty kitchen .
horrible .
totally disgusted .
out of beans , beef , and chicken .
i was having some brake trouble last week .
the buttons were off of it .
it ended up taking three hours as they waited for a part .
they do n't deserve it !
saved myself $ _num_ .
$ _num_ in tax ?
i suppose your $ _num_ brake special already includes the coupon .
total rip off !
it was not done .
later that night the manager blows up my phone to get paid of course .
i was certainly wrong .
you have been warned .
woke up early on my day off to make an 8am appointment .
11am i called for update .
`` it 's ok , if you ca n't afford a cadillac . ''
this is horrible business .
one thing is for sure , the owners will read about it .
service scam alert !
i did so for today , calling in the morning for a 1:30 appointment .
it 's been over _num_ hours ?
i go and let him know what 's my truck doing there ?
normally we 're down the street at camelback toyota .
ultimately , they want to keep my car over night .
i will not be going back !
no exaggeration on that !
the first repair was n't even the problem .
the next step would be a class action case .
they have referred to our issue as `` unexpected '' engine problems .
apparently this is a problem that many of this year and model have had .
terrible service for repairs .
it gets worse .
once he left we were unsure of what he actually said .
the salad had more then enough dressing , luckily the dressing was good .
on the way to a much nicer and hospitable establishment .
funky house salad with a creamy ranch ( ? )
white french baguette bread and butter was plentiful , thank god .
i could tell the dressing was house made as well as the croutons .
my husband had a pasta with italian sausage and chicken in a marinara sauce .
first time but never again !
disgusting food , terrible service .
things started poorly .
food is adequate but not authentic .
bread , butter , olive oil ?
here 's my problem .
not up to their par .
not appetizing !
even if your family has eaten here for _num_ years .
no explanation .
no apology .
not a pleasant experience after the drive .
when i inquired , debbie was curt to say the least .
i will not use them ever again .
both cupcakes were made from a mix .
this just set me off .
these little bakeries then wonder why they have to close their doors .
it 's been that way for sometime and is n't getting any better .
says it 's kosher , but apparently only sometimes .
they could not help me .
she just stared at me .
so , i purchased _num_ pastries and got out .
i walked in and looked at the cases .
puff pastry was flavorless .
that meant i was going to miss my little sister 's baby shower !
i have never cried so hard in my life !
eh ... .
i do not like saturdays here .
like , under _num_ young .
it 's just crap .
my gay neighbor took me here for afternoon cocktails on a sat .
gross !
not true and not cool .
no freaking way !
all in all , fuck that place .
this place is not a local dive bar .
like a damn toddler screaming for attention , that 's what she sounded like .
she just did n't deserve anything .
the missing _num_ stars .
Negative
slow .
i have not had a leak in over _num_ weeks since the replacement .
i repeat do not !
i can not stress enough about not sending your loved ones to this facility .
i first went to this dermatologist years ago and it was a so-so experience .
i will not be returning .
the wait time for my appointment was long .
the office sent over my rx to my local cvs .
and nothing .
she 's _num_ years old and this guy is man handling her .
office management needs to step in and fix asap !
i expected to have a paper gown in place for my exam .
and not that good .
but when i pick up my shirts they 're all folded up and boxed .
they just pressed them into the fabric more and sent me on my way .
needless to say , my hopes were let down .
the whole time , i was faced away from the mirror .
i am still left with cut marks _num_ days later .
_num_ ) appointments kept on time .
_num_ ) warm towel and massage .
all i can say is thank god my hair can grow back .
me almost two hundred for an oil change and adding coolant .
this is one cheap owner .
what a disappointment !
no more .
so , clearly the musician 's make the night .
the neighborhood is questionable .
the entrance is not obvious , the bar and the service are not inviting .
not worth it .
`` dude , i just said _num_ . ''
a _num_ , _num_ or _num_ series ? ''
+ previously mentioned worker was friendly .
rating _num_ stars only for the cabinet quality and resolution work .
not a word was mentioned about it from them , not a question !
they are so ignorant !
yeah i know sounds like most any used car sales operation in phoenix .
tell us the car price + tax , fees and registration .
that 's when we walked for the last time .
simply did n't trust them .
had an issue purchasing a vw back in _num_ .
my purchase experience was just o.k .
once you buy a car there , the customer service is over .
it 's ridiculous .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it amazed me how many times they would overlook things during maintenance .
but i would not recommend camelback .
my salesman was marty , who was very helpful .
barry , my salesperson , was wonderful .
went through all the standard bs that buying a new car comes with .
_num_ weeks sitting on the lot in less than clean condition ?
but ultimately i decided to buy , and get financing through vw credit .
i waited _num_ hours for nothing .
finally the paperwork arrived and all was resolved .
i drive over _num_ miles to see this car .
low miles , great price , and in amazing shape .
avoid .
they should move the waiting room away from the sales floor area .
unbelievable .
what a bunch of , well , use your favorite word .
the buying experience with any dealership , i found it to be as expected .
the local dealership never responded to my complaint .
my finance advisor had me come back and sign my contract four times !
think twice before servicing your car at camelback vw !
the grand total was $ _num_ !
worst ever .
Very negative
terrible .
terrible dealership !
terrible dealership !
terrible dealership !
ridiculous . )
big mistake .
it is a big dealership so looks very trusting .
they made up the 2nd time though .
_num_ months later i was stranded the battery died .
not holding my breath on this place .
you get the point - do n't wait , buy now at any cost !
not _num_ months .
i have purchased _num_ cars from camelback vw and had good experiences .
i informed him that i was the original owner of the auto .
he told me to contact camelback vw to figure this out .
do n't buy your car here .
get ready for more business vw north scottsdale .
i was a bmw customer for over _num_ years .
it drives like a _num_ series .
the service warranty offered by bmw however leaves vw in the dust !
strike _num_ !
strike _num_ !
so they are fixing that too , so hear i sit for _num_ hours !
strike _num_ !
it was torture .
they have a good selection , we just felt really unwelcome .
not cool .
not the kind of experience i expected of a place geared to all ages .
the staff need some serious training on customer service .
it was horrible .
i could 've had the same experience watching it on my ipad .
i walked in and there was nobody in the lobby and two gentlemen working .
bad idea .
i 've had better and it could be spicier .
i ordered a bean and cheese burrito for $ _num_ .
no frills .
we walked out paying nearly $ _num_ .
lisa contacted me directly to discuss our experience .
bringing our own case could have saved us a few hundred dollars !
stay away from this installer .
but i 'm glad i went for comparison shopping .
so , i made an appointment for last saturday to check it out .
they just need better staffing .
service = crap .
worst service ever .
horrible customer service .
would not recommended this place .
i 've used the shuttle service often to get to and from work .
german auto said i needed to replace my battery .
if i was the owner of this shop i would fire that employee immediately .
i work up the street and stop here one or twice a week .
be prepared to be upset it is gone has been for several years now .
bad .
very bad .
ordered a combo : sour cream enchilada , taco and tostada .
the restaurant is run down .
they were basically corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar cheese melted on top .
horrible .
the visit in november is likely my last .
the service was terrible .
you 've been warned .
avoid it !
too sad .
i 've been driving past this place for quite some time .
the service was typical of what you would typically expect from such a restaurant .
my wife and i both the green corn tamales w/ beans .
my _num_ cents !
i 'm not exactly sure .
i ordered a chicken burro enchilada style .
just do n't eat here .
my _num_ minute interaction was enough .
my tostada on the other hand was good .
other than that , it was an ok meal .
never rated a place this low before .
the menus came with dried up food on mine .
it tasted a little like flavored tomato paste as well .
went in at _num_ ; _num_ for an early dinner .
menu was hard to follow .
chips were good .
was sadly disappointed .
very uncomfortable .
it 's living hell .
i 'm sure it was probably my neighbor who was calling in the complaints .
i know exactly what i want to make i just need some assistance .
i 'm solely giving this place _num_ stars due to the selection of wigs .
i almost walked out .
it was definitely not hot enough .
not last night , not today and certainly not tomorrow .
i have been wanting to have americanized chinese for a week or so .
after driving up 7th st .
i was quickly greeted , though , and directed to my seat .
my drink order was taken before i even sat down , which was nice .
not exactly appetizing .
why _num_ stars , then ?
bad .
out of business on april _num_ , _num_ .
then tried charging us _num_ $ just to diagnose the issue .
they do n't deserve _num_ star !
i was not pleased .
which was very unprofessional .
inspect your purchase while you are still on site .
i get better service at home depot .
not impressed .
me : ok , can you substitute noodles for rice , please ?
it was just chicken , rice , egg , and green onions .
it was like hospital cafeteria veggies .
i would not recommend .
i called in my order , the meals were ready when i got there .
terrible lunch service .
ridiculous .
menu is reduced and new people are running the show .
it seems that most of my meal could easily be tossed aside .
i will not return here .
tokyo express was the place to go in phoenix for teriyaki chicken years ago .
do n't bother .
the car has not felt remotely right since it was in their hands .
they seem far more on top of things .
very disappointing .
no lox for me .
i 've given it about _num_ chances now .
i 'm sorry .
why yes , it was your friendly neighborhood roach !
too bad .
most likely will not be back .
used to come by once or twice a month for lunch .
the last time i was here was some time in _num_ .
the service was bad .
and then leaves .
the sandwich was dry .
i ordered `` french fries '' , but they were more like country potatoes .
severely disappointed .
the soup was also cold .
this was bitter and not smooth .
unpleasant .
disgusting .
not sliced from a loaf , but a patty that was baked .
my bill was $ _num_ .
with tip , $ _num_ .
i 'm _num_ .
ugh .
however ... .
left the waitress $ _num_ .
bread size is the same as an ordinary square loaf of sandwich bread .
gross !
skip this dump .
i 've been wanting to try scott 's for years .
there were chicken bones in my soup .
the pickles were the only bright spot of the meal .
six hours later my stomach is upset .
this morning , my wife , daughter and i walked there for brunch .
we sat out side , ordered and ate .
the food was average , and a bit overpriced .
living in the neighborhood , i 've been to scott 's maybe three times .
you would think that you get your sandwich wrapped in gold leaf .
the service is atrocious .
disappointing deli .
the breakfast was gross .
there sub should be priced at _num_ tops .
their pickle taste like its been marinated in salt .
ordered takeout for lunch at work .
really gross !
-- small , hard , and with an off taste .
deli sandwiches were ok.
the bagel was over toasted and tough .
it was obvious her english was limited .
wo n't go back .
bad , bad , bad .
terrible !
pizza was below average .
what a mistake .
hence the two star rating .
i give the place _num_ stars for an ok cheese pizza .
i 'm so disappointed .
$ _num_ per wing ?
i will not be returning here anytime soon .
it was hot in there .
i ordered fried zucchini sticks which were pretty good !
i will not be returning .
i had split a spinach salad with _num_ medium wings .
no effort !
pizza hell !
the wait was too long !
service was horrible .
the place was empty !
our hostess set us down in the main dining room .
the pizza was just basic pizza .
worst experience ordering pizza .
the chicken was more of a chicken patty or chicken nugget type of texture !
the frys and the wings were also noticeably from a bag .
all i asked for was actual cheese and not vegan cheese .
then he proceeds to bring out my actual sandwich with a side of fries .
i paid for my salad and my wine because that 's all i ate .
i visited this establishment for a take out pizza experience .
lack of quality .
sorry , not sorry .
but i was n't impressed .
horrible service .
she never apologized .
i do n't need to know how you feel about your staff .
um , its _num_ right ?
nothing done to make it right .
jalapeo peppers were average at best .
it was really just average food with not so great service .
)
needless to say we left as soon as we finished our drinks .
i was totally embarrassed .
i 'm not really a fan .
it was not .
unprofessional and lazy .
and i 'm calling to talk to ron or lee who own the place .
so i think there may have been a staffing problem the day i went .
without soul however , gumbo is just chicken soup .
her effort gave the place two stars instead of one .
what a mess !
they could even raise prices .
not a big fan of this place !
this place is terrible .
terrible laundry facilities .
this immediately stopped when i was given my keys .
but , it still feels hot in my apartment .
bad , bad , bad .
hubs and i stopped for breakfast .
but seriously , our waitress was training someone !
stone cold .
pancakes , laughable .
live up to the customer service standards expected of you !
hell no !
way to go denny 's ihop for me next time !
there 's usually a wait ( even at 2am ) the place is packed .
under normal circumstances i would walk out of a place like that .
denny 's is that go-to place for any and every occasion .
if you want a late night hangout this is awesome .
me and some friends walk in and get seated last saturday night .
the waiter finally comes over ... does n't say hello .
not too happy with the service last night .
nothing special .
beer is beer .
$ _num_ , the bartender tells me .
this place reeks of cheap .
we went for the beer specials , which were good .
it 's a very cheap place to have a drink .
it tastes like cheese substitute that comes from a bag .
guess cash does n't matter here .
kyle needs to go to customer service school .
some staff there think they are running studio _num_ .
walked in the other night and the place still smells like sewer .
ok.
because , frankly , i 've done that to myself already .
totally out of control .
all were simply horrific .
horrible .
no bueno .
hello , my name is thomas .
we exit the line , $ _num_ lighter , and find a seat .
wrong .
wrong .
wrong .
it was bad .
everything was bad .
first it is not a buffet .
this place makes taco bell seem gourmet !
are you kidding me ?
my stomach wishes i had n't .
the sopapillas were good , the icecream ?
i 'm not much of a fan for this place .
)
they did n't care .
i called to get my refill after saying i had made an appointment .
no call back .
here i am again without meds .
when i called to make an appointment , i was equally impressed .
firstly , this is a very small office .
they fixed something else instead and gave it back .
way to check your work , jerks .
this place is awful .
Negative
do n't be one of their sucker customers .
he said it would just be too much money .
very unprofessional .
Negative
he quoted $ _num_ .
i did it myself for under $ _num_ .
i purchased the vehicle and a warranty through desert schools .
really , i never heard anything from any loan officer !
not really .
the jean prices are a little higher here as well .
ten dollars for _num_ dresses , _num_ new tops , and _num_ new belt .
are you freaking kidding me ?
what a total scam .
i miss the glory days of buffalo .
gross !
i guess that 's what happens when you work in the industry .
not going here again .
however , i stopped in last week and experienced something totally different .
not so .
that happened _num_ times .
so , i drive over to pick up my pizza .
i walk in and i 'm greeted by a couple guys behind the counter .
this same technique was used on me before a chinese restaurant in west phoenix .
i like domino 's pizza when i just want to have cheap pizza delivered .
_num_ .
there are only so many crust options .
i probably wont order again .
in case you have not yet noticed , you have many competitors .
once again my local dominos lets me down .
this place is awful .
then laptop to place an order online .
also , it is byob for wine .
not soggy and warm .
this one was with salad .
he did finish .
very disappointing and irritating .
we split two entrees - filet mignon and lamb shank .
the entrees , however , were fair .
well , this is the 2nd time my fiance and i have been here .
i originally gave it a three star rating .
later , i called groupon and asked what they suggest .
i then ordered the lamb and my boyfriend ordered the pork .
just melted in your mouth i was super jealous .
it was awful .
the service was mediocre .
not worth a visit .
service : horrible .
never stepping in there again .
after valentine 's day here , i felt taken advantage of by the restaurant .
- brie brulee : a name far more interesting than the dish itself .
- salad : greens , fruit , nuts , and too much dressing .
- filet mignon : my boyfriend seemed to like it .
if so , you should look into a bistro , and pay bistro prices .
their attitude was terrible !
went for restaurant week .
i 've had better steak fries .
disappointed .
not impressed .
wrong .
wo n't be back .
i was ready to scream !
i 'm never going back .
no wine in sangria ?
ok i hated it !
seriously i would prefer to eat at taco bell than return here !
service is mediocre .
she was okay but obviously not to experienced .
i ordered the steak fajita $ _num_ .
i could not eat it .
she kindly offered to get me something else .
off the top of my head i said a chicken enchilada .
sure glad my uncle al could cook better than this .
that 's just gross !
mediocre at best .
not too tasty .
if anything , you should check these guys out for that .
too expensive for quality of food .
once i was greeted , the service was very impersonal .
chips and salsa came immediately .
i ordered my usual - shredded beef tacos .
days passed and nothing .
i went back in person again - was again promised a phone call .
days passed and nothing .
she just looked at me .
terrible service .
draft beer is luke warm .
weak .
bad , bad , bad .
a far cry from the south scottsdale location .
the wings i ordered were ice cold !
if you want good wings , try another location .
after _num_ wings the ranch was gone .
i ordered a dozen garlic parmesan wings and a order of fried zucchini .
i ordered boneless chicken wings .
otherwise , i highly do n't recommend .
came here for pizza and wings last night and the quality was way off .
decent for the money , but not spectacular .
this place is disgusting .
i merely ate here because of the good reviews .
it 's a dump in more ways then one .
the place is a pit and it always has been a pit .
i will never be back .
nothing to write home about .
lots of food , and cheap too !
not underwhelmed because my expectations were in the right place .
the service was horrible .
i think she 's very hard of hearing .
instead she opted to lie and then over charge me .
i believe that he can charge whatever he wants for his services .
i purchased glasses here almost _num_ months ago .
i 've been able to wear them for less than _num_ months .
_num_ months to get them ordered .
-- belly dancer goes after everyone in the room .
-- cuisine has come such a long way since _num_ get with it !
-- everything 's in _num_ except the prices .
so , i planned my boyfriend 's birthday dinner to be there last night .
either way , ive had much better gyro from other establishments .
i have had only issue after issue in the year i have been here .
my apt was _num_ degrees .
yea i 'm sure that 's the reason .
i am clean freak and would constantly be cleaning .
went in with a picture of exactly want i wanted .
this guy is not someone you want to to deal with .
avoid .
did n't like it .
nothing special .
i tried this tanning salon because each new customer gets a free tan .
she took me into the room and showed me how to use the bed .
they were so terrible .
but , they did fix it and we gave it another shot .
terrible .
lost my sweater .
do n't recommend .
go to american cleaners instead .
they destroyed _num_ of my husband 's shirts .
mens dress shirts are at least _num_ % higher than most other places .
terrible customer service here !
while i waited an associate approached me .
katie then approached me with the stores number .
i can not tolerate this service .
extremely rude .
bad customer service .
whatever you do do n't call this store .
staff is lazy and rude .
worst customer service ever .
it 's not always clean .
copy paper is copy paper after all .
and , then you wait .
and , you wait .
it cost me $ _num_ .
i would probably think twice about going back for the steak and cheese sandwich !
this place is located in a big strip mall where i used to work .
well , it sucked !
they come in _num_ sizes , a small and a _num_ inch .
and ugly !
then , i go to refill my drink .
fail .
do n't charge me for a fountain pop refill .
no no no .
yelp also let me down .
not good .
worst customer service .
i just closed my account at the tempe branch .
this store just is n't what it used to be .
seems like old navy caters more and more to kids and women .
low sodium tomato soup !
what the hell ?
i hate this place !
horrible with a capital horrible !
total crap .
this michaels is awful .
really , really terribly .
guess where i 'm going with the next picture ?
that much is obvious .
ridiculous !
consider yourself warned .
i wish that for the hassle of parking alone they would offer more .
almost ten years ago , my dad died .
i promised never to use them in the future at that moment .
do not rent an apartment here !
worst .
weird place .
totally ignored us .
the atmosphere of this place is loud .
it really is a giant portion , two , three servings really .
texas people know their chicken fried steak .
for dessert my girlfriend and i shared the peach cobbler .
i went here tonight after hearing good things about the place .
i was very disappointed .
it was just bland .
very disappointing .
for what it was , it was pricey .
let 's face it : chicken fried steak is a vehicle for gravy .
the sides that accompanied the meal let me down too .
to sum it up , people swear by this place .
my husband and i came to texaz for our one year anniversary .
not too strong but not too sweet .
the salad came quick - too quick .
i was craving a taste of home and saw reviews for this place .
sadly the food was terrible .
it is not authentic to not season this dish .
but this place gets _num_ stars for the service and experience .
just sorry ?
no compensation ?
was n't the best salad .
nope , nope , nope .
service was awesome , and the people were cool .
first time i visited , my boyfriend and i ordered the ribs meal .
the ribs were dry and extremely salty .
i ordered the t-bone , which was small and grey .
huge disappointment .
my friend got the shrimp dish done on the grill instead of fried .
the side salad that accompanied was fine too .
even the gravy tasted of flour and not much else .
the ribs were good though limited side options .
it is way , way way overrated .
is a pretty simple dish made from a cheap cut of meat .
the accompanying mashed potatoes were just okay .
we arrived 6pm friday night and had a short , _num_ minute wait .
they only take reservations for _num_ or more .
this place was horrible .
very disappointed .
ordered the chili on top of the chicken fried steak .
first the biscuit was just a little bigger than a silver dollar .
she just said ok and walked away .
there were _num_ of us .
we had _num_ in the party and the server was sharon .
it was terrible .
crappy !
at least not the good , trusted team .
forget special orders : those ca n't be accommodated any longer .
despite that being pointed out by several people , nothing changes .
must not want my service !
avoid this grooming salon .
for me , i needed to have the mint mint chocolate chocolate chip .
so , we get there and they are out of brownies .
i just did n't feel welcome .
hoping they 'd notice i would like to be helped .
i guess the service is only nice with select employees at that store .
ok , first time i was here was for lunch .
if i liked the burger , i 'd recommend only ordering it to go .
the darker and older the better .
small creatures called chickens .
the drinks here however are very cheap .
it 's quite sad .
her cheeseburger was over cooked and dry .
my wings were charred and dry .
it 's your typical dark , old and average dive bar .
i was totally displeased with this place .
this place is misleading .
do not recommend .
been coming here for years and probably will be coming here for years ahead .
the wings were chewy , which means they deep fried frozen wings .
the same lady who cooked my burger before , was working the grill .
( ew . )
just sad .
went here to try the highly recommended wine burger .
the place itself is very dark inside .
just do n't do it .
i went with some co-workers for lunch .
my chicken patty came out like a brick .
it hurt my teeth to bite into .
it was my first and my last visit to this establishment .
just do n't do it .
absolutely unbelievable .
horrible company .
i 'm a thrift store junkie and this particular goodwill location is just junkie .
yeah , tired .
i get that thrift stores sell used stuff .
i did n't buy anything .
wrong .
i 'm sorry .
my impression in that _num_ seconds was enough to send me packing .
gross .
place is dirty too .
horrible customer service .
excuse you ?
i 'm not the one who put you as a check in person .
such a weird experience .
probably should expect to spend your entire day here .
your front end people need training in good customer service .
this place is disgusting !
no raw salmon ?
am i at a bagel place or a sushi restaurant ?
slow service .
bland miso .
no raw salmon .
are you kidding me ?
no big deal .
star removal # _num_ .
star removal # _num_ .
star removal # _num_ .
p.s .
fail .
for my entree , i got the sesame chicken with brown rice .
pad thai sounded yummy and ordered chicken added to the dish .
the service was bad .
a sushi restaurant that does n't carry raw salmon ?
we arrived at moto and were seated promptly at a table by the bar .
they are neither .
yeah , i want to eat there ; where the women cry .
i 'm not kidding .
lame !
we just went for the first time tonight .
we will not be back .
service was incredibly slow .
some of the prices seem steep .
slightly loud , but you could still hear each other talk .
no huge loss here .
we probably wont go back .
it had more cucumber then tuna and forgot the cream cheese and avocado .
just an awful place .
completely flavorless .
owners need to consider taking this off the menu .
gross , gross gross ... .
b ) there was a _num_ % gratuity included in the bill .
not at moto .
drinks watered down .
we have been loyal customers of moto for years .
the waitress walked by _num_ or seven times and was avoiding making eye contact .
not impressed my last visit .
ordered lunch togo , i was craving the chicken salad .
service was good , which is why it gets _num_ stars .
they really need a second chef to help with the sushi .
she was told no .
in an empty restaurant .
there were _num_ tables including ours .
does n't say much about the owners or management .
sushi is okay but a little over priced .
the waiters pretty much ignore you once you are seated .
do n't like how the food tastes ?
i will never return and i will never recommend .
they burned my wings .
they are overcooked .
it was just gross .
how disappointing !
the food was n't that flavorful .
very disappointed .
tried spicy tuna , philly , chicken wings , chow mien .
horrible .
server was indifferent .
there was a bone in my salmon sashimi .
no plans to return .
pretty standard fare and definitely nothing too exotic .
our experience was offensive .
worst sushi in town .
bad service .
but the food did disappoint .
very , disappointed !
they were understaffed , but hey , it 's summer in az .
things slow down .
obvious she did not like dogs .
i responded with i know corporate , i was a partner for _num_ years .
a lot of stores are not gold standard .
not impressed at all .
terrible location .
could n't even drink it .
just a disgusting location .
effing gross .
gross gross gross .
i walked in around 10:30 am to a short line .
there was a small couch on clearance .
there was none left in that style that i liked .
i use the one on 7th st and mcdowell and never run into this .
he does not !
well hello thats not gel .
do n't get ryan .
i went to tiffany 's nails for a gel manicure .
poor customer service !
this particular time however , an older lady did my nails .
ugh .
i would consider the shopping experience here a small step up from walgreens .
i 'm always bummed out when i walk around .
nope , not ulta .
if it is , then they are doing stellar !
spend hundreds of dollars for a free hair brush ?
otherwise use the ulta in chandler for better parking .
too bad ulta !
but from the moment i walked it , i felt invisible .
during my wait there though , i happened to stumble upon the product .
i 'm some dude at ulta who does n't belong in ulta .
wrong .
it was gross .
staff ... ... ... not the best .
i ended up buying the eye brow paint we originally tried .
so staff sucks .
horrible job .
however they offered to `` fix '' it at a later date .
no thank you .
the cash wrap is always about _num_ people deep on weekends .
the woman that was following me could 've asked !
there was complete silence from her as she continue to ring my sale .
the associates are never around when i need to ask a question .
ok , no problem .
i have very thick hair and it is very hard to cut .
it is impossible to run in there quickly to pick something up .
downhill .
i am still searching for the ultimate italian beef sandwich .
is that what they called those pickled jalapenos they put on their sandwich ?
got _num_ italian roast beef sandwiches and fries .
chicago hamburger company was better .
philadelphia sandwich company was better , kinda .
twice if not 3x more meat .
very disappointed .
i 'll spend my _num_ bucks where i 'm appreciated .
she introduced me to italian beef and is a native of chicago .
not everyone 's big on small talk .
none offered .
i get my food , and leave .
people , i 'm from chicago .
thing is , it 'll be about $ _num_ .
better dogs at costco .
since moving to phoenix , we ca n't find a good one .
_num_ bucks for _num_ of them .
this guy is crazy for charging such a price .
i was very disappointed .
the beer battered zucchini rings were over salted .
no more .
very rude and uncaring .
the food is exact opposite of chicago food .
the overall experience has kept me from going back .
totally disappointed !
chicago style toppings were right but felt like a cold smoked sausage not polish .
kept wanting to drive back and let them know .
do n't have a grill ?
it worked too !
it seems like everything was marinated in oil then deep fried .
just awful .
fries are not so great .
i tried one , and eventually my friend let me have the last _num_ .
i think jack in the box could 've put out a better product overall .
poorly .
worst diner ever !
not just at this 16th street location but at all _num_ & diners .
it was a saturday night but wasnt too busy .
ordered the bacon cheeseburger , nothing fancy .
so half of the burger was cooked through and the other half was pink .
service was slow .
i was overwhelmed by the choices .
i went with lunch during breakfast time .
server rule # _num_ - never make your problem , their problem !
do i think that we deserved as much attention as anyone else there tonight ?
ick .
uh , rude .
not my first time here , definitely my last .
no discount , no nothing .
at best , hit and miss .
food - not so good .
i 've eaten here twice for breakfast .
carlos told me he tells his boss but nothing changes .
makes denny 's like like it deserves _num_ stars .
my _num_ year old son did like his kid 's meal .
damn shame .
the taste of the food was off .
it was gross .
so me and my husband came in last night , it was pretty busy .
it tasted like cardboard .
which is everything to me , other than what you are paying for .
had some high hopes for this one .
instead of onion rings they gave me fries .
the food was horrible !
two people coast _num_ .
the food was cheap in taste .
ca n't recommend .
the small amount of macaroni cheese old .
manager , move out from behind the counter and serve your customers .
ridiculous .
where 's my meatloaf !
last night , my husband and _num_ brothers came in at 11pm .
we sat for _num_ min , and left .
i 've shopped here before .
customer service was not that great .
tanks are way overpriced .
do n't let online pictures fool you !
if you have a pet , do n't live here .
this set me off .
i was so embarrassed .
my fries and onion rings are covered in salt .
slow .
Negative
never going back .
very disappointed .
badly .
this place is horrible !
this place is horrible !
good luck trying to get _num_ $ an hr for what you do .
thumbs down !
so i spent about $ _num_ that night .
so watch your bags !
are you kidding me ?
are you kidding me ?
too expensive .
no bread .
also cold .
my experience was horrible .
it has apparently not changed in that many years .
and my bill would not have been _num_ $ .
it was dry and not tasty .
nothing to really yelp about .
i was extremely disappointed .
it was pretty bad .
none of it was good .
service is totally crap .
my meal was awful .
he did however take a long time to bring the bill .
ultimately i would probably go back but i might try other places first .
will not be coming back here .
i will not be back .
extremely disappointed !
it 's not fancy .
it 's not particularly clean .
do not go to this place !
horrible job !
would not recommend to anyone .
terrible service !
it was horrible .
service is bad .
hit or miss here .
they refunded me for the manicure , at least .
techs are rude .
_num_ minutes !
nobody was waiting after me .
i will not be going back .
i went here a couple of times and was dissapointed every single time .
the obvious question is `` why then do you continue to go back ? ''
nasty stuff .
i wait .
the store seems to stay fairly busy in the morning hours .
either way , i 've made my final visit .
service has been only okay all three times we came here .
too much .
next time ill just come earlier .
i like your bagels !
einstein , what is it you make ?
really _num_ minutes ?
hello fellow yelpers !
i feel like i 'm on a middle school campus when i 'm there .
ordered a thin bagel toasted .
asked for potato salad for my side , received fruit .
literally yesterday i walked in .
this store needs to get to it together .
nothing complicated .
then why why did why did i why did i pay for that ?
ok i might be picky .
it is awful .
service is not good .
service here is awful .
just insisted that i had said delmonico .
we were extremely disappointed .
not this time .
sorry , lone star .
steak was not cooked properly .
.
horrible .
overpriced , mediocre food .
i meal prep so i make sure i have the correct portions .
the food tasted reheated ; that 's the only way to describe it .
my boyfriend stated that it was under par for him as well .
i cut a bite of steak off and tasted it .
she gave me a _num_ % discount on the steak only .
not good for vegetarians .
they actually tasted more like cereal than tortilla chips .
he ordered guacamole with his and i asked for sour creme with mine .
all in all -- nothing overwhelming , including the food .
not impressed at all .
no flavor !
we want spicy , cheesy goodness .
this place was just okay for me .
this really turned my stomach .
visited the gilbert restaurant tonight at 7pm .
me & boyfriend stopped in after work , sat in the bar .
its ok , i 'm mexican i can say this shit !
you want mexican , tons of other places .
gross .
very low budget !
we 're not dumb .
not impressed .
atmosphere is blah .
just nothing special .
hands down the most aweful margarita i have had in my life .
there are a ton of awesome restaurants in phoenix .
it was almost all salsa water , or whatever it is .
her only reply was that they have problems with people leaving without paying .
salsa was horrible .
very annoying .
terrible experience .
i ordered a shredded beef taco and my wife got the chicken con queso .
jar was the size a side of sour cream would come in .
rice was very bland .
chips and salsa were ok .
i ordered some of their hot sauce and it was chunky like their salsa .
the decor had a layer of dust all over it .
it felt very _num_ inside .
the beef enchilada had fatty pieces in it .
if all u want is cheap this is your place .
gross !
nothing special .
now the bank gets to duke it out with the restaurant .
it was offensive .
disappointing .
just not great food .
my chicken was overcooked .
i had a mandarin mule that was okay but not great .
all in all , not a great experience .
i am allergic to diet soda .
not here .
terrible service .
and what ever you do do n't let anthony touch your vehicle !
worst best buy ever .
big mistake .
i think i have it , i 'm ready to select .
they were just gone .
mgr yes , but you did show it to me .
i looked around with a customer service rep , who was in fact friendly .
i brought my laptop here to get repaired on thursday .
not a big fan of best buy .
today was sadly no different .
we now return to our regular scheduled program , customer service _num_ .
what a nightmare !
lo and behold they have _num_ in stock .
lame .
client service is awful .
purchased over _num_ laptop out of state .
do not buy geek squad insurance .
it 's $ _num_ .
this _num_ star goes to geek squad .
lame !
_num_ .
my phone was worthless .
_num_ .
selection sucks .
not sure why .
worst customer service ever .
i asked an employee for help ; he sent me to the geek squad .
_num_ , i think .
the second one they installed had a bubble underneath .
if it does n't , come back and they 'll install a third cover .
try not to come here .
just do n't do it .
they are less expensive and so much better !
man what a mess !
terrible customer service .
the bill was $ _num_ .
i would not use them again .
they are not my first choice .
it 's just disappointing .
would n't recommend .
very poor customer service .
Negative
recently purchased a car here .
i ask for jason , he still is n't in .
no sir .
how difficult could this to be to make .
i thought i was going to die without my caffeine fix .
sometimes these people forget what they do and who they work for .
the reason for the _num_ star rating ?
not my favorite starbucks location .
nowhere near a grande .
the price chart say that children under _num_ are $ _num_ .
do not recommend .
everyone i know that has ever mentioned the duck tells me they like it .
i do n't find that particularly appetizing .
wrong .
the sun dried tomatoes were huge , but overpowered everything else .
i thought duck would be great for a quick casual lunch .
avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians .
it was truly nasty .
there is no flow .
it was empty .
i pulled the full dispenser toward me so i could use it .
when i open my bag , there is only half a sandwich ?
not good .
ambiance a big zero .
i ordered a blt on sourdough bread with a side of coleslaw .
i opened my sandwich to find it made incorrectly , yet again .
i reached my breaking point and called asking to speak with a manager .
still not good .
sandwich just not good .
i tried the tuna on white rye .
not a fan .
it 's kind of hard to find since it 's located near office buildings .
after reading good reviews , we thought we 'd try this place out .
ugh .
it 's not worth it .
manager could n't help either .
would n't recommend this place .
i 'd really second guess this daycare .
i dropped off a prescription tuesday evening .
so slow .
one cashier and _num_ customers !
worst pharmacy service ever !
messed up my prescription several times this year already .
i need my medicine and nobody seems to care .
the store itself is alright .
excuse me ?
my doctor gave me this for a reason !
this is not okay !
now , though , there are new employees and unfair practices .
prepare to be disappointed .
very frustrating experience .
overall , annoying experience .
avoid if you can !
incredibly rude and inconsiderate .
i ended up in the ed with low blood pressure .
that 's not something we offer .
use it for animal medication , as long as it was available .
i called cvs to refill my own prescription .
so i say `` okay '' and wait while she checks .
the pharmacy gave me someone else 's prescription .
i 'll stick with the drive-thru from now on .
the tuna and salmon were pretty much just rice and the mashed fish filling .
we had attended the fish market last night , as a party of _num_ .
the atmosphere is like any other seafood restaurant with a mixed crowd .
i thought the taste was off , not my type of indian food .
no spice and no heat .
come on , it '' s a buffet and it 's lunch .
nobody has time to wait around for a piece of tandoori chicken .
time has not been kind to flavors of india .
obviously , i 'm going to order the rice .
they need to change the name of this place to nickel and dime .
but until then , i 'll probably just be staying away .
dirty and full of roaches .
the rice was dry and crunchy .
worst dish !
have went here for dinner before , it was okay but not great .
not spicy .
the dishes taste nothing like they should .
service was poor .
not my choice for a lunch companion !
i guess the thing to remember about this place is to get there early .
if you do n't , you will be waiting for food and _num_ .
i would recommend taking the food to-go or maybe going at lunch .
this place is a run down dump .
the buffet is over priced .
if u want it eat otherwise u can leave .
bad restaurant ... .
i asked around the office where i could find some great indian food !
the gentleman who greeted us was pleasant and i assume the owner .
if gas stations sold indian food , this is what it would taste like .
looks like we are only indian here .
ridiculous !
this was responsible for all of my pain !
this was responsible for all of my pain !
however , not the top notch service they provided at one time .
the staff might make it at the post office ... maybe .
worst customer service ever !
so disappointed !
to be fair i can not speak on any other dr in this establishment .
then he walked out .
and she repeated it .
not on one occasion ... three .
_num_ ) number one and three .
_num_ ) number two and three .
_num_ ) all of the above .
alright , i 'm done .
not very original .
dumb .
other than that , the place is ok for a dive bar .
oh well ... there are other jewelers in town .
customer service was horrific !
too expensive and had my computer for over a month for a simple repair !
horrible experience !
u could find much better places for computer repairs ... .
horrible customer service .
below is my outdated review .
i hate danny 's .
do n't bother .
the prices are on the high side and it can be quite busy .
but wait , there 's more .
i still feel it should get the same attention , especially at $ _num_ .
ok , the owner must be a complete idiot .
lucky me .
everytime i go to this place i wonder why .
they stole my change ( probably over _num_ bucks ) .
i was jammed up so she drove straight back .
i did n't buy it .
getting my car washed there is too much work for me .
danny 's was a _num_ star car wash _num_ years ago !
( average job on the wash then , btw . )
so _num_ hrs later , i call , find out it 's done .
worst car wash !
but no !
no thanks .
too bad .
they also try and do everything so fast that its confusing for some .
filled up the tank and chatted with the attendant , nice guy .
when they flagged me down , i walked around the truck .
had to get them to finish washing the spots off .
do n't go to this joint .
lol they try and upsell you everything they can think of .
you would think it would be a little better in a area like this .
i would recommend everyone go to hot shots on 16th street .
the management there has some integrity requirements when they hire employees .
time to find a new place to get my car washed .
i will finish this when i get my car back !
after drying it off , another guy got in to park it .
the vip carwash includes washing the car , correct ?
the passenger seat is wet .
especially for _num_ dollars .
i am extremely unhappy .
this place is horrible .
so , so horrible .
its been impossible to get in all week .
major suck .
i have been here _num_ times with three separate vehicles .
go somewhere where your car actually comes out clean though .
i feel if your paying _num_ for detail .
why so sloppy .
no thanks .
car was n't clean .
( do they really vacuum ?
_num_ bucks for a _num_ dollar air filter that is still mostly white ?
no thanks .
i will never be going back .
on a previous trip , they stole my husbands phone charger .
this is crazy that you have to inspect everything before you leave .
not helping your cause dude .
i finally get my car back , get inside and leave .
or maybe vacuuming out all of the stuff in the car is extra ?
Negative
negative experience overall .
i was so wrong .
i 'm highly disappointed .
next time i will go to los olivos .
i have taken my car to several places to get the oil changed .
no thanks .
no thanks .
no thanks !
plain and simple .
r u kidding me ?
lazy , unprofessional and downright rude .
it was like they actually used the stain water to clean the entire car .
why not focus on the interior and actually get it done right ?
utterly pathetic .
worst service ever !
i could n't believe it .
i have n't been to this location in a couple of years .
its awful !
not anymore .
she shrugged it off .
so crappy .
no thanks !
zero stars !
terrible .
terrible .
terrible .
never going back .
very frustrating .
i will not be going there ever again .
somebody is not telling me the truth .
the guy even gives me a student discount after i noticed they honor them .
i hate this place today .
most expensive car wash ever .
i filed a report with the police .
the last location before it was disabled was at danny 's car wash .
i 've never left there feeling like my car was clean .
Negative
not the most professional display , even for a car wash .
absolutely worst car wash !
people are very rude !
very poor service !
they probably could have used three .
never more than _num_ min wait .
bad move !
came in to get my newly painted car detailed .
told the guys it was newly painted to be careful .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i 'm not .
the wash was pretty decent and they got me in and out fairly quickly .
i have been a regular danny 's car wash customer for _num_ years .
not easily replaced !
i will not come here again .
ave car wash at best .
i see a chip in your window do you want it fixed .
nasty .
perhaps _num_ years from now this will be a hipster hot spot .
* two pool tables .
* cash only .
poor customer service .
ups needs to do review on this store and shut them down .
very poor customer service .
unbelievably bad experience .
sounded like it to me too originally .
stopped in to drop off an amazon return .
not here .
admittedly , like an idiot i just paid it .
as i started to leave , i felt taken advantage of .
i went back in to the store and asked for my boxes .
this is the exact opposite of customer service .
i 've been to other ups stores and never had any problems .
this was my first visit to this specific location .
it deserves no stars !
rude .
fed ex all the way from now on .
i called on a friday , and they were able to get me in .
the top part ( roots ) were alot lighter than the bottom .
avoid this service shop .
there are other repair stores in phoenix , use one of them .
it turned out that a tech had died and they were short handed .
they never once acknowledged me .
very very poor service .
but how much gas are we going to spend traveling back to you ?
worst service and pizza !
just ordered chicken bbq and i got something totally not chicken bbq .
these were tiny little shrimp drowned in sauce .
coworkers and i like to out out together after work .
ca n't comment on the food .
i had the wings , ( i 'm sure you are shocked ) .
a total cheers atmosphere for sure .
consider yourself warned .
typical late night bar food being served in a restaurant .
i used to love this place .
my boyfriend said taco bell had better tacos than here .
mediocre , at best .
i would go back for drinks but not likely the food .
rude staff at bar .
the beer was flat .
the food was decent for bar food and the beers were really cheap .
this place is n't good .
not a fan .
i want to like this place .
my girlfriend and i had been wanting to try it out a few times .
this is a huge pet peeve for me .
finally we went with the sesame crusted fish with a melon salsa .
we walked in to a very dark bar .
i actually have been there twice in the last two weeks .
to my surprise , some changes have been made .
i ordered the lamb and it was basically just fat .
it was horrible !
very disappointed .
worst experience ever !
but worst .
not so much .
i was expecting more since there are so many _num_ star reviews on yelp .
three friends and i tried rokerij for the first time on saturday .
he kept running away as we were trying to give him our dinner order .
worth the long wait to be seated .
i want to love this place so much .
i get that not everyone 's tastes are the same .
i will only return for drinks and to soak up the atmosphere .
ordered _num_ small plates .
calamari was cold .
overall , below average .
what a disappointment .
not impressed .
anyway then we ordered some grilled oysters .
such a shame .
ok no big deal .
no employees for _num_ minutes !
we walked out !
very disappointing .
downstairs was too small .
too dark .
too warm with the fireplace going .
bar was packed and the chairs and couch i tried were n't comfortable .
my duck was tough and fatty .
the waitress insisted that it had dressing .
downhill from there .
the hype is killing them .
the kitchen and especially the employees need attitude and training lessons .
nothing here was as shiny as the build up to the place .
she was excited that this would be something special .
but nothing came out that was exceptional except the creme brulee .
just a shame .
very disappointing .
the chicken schnitzel was fine .
slow service .
this is disgusting .
horrible customer service .
no big deal right ?
i was visiting phoenix and we came here for my brother 's birthday .
what a mistake .
it tastes like french toast , if you like that then go for it .
service was horrible .
when we arrived there was complimentary valet which was awesome .
that 's frustrating .
the kitchen and management really fell through on this tonight .
we will not be going back .
the downstairs bar and dining area with the fireplace has been a winter favorite .
i could pick it up and the red chile was paste !
no big deal right ?
just being a fresh order ?
not particularly fond of .
mask one 's odor .
as to the preparation of the actual meat .
lol so we said screw it and decided to check it out anyway .
he sucked !
the philly pizza was sub par .
_num_ minutes .
this occurred on good friday between 1:30 and 2:30 pm .
it was then that he told me he 'd check on our food .
my eggplant lasagna was certainly not the best i 've had .
although the place was full , i counted seven employees , including a manager .
i just had to try something different than dominos .
my only complain in general would be the cost for my pie .
overpriced , terrible service !
$ _num_ before tip is pretty steep for a med pizza .
italian sausage , black olives , onions , garlic and basil .
i first experienced nypd at another location , and fell completely in love .
something different was off with each experience .
i visited nypd this past saturday .
really disappointing .
you seriously disappointed me .
my husband and i stopped in on saturday around 1pm .
we split the chopped salad and had a few slices of pizza .
only way we got a drink refill was to flag down the waitress .
they gave us a _num_ % discount .
however , i am pregnant and just miss this place !
it was awful .
looks like streets of new york it is for now on .
disappointed in delivery .
terrible customer service .
not for the food .
( chicken on a salad ) .
so now my friend has some iceberg lettuce for lunch ?
not true new york pizza .
this is a chain of restaurants so that should say something .
the boneless wings we ordered were good at least .
wait , how did they even get seated ?
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
would not be coming here ever again .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
very , very average pizza .
really disappointed !
can i only conveniently use it at a verizon store ?
my friend and i walked in this store the other day .
terrible service !
i had brought the dog with me before .
horrible place !
so frustrating !
this guy just wanted me to sign off on whatever and be done .
had to reset whole phone to pull all my info in .
never never again .
disgusted .
halloween , xmas crap !
i 'm sorry .
they did have some outdoor patio furniture , that seemed reasonably priced .
failure , failure , failure .
it is very difficult to find real carbonara in the valley .
most places just toss together white sauce and bacon and call it a night .
not the greatest deal .
this place seems to want to get rich off being featured on food network .
( its byob , $ _num_ corkage fee ) .
we could n't believe it .
on one hand , i 'm glad i did .
reading many of the previous reviews , i had caught that it was byob .
no more byob .
it 's gross .
not impressed .
disappointed .
hardly inspiring .
a real disappointment overall .
terrible bruschetta .
the only item i have had and really enjoyed was the meat ball sandwich .
the waiter also tried desperately to get us to purchase wine and sides .
i will not be going back .
was this restaurant featured on a show from the food network ?
prices are too high .
maybe gordon ramsey should visit and give giuseppe a much needed reality check !
first off , i think the show got to the owner 's head !
the shop is extremely small with maybe seating for about _num_ .
the chairs were cheap plastic chairs .
we have tried it 2x and just wont do it again .
not sure .
the prices were a little steep for lunch and being in a strip mall .
the sauce was a little dry tasting , which was a bummer .
i find these _num_ star reviews to be incredibly suspicious .
i went there with several friends ( party of _num_ , including children ) .
was so looking forward to it , sounded yummy .
$ _num_ , for seven raviolis .
no soup .
no salad .
!
this place has nothing going !
it sure ai n't money baby any more or on point .
bruschetta was served on garlic bread .
my italian home cooking is much better and i 'm a novice .
he says , can you not see how busy we are ?
r u kidding me ?
only thing good was desert .
the owner thinks he 's a _num_ star chef .
plastic water cups with these prices ?
restaurants pay thousands to shows like dd & d just to be featured .
the meatballs were okay and slightly above average size , but $ _num_ each ?
this was a return visit , so we knew about the limited seating .
avoid .
the wine list here is ridiculously expensive .
i did not want to pay more .
then the waiter took the bottle away .
Very negative
the dish i ordered was a mushroom `` stew '' over ravioli dough .
not good .
i will not be back .
i was pissed off .
went there tonight .
very , very disappointed .
i did n't eat mine .
very disappointing .
review is not for the food .
the staff said only seating outside for right now .
not rushing to go there again !
not impressed , will not go back .
man was i wrong !
it did n't taste that good .
the size is a little more , too .
very tough and dry .
even baked ziti was just fair .
very inconsistent .
i will not be returning .
it was disappointing .
Neutral
tonight we decided to go back and had high hopes .
the salad was fine but too much dressing .
with _num_ reviews and _num_ stars i had high hopes .
we were sorely disappointed .
the restaurant : dated decor , christmas lights everywhere ( in feb ) .
poor layout .
the salad was lettuce carrots and oil .
the verdict : any other italian restaurant is a better choice .
l ordered the gnocchi with alfredo sauce .
i will not go there again .
too bad .
looks like he managed to have the review that detailed it removed .
service was poor .
left before we could try food .
very disappointed .
i ordered the linguini with clams and my husband ordered spaghetti bolognese .
the pasta was more than al dente , but still good .
linguini in that condition at home even on a week night in a rush !
not worth it at all .
so why only _num_ stars ?
weak .
no thanks .
i ate lunch here today , as it 's in my office complex .
this place sucks .
the service is awful .
i hate the parking structure .
a hot mess .
then we split a medium pesto , tomato , and basil pizza .
fries sucked .
do n't even bother .
this place is a ghost town with less than bright servers .
they were barely warm !
$ _num_ house wines , and $ _num_ drafts .
it was disgusting .
gross .
this is for the filiberto 's at _num_ e. indian school .
i 've been through their drive-thru twice with a _num_ month period .
super disappointed .
bland , awful .
not impressed .
Neutral
the service was good .
filibertos are individually owned and operated .
huge disappointment .
do n't rent unit _num_ .
i paid two hundred dollars to have the place professionally cleaned .
not a very good place at all .
i ca n't wait to move .
service = horrible .
i would say it was on par with a super _num_ .
however , to call this a `` center '' is laughable .
$ _num_ white rain on a marble counter top is n't classy .
it once again smelled of cheap .
rooms are not nice .
it had tasteful , old school decor and helpful people at every turn .
but , then again i think there is a w nearby .
we were having breakfast and a server recognized my friend from past visits .
like the biltmore hotel , royal palms , or the phoenician .
the restaurants are boring .
i would only stay here again i i had business meetings close by .
this ritz is disgusting .
easter brunch - i was so looking forward to this .
desserts were lackluster .
need to improve their restaurant reservation process .
i had been going to another dentist for my cleanings .
i ordered bowl of clam chowder and the main lobster .
we ordered apps , salads , wine and entrees .
_num_ stars .
however , it took another _num_ mins .
, while the mac needed more cooking time .
they seriously need some customer service skills .
um , excuse me ?
do not use these people .
they are incompetent and useless .
the food was n't spectacular .
menu selection disappointing .
what a disappointment .
only the valet was worthwhile .
our client got a turkey sandwich .
nothing to rave about .
it taste like pure mayonnaise on my salad .
the room was average but smelled musty .
for being as expensive as they are you would expect a better quality .
ok i 'm greek so i 'm very picky about so called greek food .
please tell me the owners are not really greek .
both pork and chicken were dry .
the owner responded to this very quickly which is nice and shows he cares .
stop giving us greasy fries they suck buddy .
come steve better gyros for all is needed .
but better gyros are down the street at z 's greek .
not impressed .
finally , my coworker politely asked if we could see the book .
she 's not here . ''
not my issue .
blow it out .
never been here before .
girls ' night out .
less drinks , same price !
do n't let this place fool you .
checked my credit card charges for _num_ separate receipts few days later .
she does n't deserve it !
spoke with another manager , francisco .
fail .
we went back to bartender again because she kept our valet and garage tickets !
a bit disappointing .
not the elegant classic bar i was expecting .
the bartender was awesome .
just bad service lol .
not a fan .
recently , they 've been able to get a super discount on salt .
very poor planning .
twice , they turned it off without coming in .
terrible coffee .
what a waste .
my advice , walk across the street to starbucks .
located at the biltmore fashion park , parking is usually an issue .
the crew on hand is usually a little surly and sometimes a little scary .
sadly , no .
finding a seating area off the main path is a plus !
although , i have so many friends who love this place .
no substitutions .
that cpk allowed substitutions ?
yep , i might tell other people .
i have not had a chance to review until now .
we walked in and there we some other parties seated waiting .
i went up to the hostess and gave her my name .
then another mom and child walked in and were seated .
cali ca n't do pizza !
nasty !
after the bite , i notified the server that there was cilantro .
_num_ folks , so we got to try a couple of different items .
it 's not the answer to any current question .
the pizza is never better than so-so .
in fact , i think applebee 's does salad better .
there are tables jammed into every possible space .
terrible !
it was disappointing .
super disgusting .
there was nothing warm about it .
she is incredibly rude .
it was so long ago i was there i ca n't remember the service .
when we finished she thanked me and apologized once again .
i 'm really disappointed .
we had the bleu cheese chips , which were excellent .
personally , a little under is always better than a little over .
however , the green beans we ordered as a side were very good .
i could tell throughout our meal the server seemed a little rushed .
safe to assume he forgot we sat down at one of his tables .
another _num_ for our food .
like the steak was gold on the inside .
i am writing as the mother of the bride where we had _num_ guests .
our entrees were salmon and new york steak .
_num_ plus min .
later we met server at the bar for the bill .
looked at a _num_ bedroom apartment here a few weeks back .
an application fee that was something insane like $ _num_ .
avoid at all costs !
this is typical of the place .
horrible .
do n't go to this location .
she says she can not change out a _num_ dollar bill .
pretty lame right ?
before i dropped a chunk of mass i ventured into this store .
yeah , this is before i started eating clean .
anyway , i had some questions .
same thing .
no big deal right ?
nothing came up .
a full _num_ second stare .
Positive
Positive
`` yeah , but we ate at miracle mile . ''
i got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes .
foul , foul , foul .
the child menu is short and fare priced .
i 've given you plenty of chances , mile .
for $ _num_ bucks really , .
no thanks .
seriously awful .
it 's also not particularly cheap .
i do n't get it .
the ruben was awful .
the mac 'n ' cheese was good , and the sandwich was just okay .
way better food , and for $ _num_ you can get dessert too .
ok , no problem .
avoid at all costs .
the portions are big , that is correct .
the real cheesecake factory is in my kitchen , just so you know .
sorry , penny .
wo n't go back .
this visit was most definitely my last visit to the cheesecake factory .
attitude was lousy !
_num_ % on the tab , which i understand with large groups .
anything other than lunch is overpriced .
in the end it 's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food .
not so much .
not a huge deal , being cheesecake factory on a saturday night .
it was packed on a thursday night .
everything on the menu is sooo expensive .
so standing over me taking my order made my stomach turn .
im asian i eat rice almost everyday .
we understand it is busy and there is going to be a wait .
we always like to come out here to have our favorite appetizer and dessert .
next time i 'll just go down the road to chili 's .
this location , however , is my least favorite .
the food is alright , just typical chain restaurant food .
i usually get the louisiana chicken pasta which always has a lot of flavor .
my beef with this chain is their portion sizes .
nothing special .
i went here last night with a party of _num_ .
they do not take reservations .
we got _num_ complimentary orders of nachos for waiting so long .
service was horrible .
i can see why this restaurant has three start rating .
this was nice as we do n't usually wait , just a habit .
good spices and the chicken was tender but more pasta then chicken .
yuk !
we left disappointed .
one one occasion i ordered the chicken piccata .
wrong !
it was very hard to eat .
the bathroom was very messy .
paper towels were everywhere .
i still hate it and i am still furious .
busy is one thing , cold is another .
i 'm _num_ yrs .
and , the `` experience level '' really showed itself in the color dept .
it just was not good .
umm ... no thanks !
fancy spa this place definitely is not !
do n't answer the phone like everything is the same .
not cute .
silly me , i should of known better .
grand total $ _num_ .
i am too mad to even go back and have someone else fix it .
fyi .
both the health dept and corporate need to make a surprise visit .
there is only one guy speaks english enough to understand what you want .
i think he hate his job , and he was in rush .
this place is gross .
in my mind i want to so are you blind !
ridiculous .
i want my money back .
do not go to this salon !
the gel manicure was peeling off the next day too .
terrible costumer service .
called and asked if they had availability to do _num_ pedicures together .
like , inedible .
wrong !
this place is horrible .
pricey and bad service .
so not worth it .
do n't bother .
the food was substandard , i could have eaten better at a cafeteria .
ridiculous .
no detailed bill ?
how _num_ faced can you get .
very disappointing .
i stopped in here for lunch one day last week .
will not go there ever again !
my review has n't changed for the new place also .
the place itself has a very odd smell inside .
not my top _num_ smells to smell when you walk into the place .
the place has a stink of a sewer .
big disappointment !
_num_ stars .
but either way , i 'm gon na look around next time .
however , they absolutely destroyed a pair of pants i brought in one time .
i prefer a sprouts , safeway , or frys .
then , they stopped making it .
i dunno , but i have n't seen it in like _num_ weeks .
love tj 's as we have been loyal customers since _num_ in socal .
not wanting to stand there all night i decided to jump in her line .
samantha proceeds to order me to use the chip in my new card .
he did n't apologize .
he did n't go check .
holy crap ... really ?
within _num_ days they were coming up and cracking on the sides .
restaurant was empty .
why _num_ stars ?
so disappointing !
so disappointing !
dry aged steak ?
garbage .
went to capital grille for resturant week pre fix menu .
bad food and terrible service .
they were a pain in the butt to deal with .
the caesar salad dressing tasted mostly of mayo .
i feel a steak restaurant should know how to cook a steak .
the mashed potatoes were lumpy .
the steaks themselves could 've used a bit of salt and pepper .
mediocre at best .
creamed spinach mediocre .
they gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go .
veggies that are plain but buttery .
even at that , we had to track him down to get the bill .
very bad service overall .
mine was horrible .
really horrible .
horrible .
for a $ _num_ meal that was average at best .
we had dinner there tonight .
this came out on a plate with gigantic grilled shrimp on top .
i think i 've had better steak at outback steakhouse .
tough , get used to it .
we will not be back !
this place has slipped significantly in the past _num_ months .
cheaper , better tasting and larger portions .
there 's your bad .
too bad .
turns out she gave me one less quesadilla then we asked for .
what a huge disappointment .
pita was bland .
the food is better than the service which is n't saying much .
disappointing .
had the vegetarian appetizer ( $ _num_ ) .
i mean , that 's what greek is all about .
restaurants run out of things .
probably $ _num_ worth of chicken .
salad was decent , but just a greek salad .
should have sent them back but did n't .
if you go here , get a cheap sandwich or a salad .
not cool .
no ambiance .
staff is incompetent and rude .
she ate her rice & salad , which were good .
shame .
we will not be back .
i was very sadly disappointed .
everything was bland .
greek salad tasted like nothing .
beer selection limited .
mediocre food .
avoid .
not impressed .
very , very disappointing .
my wife and i are attending a conference at the arizona biltmore .
it was a disaster .
stayed at the biltmore and went here because of an american express dining certificate .
Negative
we do n't mind paying for a really nice meal .
next to it was cooked spinach about the size of a thumb nail .
one of our friends actually sent hers back .
it was pretty pitiful .
we live on the property but we have never dined at the hotel .
ca n't say i would go back here again , maybe for brunch .
but it had a drive-thru and thats all i cared about .
the chips were rubber and dripping with oil .
guess not .
i had two glasses of wine and my husband had two top shelf martinis .
unacceptable .
anyway , staff , what staff ?
they were all too busy going through what they were going to buy .
( the really short _num_ 's looking guy ) .
ive been to better consignment places .
however they are the only ones that would take some of my older clothes .
new location needs better ventilation .
at my age , i think i know what a sweater is !
i am not returning ever again .
unacceptable !
not good .
and it 's not been for a couple of years .
only _num_ beers on tap .
garbage .
no apology .
i went to this salon for a _num_ minute full custom facial .
not at all the case .
good luck .
hit or miss .
service can be slow .
this place screams style over substance .
service and long waits are to be expected here .
the sashimi and rolls i 've had here were so-so .
i just have n't found this place to measure up .
zen _num_ is terrible .
there are other places that serve better sushi .
gross !
zen _num_ was my sushi standout in phoenix , az until today .
conclusion , go to zen _num_ for the ambiance .
not the food or drinks .
it was the opposite of fresh .
too bad , really .
ugh .
also , the place is crowded .
worse service ever !
pathetic sushi , really .
totally disappointed .
so sad .
please go else where for your sushi and japanese needs .
so cheap !
everything else sucks !
)
it 's that bad .
lame .
again , lame .
horrible .
nope ... no big deal .
oh , but wait !
and frankly , i never want to put that stuff in my mouth again .
bad wifi .
i could not taste coffee .
just the attitude get going and get of here .
tried out this place a few times and have never felt welcome .
read a review from the newspaper so i tried it .
not impressed .
gross !
soup 's not the same .
but i 'd get it to go rather than eat it there .
tried this place for lunch since i drive past it near my new place .
low quality food .
first bite was disgusting .
wrong !
Positive
we had lunch today .
beef and broccoli was salty .
the meats did not seem fresh .
the moo goo gai pan was very salty .
when i got home , i was immediately sitting down in the bathroom .
)
i went with five friends and nobody was all that impressed .
bland , boring and old !
get new recipes and better cooks .
do n't miss spicy mary .
do n't miss it .
am missing something ?
wrong !
the fries were cold .
they need to season the crawfish with spices and not hot sauce .
it was not good at all .
stopped in for lunch today , it 's a saturday .
i went there for lunch with my boyfriend .
it was pretty disappointing .
i had the red beans and rice which came out warm ... not hot .
the service was horrible .
not good .
it was not worth the time or money .
we were greatly disappointed .
last but not least , the gravy .
my review is already biased from the start .
i do n't mind eating food with seasoning and some pepper .
had lunch with my _num_ year old on friday , april _num_ .
both were mediocre .
everything was mediocre .
would not recommend this place .
the food was mediocre .
it was just a thin soup .
not the correct texture or flavor .
regarding the shrimp you really have to salt them heavily .
these shrimp lacked seasoning .
both the health dept and corporate need to make a surprise visit .
someone took me to the upscale biltmore shopping center one in phoenix .
ugh .
it was more like salt shrimp .
not good .
not much joy in this club .
just awful .
no apologies .
no warranty .
yes , i told you it was a _num_ '' cover i needed .
but i was wrong .
so i am stuck .
i refuse to go back .
through living social and yelp , i found 25th street automotive .
this was not the case .
)
i will also be sharing my experience online on social media etc .
the boots were sold as new , on clearance .
big mistake .
i give the bartender who works at this hotel _num_ stars .
stayed _num_ nights for spring training .
staff are super friendly , free breakfast and evening cocktails and snacks were nice .
extremely dissappointed i must say !
checking in was a breeze .
then i found out it 's only free if you 're a member .
an old hotel stench .
bathroom was very slow .
other than that , i 've experienced better .
this hotel was built in the 80s and clearly has not been updated since .
every entrance to every room faces the interior courtyard .
seven day stay between christmas and new year .
dirty beyond belief .
birds in the atrium while food was being served .
a dog was led through the atrium during breakfast .
_num_ ) no ac .
limited electrical outlets .
overall : not so good .
was sent _num_ miles away .
replacement hotel was not good either .
do not trust this property .
visited this hotel for a conference and opted for the upgraded room .
its _num_ degrees outside !
it was bad .
that was n't mentioned anywhere .
i am pissed !
i swear , even the outdoor lighting has been removed !
but they were not prepared .
recommend ?
the food was horrible !
it was unbelievably bad .
that 's absurd .
we were so disappointed !
clearly there was available tables we could have otherwise dined at .
we were visiting from out of town and this was our first visit .
very , very poor .
first course consisted of shrimp cake or butternut risotto .
the fish over couscous was cooked well .
the espresso creme brulee was more creme than brulee .
i am unsure why .
the restaurant was not full .
the views , outside , were fantastic .
a top , and , it is high .
handicapped , it is really dangerous .
they have taken away several of the better offerings .
real disappointment .
very marginal food .
we will not be going back !
the starters were passable but nothing either of us would want again .
the highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese .
i ate here this morning for brunch with my husband .
the omelettes were made to order and so were the pancakes which were good .
however , the rest of the food not so good .
visited for az restaurant week .
flourless chocolate cake was dry .
plus $ _num_ fee for valet ?
far nicer restaurants in phoenix offer valet for free .
bar options were ample , wine was decent , and service was adequate .
service was horrific .
sometimes she would even poop and pee herself obviously completely terrified .
be weary of this groomer .
i 'd wondered why my pup was acting so odd and scared .
i have a _num_ yr old puppy who goes to daycare regularly .
lame .
worst experience ever .
a waste _num_ $ .
she finally just quit talking so i drove to the pickup window .
some people just ca n't decide what they want '' .
not a good first impression .
this location needs to get it 's sh*t together .
just go to a different location .
very unprofessional and rude .
Very negative
i could 've made my own chicken dinner at that point .
avoid this location .
said they could n't give us a receipt .
our food was cold .
such a terrible experience .
we all proceed to go back and the man says he can fix it .
total rip off .
avoid .
a terrible experience .
well , it just goes to show that yelp does n't always work .
i gave my dog ( really ?
wan na bet that 's the first thing they look at ?
no blood .
no thanks .
the friendly operator said someone will get back with me shortly .
bad all around .
and they refuse to fix it !
management is horrible .
staff is completely useless .
run run run away .
i really think the `` phoenix film festival '' should be in phoenix .
i flagged down another server and told her we needed our server .
not a very professional response .
we spent our _num_ at a different restaurant .
however , we just had one issue after another during our visit .
the food is just ok nothing special .
will not go back .
no soup for you !
horrible !
that is a direct quote .
avoid this place !
you can tell the staff is n't well trained .
big disappointment .
but the rating goes mainly for the staff .
everyone has been back to see the doctor but i am still here .
urgent care would be a better option if you need to see the dr .
is it so expensive to have more than one bowl of chips ?
fail .
frustrating .
not impressed .
veggies were fresh , some of the quantities pretty skimpy .
but recent experience not so great .
not your best , saks .
he treated me as though i was an inconvenience to him .
this is just an unreal experience so i have to share .
she says they have them , but not for sale .
she next says , would you like to see one ?
obviously missed my joke .
terrible sales associates .
recently i decided i need to splurge on myself and get a chanel bag .
_num_ customer and _num_ associates and they were all trying to pass on me .
out loud .
i 've shopped on and off at that store for years .
i would recommend shopping around for better customer service .
_num_ days later and i feel exactly the same .
are you kidding me ?
steak is probably better in the desert .
the bad part !
played my _num_ holes and got out !
they cant tell me anything til monday !
she also saw bubbles in the platinum along with the crooked channel setting .
we shared the caprese appetizer .
for lunch i had the pasta trio .
disgusting .
)
while the ambience is pleasant , lighting is too bright for a romantic evening .
Negative
negatives were the entrees .
groupon rip-off .
the cake at the bottom was soaking wet .
disgusting !
had a groupon so my daughter and i tried it out .
we were given _num_ dinner menus for _num_ people .
very disappointed .
and if you want a cleaner taste , try 5th & wine .
will not go back again .
i am in shock this place has been open since _num_ .
nasty !
completely outdated overpriced food .
not here .
for starters we ordered the pasta trio sampler and the oyster rockefeller .
i look forward to cracking my crme brulee , darn !
the steak that my brother in law had was very large and cooked properly .
i had the pasta trio .
_num_ seating .
order taken , maybe slightly rushed .
even though , the most expensive item on the menu .
then service fell apart .
i 'm so glad i ordered sausage and peppers from another vendor .
the flavors were very blah .
_num_ bucks a plate .
more like an american italian food .
the best part is the tacky 80s decor !
it 's not authentic italian .
it is terribly ugly !
this place is a little over priced for what you get .
horrible food .
super disappointed .
i 'd never go back .
a week later , i started hearing the noise again .
ive been having my car serviced here for _num_ years .
zero customer service !
Negative
Negative
_num_ years plus of routine service , oil changes etc .
i will stick to the dealership and discount where they appreciate your business .
but overall this is just like any other food city .
otherwise it would have been _num_ .
we were n't really greeted .
i was really disappointed .
nothing too fancy , but certainly well-maintained and clean .
this place is dated .
not impressed .
so i dropped off tow shirts a few days ago for dry cleaning .
those guys should be in the money laundry business imho .
a while back i dropped off two dresses to be dry cleaned .
now i 'm left with _num_ of _num_ shirts for a work event .
i wish i had looked at yelp prior .
i will not be returning .
was the cook .
almost nothing served at this restaurant is made in house .
it was mediocre .
not terribly impressed .
lame !
thankfully the meal was pretty cheap .
i ordered the hot turkey sandwich .
it was tolerable .
the service is appalling .
_num_ minutes passed .
_num_ minutes ago .
no one cared .
hire more servers !
maybe then people will want to come back .
gross .
gross .
gross .
there were just two servers on for the place .
the potatoes and toast were pretty standard issue stuff .
service is bad !
bad !
bad !
we just left the restaurant .
.
chicken fried steak was frozen great .
after going , i think perhaps we should find a new place .
it was just ok.
the bartender , brian , was very attentive .
mediocre food .
mediocre service .
i ordered a grilled cheese with tomato and split pea soup .
wo n't be back .
$ _num_ dollars !
for me and my husband to have pancakes , eggs , bacon and coffee .
you fooled me once linda .
shame on me .
the employees here need some serious training .
original is a faded yellow and they used a shiny bright yellow .
looks totally sloppy .
i ca n't stand sprint .
the insurance only covers a direct replacement .
so why _num_ stars ?
no problems at all .
employees are slow .
hey , sprint , you guys need to close this store .
yeah , no thanks .
are you kidding me ?
wow was i wrong .
wrong , again .
do not use this store .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
do n't use sprint !
the phone purchasing process and service was fine ( explaining the _num_ stars ) .
i seriously hate this store .
the prices are reasonable but the choices are slim .
we 're talking ham , turkey , italian , that 's about it .
nothing special whatsoever .
wow .
Neutral
Very negative
negative stars !
_num_ stars ?
i do n't recommend this business .
the inside has a slightly funky odor , like spoiled cheese and cheap wine .
also they can get you in quickly for your initial visit and follow-up visits .
i do n't regret going to him , but i ca n't recommend him .
i was sent to collections without even getting my last bill in the mail .
so a total of _num_ teeth .
ridiculous .
do i look like the guy from a million little pieces ?
_num_ 's this place was the best club around .
was not even offered lap dances .
i must say i was let down once i stopped in to visit .
haha the drinks were a little over priced as well .
was decent .
so it is very easy to get to .
anyways there are way better clubs to go to in phx .
ca n't quite figure that one out .
never had anything like this before .
it is dreadful .
we love chinese food , and the food is definitely delicious .
however , we have issues every time we place an order by phone .
i let that roll off my shoulder and accepted the delivery order .
fail , fail and fail .
have n't been to the restaurant in ten years .
the crab puffs were much better with plenty of cream cheese .
our food was worse !
poor service .
worst service ever .
let me first say , i like frank 's food .
i was hoping it was a one time thing .
this way , they might get something right .
we were having a few kids sleep over and everyone voted for pizza .
never complain about food before it comes out of the kitchen .
it just tasted funky .
truly awful .
i ordered a large pizza and some cherry chipotle bbq wings .
absolutely horrible service .
it was just `` eh '' .
the delivery was not good .
worst pizza place ever .
do n't use their service .
the worst .
i took half a day off from work to meet eddie this morning .
do not buy this groupon !
they showed up late and made me wait .
there van broke down in my driveway .
every number on the groupon was for technicians , though .
but on the very bottom shelf .
this manager was seriously trying to cover her butt .
she went to a computer and did stuff and even made a phone call .
get over it and get on with your life . ''
yet the same woman was there trying to convince me that it was fine .
i had to come back _num_ times but she came back _num_ times .
people smoked around the pool and spa despite kids playing .
they would smoke outside our room and our non smoking room would smell .
there was freshly cut fruit and condiments of all kinds .
_num_ ) $ _num_ / day parking fee .
_num_ ) very little counter top space at the bathroom sink .
rooms would not even get cool .
will not be staying there again .
cheap .
it is not your average embassy suites .
luckily i only had an one night stay that was paid by my company .
very much in need of a complete overhaul .
i booked a suite ( not jr suite ) .
i was not pleased .
not very nice .
this embassy suites is ok .
did n't like this place .
the neighborhood was iffy and i was scared to leave the hotel after dark .
the room was dated but clean .
wo n't be back .
this place is n't all that well kept .
for me it was a company meeting .
the heating did n't work .
no heat .
terrible .
the interior is outdated .
rooms are quite large if you 've stayed in a embassy suites before .
hot water lasted only a very sort while ( 10-15 min max ) .
only issue we had during our two day stay was the noise .
there 's a loud slam from the gate which is easily heard .
the cons - its nothing like you 'd expect an embassy suites to be .
gross .
old and run down .
i opened closet door and it smelled of sewer .
by default , only decent food is in bar restaurant .
there is nothing very nice about this properly .
found out ( after i got there ) that it was built in _num_ .
this place is horrible .
avoid at all costs !
terrible experience here .
i have stayed in another hilton property in az .
the shuttle drivers were nice though , so they have that going for them .
as though i 'm an inconvenience .
so i 'm given another room now on the second floor .
so i will sleep tonight hoping my car is there in the morning .
`` are you sure it 's not just normal wear and tear ?
then why say it ? ''
i 'm a customer that has decorated my whole home with pottery barn furniture .
blah blah blah .
yes , she did let me return them .
has any and every sales person not seen pretty woman ?
horrible customer service .
horrible experience here .
it 's small crowded and hard to navigate .
not everything has a price tag that is easy to spot .
the other thing that gets me is that they have _num_ locations .
this sucks .
this time was different , though .
i do n't get it .
be very careful !
i was responsible and i knew it .
it was less than _num_ hours later .
_num_ . )
_num_ ) called the store again .
_num_ ) several weeks have passed .
so instead of getting a professional installation i got some half as $ workmanship .
so i did the repair myself .
this is update to review submitted in _num_ .
very disappointing .
they have not returned my phone calls or emails .
i do not recommend working here .
when i picked up the order , it was a 1/4 sheet cake .
i 'm not a happy customer .
i am really sad .
it was sad .
it 's a shame .
on one occasion , they completely forgot about the order .
unbelievable .
customer service was terrible .
would not recommend .
when we had out celebration that afternoon , it became clear .
like novelty t-shirts and stripper gear .
they have very limited inventory .
i mean , this is a health issue .
horrible company .
you know , picture of a flower , your dog , etc .
very rude !
i am leaving them by the end of this year .
disgusting .
i mean , cheap , fast , mexican food and its close by .
kinda scary , actually , as one reviewer put it .
is everything frozen and reheated ?
i order a chicken burrito with fundido and verde sauce .
wrong answer , jesus .
word to the wise : get the attitude in check , jesus .
salsa is n't spicy anymore .
this place is very overrated .
so awful .
worst food ever .
i asked our waiter this last time for a dessert menu .
the manager barely helped .
i ca n't stress to you enough not to go to this car wash .
find a better car wash !
terrible customer service .
i would not recommend to anyone !
my girlfriend has been going to this car wash for _num_ years .
unbelievable .
charge me for it ?
this is my third and last attempt to use this car wash .
needless to say , i 'm taking him to court .
this was my first time visiting this car wash .
i have been to simple cleanings that have done a better job .
very bad experience here .
so disappointing .
never going back .
- we have been using this car wash for years and that ends today .
usually it is clean and done in a timely manner .
there were also water marks left on both side of my doors .
no stars for this place.
i usually just get a carwash .
they really pressured me to upgrade and add leather conditioner .
ripoff .
but no .
this place was a complete let down .
not worth my time or money .
horrible service .
okay , so as a company , i have never really minded gucci .
clearly , she went in the back and put a hole in it herself .
the purse was only a month old .
however , i followed the rules and let them send it into the factory .
i have been shopping gucci for years vegas , california , new york .
i walked in ready to buy .
they followed us around acting like we were going to steal .
horrible service .
it was a very romantic anniversary , let me tell you .
are you kidding me ?
that is not an entre !
i could have received better service at applebee 's if you ask me , .
took my wife to ruth chris 's steakhouse for our anniversary .
we ordered steak of course , with garlic potatoes and some veggies .
nothing special .
when we were finally seated , the waiter was snooty .
i was super hungry and expected something to be comped .
looking at the prices , i was expecting a more seasonal selection .
umm yeah had to pass on the _num_ dollar strip steak special .
mediocre and overpriced .
the roasted chicken was on the greasy side but well seasoned .
american food i can make better in my own home .
i expect more from professional chefs than chicken sandwiches and steaks .
her attitude was unacceptable .
i just left .
long and short of it .
service was awful .
i really liked the ambience of houston 's , busy , but not loud .
the hawaiian rib-eye was however tough .
this place must be under new management and wait staff .
a small quality step down from across the street .
disappointment named salad .
never have to worry .
salad = worst .
are we that pretentious hillstone ?
it does n't go anywhere .
whatever else i ordered , the veggies were a `` must . ''
the entrance is nearly impossible to find .
the hawaiian ribeye was thinner than most ribeye cuts and had a hawaiian sauce .
$ _num_ for a side salad .
i 'd been to hillstone twice , once for lunch and once for dinner .
i wish hillstone would get it .
first off it is hard to find the hostess desk .
the food was not that good .
it was just awful !
the spinach artichoke dip was extremely greasy .
try the capital grille right down the road .
i was probably shooting a little high .
not such a great place .
this has always been one of our go too restaurants .
we sure miss houston 's in the biltmore .
went to meet my mom for lunch last friday with my little guy .
she suddenly became very worried we were going to `` tell '' on her .
he quickly apologized and offered to buy us our drinks .
we will be back to city hall , not so sure about hillstone .
truly a shame .
c'mon hillstone ... step up !
everything i saw was priced like nothing i had seen before .
try another restaurant in the area .
they serve a caesar salad which is served as a whole leaf .
cold night in phoenix .
party of _num_ sit at the patio for drinks and relax before dinner .
it 's not a fire or safety risk .
... out of prime rib .
service slow .
very disappointed !
two drinks , and two sandwiches for lunch .
$ _num_ plus dollars .
my date , a glass of chardonnay .
me , the veggie burger with kale salad .
not impressed .
it 's season _num_ with attitude .
nothing new or original on the menu .
not impressed .
this review is solely based off of the pretentious atmosphere .
he sat down with us in the booth .
but if anything larger is available then that would be amazing .
i made a reservation for _num_ and we were n't sat until almost _num_ .
she loved hers as did i when i had it .
this store is too busy .
luckily before purchasing my mac i researched until i knew exactly what i wanted .
f me running .
i tell them i want to return this , i tell them why .
so i repeat why i am returning it .
so i wait and he returns with what i assume is the manager .
_num_ .
i hate all apple stores .
i think apple looks for these guys to work in their stores .
not so fast .
this apple store is smaller than any of the others i 've been to .
i went into this location today to have a problem with my iphone fixed .
the `` help '' i received at this apple store was laughable .
they were very helpful .
worst customer service !
but they do n't care !
it was 7:30 and the line was out the door .
they got me in and out quickly for my appointment at the genius bar .
could use some training in customer service .
personnel hygiene is non existent for the apple employees .
freaking ridiculous !
worst customer care ever !
so disappointing !
might be switching my products out in the near future .
if you make an appointment for a customer , be available for the appointment .
apple 's `` service '' is abysmal .
the customer service , however , i had a big issue with .
he was very unprofessional .
this is ridiculous .
horrible customer service .
poor customer service .
horrible !
just completely horrible service .
all they wanted was more freaking money
why i think that apple has phenomenal products that make my life easier .
i can only assume the request was done at the last minute .
unhappy .
this location is terrible .
you 've been warned !
pretty ridiculous .
i dropped off my truck to have a window motor and oil change done .
but it obviously did not work .
meaning we are paying for the services .
in fact , i 've had one for _num_ straight days .
_num_ minute wait ?
it 's been a long day anyway , and this is the final stop .
after all , the overhead lights hurt my eyes .
stupid pharmacy .
ugh .
worst customers service .
in general , the stores never have stock on hand that is on sale .
me and my boyfriend shop here all of the time .
slow service .
yes they honored my warranty on my car battery .
once i 'm bought a battery they told this one clerk to install it .
then i 'll asked him to check the fluids .
morning crew not helpful .
it is extremely over-priced for what you get out of it .
there are so many better restaurants in this area that are less expensive .
we were extremely disappointed .
wrong .
restaurant week _num_ .
pecan pie smothered in caramel sauce .
valet charges $ _num_ ... okay .
wait staff was just okay .
for the main course , i had the boar ( $ _num_ ) .
my wife had the three fish entree ( $ _num_ ) .
my bill was $ _num_ before tip .
does n't look good .
there were two dining areas and we were placed in the larger room .
we sampled the duck tamales .
we immediately ordered martinis to try and ease the mood .
overall , it is not on my return list .
really needs attention from its chef owner .
what a disappointment .
the salmon quesadilla was much better .
the chocolate tart was the best dessert on the prix fixe menu .
it appears mr. vincent takes the cheap way out !
very disappointing .
still no acknowledgement .
tacky .
how embarrassing , after telling everyone that this was one of my favorite restaurants .
we spent hundreds of dollars on dinner and wine .
i walked in to the main counter , and a waiter approached me .
i have never seen this at any restaurant before .
first off , i 've been here before .
this time could not have been more opposite .
often for different parties , so you can imagine the confusion .
i had the runner take it back and continued to wait for my plate .
it was busy , but i have been a server before .
it 's too bad .
service is okay and the ambiance is n't quaint when cleanliness is questionable .
the bacon was okay but definitely reheated .
are you kidding me ?
i stayed , waited for my food , coffee and left later .
i completely understand , as i had a very similar experience !
you would think they would want to make a good first impression .
but not the coffee lady !
unbelievable .
my coffee was weak .
searching for a new primary care physician is difficult .
i 'm going to have to assume its family or something .
the long waits where always enjoyable .
this place is awful .
the homeless guy on the corner would probably give you better care .
been going to this general physician for about _num_ 1/2 years .
assume you will need to plan an extra hour at least when going in .
prescription refills are slow .
last year they called me said it was my time for a yearly exam .
made me wonder the last time someone went through there with a little _num_ .
jesus christ , someone just get me to the ymca !
so many regulars , who said they signed up , were without spots .
total chaos .
i hate this place .
i feel like i 've entered an 80s gym !
i wish and hope there 's some upgrades planned for this location soon .
i have been going to this _num_ h location for two years .
downhill all together .
the only reasons i continue to come here is _num_ location and _num_ price .
worst gym .
staff sucks .
the ac never seems to be working .
i 'm considering driving to _num_ ave and bell .
my purse and phone were taken but not my car keys or smart water .
place is dated .
the place for the most part seemed clean but they could 've done better .
this place is a dump .
i used just one session .
very poorly maintained .
horrible customer service .
do not join !
if not i am going to planet fitness for 1/4 the price .
well , wait , might as well go there anyway .
cheap , but dirty .
kinda disgusting .
well it 's been over _num_ yrs now an nothing has been done .
literally , i 'm standing next to the guy about to crack up .
the staff is in not knowledgable , helpful , or responsive .
are they helpful ?
no customer service whatsoever .
again , another long wait .
horrible customer service !
it was a nightmare .
if you need a door , go through them , not home depot !
super busy , all of the time .
pathetic !
this place is awful .
ryan and scott are not helping this store at all .
terrible customer service .
huge thumbs down .
as of november _num_ , this place changed hands .
while everything i said before was true , not it is n't necessarily .
overall , i do recommend ice house tavern .
you dont even have to travel to california .
it 's hard to get too mad though .
despite the confusion , it 's about the cheapest sit down restaurant around .
not sure .
in fact , it fell quite short .
it almost made me lose my appetite to be perfectly honest .
by the way , did i mention prices are also higher at this location ?
prices are a couple dollars less at the glendale spot .
this restaurant is not wheelchair accessible .
restaurant itself feels like a converted fast-food joint .
i have an unhealthy obsession with dumplings .
the soy chicken could be tastier but the dish was pretty good , nonetheless .
the atmosphere is weird !
i really would love to give a better rating to a vegan restaurant .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i wonder why they are not closed yet .
this is simply unacceptable .
fail !
absolutely terrible and slow service .
they gave me back dollar bills as if i should tip them .
i work in a restaurant and i know when service is completely shitty .
and another _num_ min for mine !
anyway , that was our experience .
it was so confusing .
not a chance we will go back there .
very disappointed .
there is nothing listed in the paperwork that says you operate this way .
money is not an issue .
i did n't have a coupon .
i could n't see a thing .
Neutral
this place was gross .
if not , you will get a more epic review peter piper on thomas !
online ordering system sucks .
it is horrible & disgusting !
_num_ mistakes i wish i never had done .
big mistake .
several repair request were made throughout the year .
it was fixed but only for a few days .
still no a/c !
they explained it was company policy and would do it again .
the fried shrimp is too oily for my taste .
i got the curry chicken and the bf got the bbq beef .
i probably would n't go back .
i go to this location fairly regularly and have never had a problem .
i get my order to go , the crispy shrimp plate .
( gross !
i really like ono 's mac salad and the katsu sauce with the shrimp .
maybe you should check your order before you leave .
this is ono hawaiian bbb and is not anything like hawaiian food .
avoid .
not a big fan of rubber chicken and warm macaroni salad .
visit the much better hawaiian options in phoenix !
wear shoes because the floor is sticky .
not good .
stale tasting .
like its the same sauce , just with different meats and sometimes vegetables .
the employee always look over work and seem to not enjoy being there .
i 've have been a customer for a long time .
most of the meat is made with alot of vegetables .
worse customer service ever !
the white rice was old and dry .
asking me to pay cash ... whatever .
i 'm harsh ?
it was cold .
try filiberto 's instead .
some of them have daily specials running monday thru friday .
just nasty .
no sense of urgency .
i had a visit in early _num_ and reported difficulty breathing .
it 's slimy and tastes like ham flavoring .
for a sandwich that costs this much , they need to use better product .
so i gave them another chance .
i also ordered a steak and cheese sub toasted .
terrible .
i was visiting phoenix a few weeks ago and i visited this bookstore .
those books are n't on shelves !
a lot of stuff seemed damaged and the prices were n't all that great .
i was just in with my mother to buy thanksgiving dishes .
this gas station stole my fucking money .
granted it was only $ _num_ but it was the only cash i had .
the most expensive and least competent gas station i 've ever encountered .
complete waste of time .
which is too bad .
shame on you !
seriously only _num_ flavors ?
each time they 've been out of mint n chip .
i suggest cold stones or the gelato spot .
there is always a strange odor near the back of the building .
( i had it checked out at different place ) .
sears told me my engine could blow up at any moment .
they checked and told me my tires were fine and they refilled my tires .
i paid top dollar for what i thought would be superior workmanship and service .
brian would not return our calls .
no reply .
gross !
extremely disappointed .
he closed the box and handed it back to me .
i 'm on my way to baja loco .
i prefer mine lightly battered and these were pretty heavily breaded and fried .
i would be very very cautious of this company .
it is on 30th st and camelback .
too expensive for a haircut .
stopped by this branch this morning on my way to work .
they could not even offer that .
Negative
un , no .
_num_ attempts and nothing .
i dunno man .
are you kidding me ?
they just want to make as much $ $ as they possible can .
we selected western dental due to my husband 's tooth pain .
avoid at all cost !
western dental still sucks !
who am i kidding , i can take it or leave it .
this location is a royal pain .
that 's just asking for trouble .
not worth it .
chipotle claims they have gluten free food .
i eat chipotle at least _num_ days out of the week .
there was not .
the issue tonight was a matter of health .
also , do n't expect a lot of lettuce in your salad .
i used the online ordering method to order my food for my lunch .
this location is not as stellar as others .
spend your money elsewhere .
this location sucks .
like i get it , customer service is rough at times but chill out .
horrible .
example : `` pico and hot salsa . ''
then they just put pico on and look at you .
`` sour cream , cheese , and lettuce . ''
so appetizing for $ _num_ .
rice is almost always uncooked .
ugh .
my food has been cold _num_ % of the time .
this is unacceptable !
this location sucks .
online ordering is an absolute joke .
i love chipotle , but this location needs to hire a whole new staff .
all the chairs are upside down on the tables as though they 're closed .
and the cashier does n't say a word .
on more than one occasion they have been out of ingredients .
_num_ minutes for corn ?
are you kidding me ?
i went straight from the restaurant to the house .
_num_ minutes max .
_num_ % of the time the portions are less than a scoop .
so disappointed .
just disappointing .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
not friendly at all .
_num_ .
_num_ .
even the cashier , which surprised me .
rude staff , unclean place .
i hate yelp .
if you have a problem , talk to management .
but here 's the thing , i have .
when i got home , the lettuce on my bowl was all brown .
disgusting .
she was so rude .
horrible customer service !
this location is often crowded and overwhelming ( long lines , feeling rushed ) .
like many yelpers have said , the portions here are pretty skimpy .
not good .
bland .
however , it was more expensive than other shops in the area .
they got there money , what do they care !
no website .
you 're a pizza place , how could you be out of pizza ?
also , your a jerk .
employees too concerned with chatting behind the counter other than offering to help you .
shipping is expensive too .
horrible !
she said no one !
not a nice person at all !
horrible customer service .
unfortunately , no .
not good .
sorry but no .
alas , no .
in my opinion he used too much polish .
ugh .
stopped here because i was in the area .
never again will i go back there .
extremely disappointed .
my daughter went here hoping to get her nails done for our vacation .
would not come back .
very low quality service .
she was a little aggressive with my fingers and not gentle at all .
it was so rushed '' .
no thanks !
i am very upset at being treated in this manner .
like the other reviewer , i experienced constant delays .
to add to this , their billing is out of control .
though expensive , i was prepared for this .
this location is terrible .
so your rent changes every month ... it is never the same amount .
they landscaping sucks .
worst apartment complex ever .
i can hear literally every step my upstairs neighbors take .
it 's incredibly annoying .
worst leasing office !
are you kidding me ?
they gave us a list of how to prepare for treatment .
i ran home to get my dog , and brought him back .
i ran home to get my dog , and brought him back .
on a tuesday night at _num_ , the lounge area was packed .
i could n't believe it .
it turned out she was the only server for the whole lounge !
um , ok ?
the tenderloin burger was very plain .
rarely did the server return to our table to check on us .
not worth it .
so there is absolutely nothing here i would eat .
$ _num_ spending ) for a holiday dinner this past christmas .
$ _num_ for _num_ antipasto plates ?
do n't bother .
( this part of the experience is very similar to buying time share ! )
but how much am i paying for this dish !
it 's only half a cut of the fish !
no apology , no nothing .
for entrees , i had the paella and dh had the duck .
it was fine , i guess .
we shared some chocolate dessert , which was good .
what a disappointment !
not the t cooks we use to know and love .
.
another thing i can not forgive is the lobster .
desserts were nothing worth writing about .
if i were alone , i 'd be probably waiting for service still .
outrageously disappointing .
we will not return here .
expect to leave hungry .
the portions are small and very expensive .
the mix it up bar is where i 'll be going next time .
out with the new , in with the old .
it 's been _num_ months .
the problem was with the food .
the service was terrible .
words can not describe just how wonderful the lamb and the steak were .
just a bland menu .
two types of fish , steaks , pork chop , saffron pasta .
it was dry .
had desert and a cup of coffee ... $ _num_ !
service was good , atmosphere was a little dark but ok .
the menu is pretentious .
wait we are in phoenix .
terrible terrible terrible !
Neutral
booked thanksgiving dinner for _num_ people a week in advance .
confirmed the reservation _num_ days in advance for a private room .
wrong .
gave away our room !
we could n't believe it .
fell far short of expectations .
guess we really were sol .
but they are so short staffed .
helped ourselves to our purchased water bottle put on service tray several tables away .
are n't salt bagels one of the standards ?
unbelievable .
his second choice is the chocolate chip coffee cake .
two weekends in a row is a trend .
very disappointed .
it makes me wonder how clean the kitchen area really was .
service is terrible .
_num_ stars for the food ; _num_ star for the service .
coming here is our weekend routine .
i was rushed and said `` plain ?
i get into my car and drive off .
plain cream cheese ?
however , do not lie to me .
if he 's lying to customers , what else is he lying about ?
not a good look my man .
my bagel is the easiest thing ever to remake .
terrible service .
horrible experience !
no apology for the whole mess !
horrible .
horrible .
i turned to the internet to find answers to my problems .
stores ok , always have to wait for service .
people wait for a long time to check out .
zero stars .
this place needs to be put out of business .
not overly impressed .
major disappointment !
just went through the drive-thru and ordered my usual .
nothing like eating a dry sandwich .
egg was overcooked .
totally unacceptable .
i got ta turkey sandwich or so i hope with a soda with ice .
it 's not some high fashion salon !
it 's a cheap hair cut place !
store is really unorganized .
i just left lol .
i went there about two years ago .
kudos to a senior still running a store .
no apologies .
would five _num_ stars if i could .
arrangement delivered looked very different from picture online .
the man working was so cold .
i find it hard to locate what i am looking for .
so i am over it .
for the most part , i am satisfied with this safeway .
shame on you bobby !
i do n't support places of business that treat their workers like $ hit .
shame on safeway .
and she was just cranky .
terrible customer service .
hire someone with a better attitude .
however , i 'm done with the arcadia store .
_num_ cashier open with _num_ carts lined up !
Neutral
bring the damn atm back !
the owners are total jerks ... you can kiss your security deposit goodbye !
the owners are total jerks ... you can kiss your security deposit goodbye !

_num_ .
_num_ .
his story would change constantly in between talking to my boyfriend and i separately .
it was the first such bill i had received !
well that does n't help me get back to work on time .
he 's not a honest person .
it takes management several weeks to a month to finish or begin repair requests .
walls are very thin .
this place is awful .
i ended up having to get my hands on some from someone else .
and would not eat .
this was not needed .
no fee - no visit .
i 've decided to return to my old vet .
completely unnecessary .
$ _num_ and a few free samples of treats .
this place is awful !
because i was loyal , i stayed .
the testing was going through the roof and kept getting higher and higher .
some concern ?
i declined the testing for that as it was expensive and unnecessary .
she gave me some supplies so i could force feed the cat .
horrible !
i have had far , far , far superior pedicures for $ _num_ .
do not get married here !
this was also disappointing .
this place is not living up to the hype .
and i 'm not talking like 2-3 ; it was more like _num_ .
terrible customer service .
so not a fun experience with the facial .
not okay !
very disappointed !
terrible service .
a _num_ star hotel should keep up all areas where guest view .
also , a little too sweet for my taste .
so take my review or leave it .
not me .
never , never , ever again .
as they should have done .
i 've been in this salon several times over the past couple of years .
and that is probably only a maybe !
this place is disgusting .
Positive
however , $ _num_ delivery charge ?
shame .
i know there are lots of different sandwiches here that you can try .
the bread is seriously the cheap kind you can get at the store .
what a disappointment .
someone in class suggested this place and it was such a let down .
unimpressed and disappointed .
there are so many other places to get better sandwiches .
will not be returning .
two thumbs down .
i have been going to sacks for _num_ years .
too sugary and strong spices .
not a lot of ambiance .
sure the massage was decent ( not in price mind you ) .
do n't let the comments on here fool you .
i was sadly disappointed .
not so much anymore .
this place is unbelievable .
boring !
basketball court is taken by adults .
very over priced for what you get in a family membership .
very disappointing .
i wish they would upgrade their cardio room .
why are there security cameras in the men 's locker room shower area ?
Neutral
bad business !
there was an emergency going on with another dog when i arrived .
she never called me back .
which is sad .
parking is a real problem .
and there seem be training issue going on at the coffee bar .
very disappointing .
ah , how i long for the good old days .
the prices here are n't exactly cheap .
it has a definite european touch .
for some reason now , the portions are smaller and not as good .
it 's a shame .
la grande orange grocery has a problem .
unnecessary .
that 's _num_ separate occasions , i have stopped going here at all !
this place has more hype than actual delivery !
parking is insane as it has been for several years .
the food quality is just so-so .
wish i had more passion for the place ... .
the kitchen was rocking it , though .
what a shame !
my heart burn on this visit begins at the register .
two two items together totaled $ _num_ .
ridiculous !
two other women chose lgo for a business lunch last week .
the grocery area is where you order lunch .
it was shoulder to shoulder with other patrons , most professionally dressed .
but it was sliced , lunch meat style turkey .
the manager contacted me the day i went to lgo .
sorry , no .
i do n't get it .
i finally visited this place for lunch with some co workers .
not much in the way of portion for the price you pay .
it 's ridiculous .
i hate tip jars .
the first time i was there it was very crowded .
i had a similar experience with snotty cashiers the 2nd time i went .
this place is all hype .
mediocre at best .
it was disgusting .
it 's been _num_ months .
the next problem i encountered was finding a place to eat my sandwich .
breakfast however is entirely different .
they ca n't cook eggs !
very disappointing .
i used to frequent this restaurant 2-3 times per week .
the passport ice tea is hit or miss .
i will be asking for a free drink next time i am in .
manager was rude .
the prices however are still way high .
there 's better ( and closer ) bakeries than this one .
completely disappointed .
not impressed at all .
terrible .
impossible to park .
no thanks .
the atmosphere is very overwhelming .
not french in any way !
atmosphere was chaotic .
my girlfriends and i decided to go out for dinner and drinks tonight .
shame on you !
cold coffee .
i even told the staff and they came back with more cold coffee .
kind of annoying .
excuse me ?
petco is probably my least favorite pet store to go to .
it smells like a pet store that is n't cleaned regularly .
will not be going again .
when she did see me , she began to ring me up .
of course , it 's target , so i still go back .
maybe i 'll get a t-shirt that reads `` i survived ghetto target '' .
yes , they do have sour patch flavored gum .
sure , in minimal amounts , but does that make it right ?
Very negative
the employees are rude .
my husband and i get starbucks , my son gets pizza , everyone wins .
look out or you will get run over .
the coke was flat .
Neutral
target has been a staple in our house for years .
that is not ok !
with my experience at target , it has been just okay .
there were plenty of tables and rest areas they could have sat in .
do n't ever use this service .
plus 1/2 the time you go in there it seems like nobody works there .
they had a _num_ pack of all _num_ colors .
i would n't come here again .
they charge too much according to her .
Negative
this place sucked .
i walk in and they get me in right away .
no , no no .
i do not want a flower .
Neutral
i 'm sorry .
they looked awful .
never again will i step foot in this shop .
i got the gel french manicure .
now i have a very noticeable white spot on my new french manicure .
it was such a rush job !
i 'm so livid , even writing this review .
just horrible !
continuing on ... so i had been wearing acrylic for about half a year .
wow how rude .
she ignored me .
$ _num_ is far more expensive than even the most skilled nail places .
just do n't go .
not worth your time or money !
no lotion ?
no massage ?
the lady very quickly put on one coat of the polish i chose .
the polish i had been wearing before is still on my nails in places .
i have only ever done yelp reviews for good things .
it is truly sad .
looking for a place closer to home based on reviews gave it a try .
plus it is so noisy that it is hard to be heard .
like not real hipsters .
once again this was 7pm on a sunday .
however , making reservations there is a different story .
they only take reservations for _num_ or more .
god for bid you ask them to split a check .
everybody raves about this place so i finally went with a friend last week .
service was awful .
wrong .
so sad .
the food an wine saved this from being a _num_ star in my book .
crap .
food is mediocre .
it simply needs some good floor management .
the wines are ok but somewhat pretentious .
nothing worth writing about except the bruschetta .
i just left literally _num_ seconds ago .
very disappointed .
why are restaurants now making their dining room a living room ?
not fond of high tops either .
stuffy atmosphere .
to much goat cheese and the bread ?
i will not be back .
felt like going home and changing my chuck taylor 's to dress shoes .
two people ordered bruschetta , french onion soup and different sandwiches .
the soup .
very inconsistent .
would not even check or anything .
will probably just stick to the tempe or central locations from now on .
but it did n't last .
unacceptable !
the veterinary assistants were very friendly .
the vets , however , can be really pushy .
so much that i would dread having to talk to them during every visit .
dr. rice was the only vet i liked .
no thanks , banfield .
by this time i had spent around five hundred dollars .
the staff aside from the actual vets are inept .
i made an appointment for him at banfield , just because it 's convenient .
i left feeling confident that my instructions would be followed .
)
the lines are ridiculous .
very frustrating .
this place is the dive bar of grocery stores .
sweat beads down my back .
more than once i have been approached in the parking lot for spare change .
i shop here , only cuz it 's close & cheap .
why did n't u call me ?
horrible customer service .
along the way i am `` greeted '' by kelly , the store manager .
nothing worth a crap .
i don '' t want _num_ cases of soda .
just a few months too old .
is the food bad ?
nevertheless , had to try the mojito .
so-so and have had better .
very wrong .
the rice is wet and salty .
too much cilantro all over the place .
this is not mexican is cuban .
yes we use cilantro on our food but not to that level .
rice should not be soup .
bad cooking period .
it sucked shit .
okay so last night _num_ of us came here for dinner .
couldnt get enough of it .
so disappointing .
our food was not good .
really disappointing .
this havana cafe location fell very short of our expectations .
we were greeted and shown to a table surrounded by plastic patio chairs .
they have definitely messed with the portions though .
and i 'm not talking about a few dollars too expensive .
the whole time , we wished we had the other waiter .
i invited my grandparents to meet me here for dinner back in march _num_ .
we started off with _num_ mojitos and some appetizers .
so i had another chicken dish .
big mistake .
also you need to wash your hands before serving food after counting money .
for the appetizer , i ordered the beef empanadas .
for the entrees , i ordered the fried chicken and the paradise pulled pork .
the rice was as plain as jane .
i 've had better tasting carnitas for half as much .
it was chicken with black beans and rice and a lime sauce .
but it does n't warrant my going back .
awful !
i obliged and let them know that water was just fine .
it was that bad .
i did n't get a refill .
third , the portions are small .
i will not be back .
it would take double the amount of food to satisfy me .
just save your money .
growing up in phoenix , i used to love havana cafe .
what a disappointment !
minutes to be seated .
stopped by here on saturday night .
we used to go here for $ _num_ breakfast every sat and sun morning .
so bad for business .
truly wish the previous owners would come back .
this place should be lucky anyone has walked in and kiss my feet .
service is terrible !
very bad customer service.
i 'm calling the manager of this restaurant to complain about this man .
i just got three rolled tacos with rice and beans for _num_ $ .
rang up to _num_ $ ?
it 's written like an advertisement .
the wings look nothing like they do in that picture .
ca n't wait to pass on this place for years to come !
ridiculous .
looks do n't beat good service .
and by alcoholic i mean `` owner '' specifically .
needless to say , even at the correct weight they are overpriced !
there were pipes and metal laying out by the front door .
not my kind of place .
worst place ever !
this is ridiculous .
unacceptable .
customer service sucked .
horrible !
terrible !
my _num_ year old and i were stunned !
i have also never been treated this way before .
was it outrageously priced ?
i ordered sizzling rice soup and some egg rolls .
worst food ever !
the food was n't very good .
i read the awesome reviews on this site , therefore my expectations were high .
this was not .
bland .
the kung pao chicken was the least amusing dish of all .
now , the cleanliness and presentation of the restaurant was in face phenomenal .
fail .
it was not worth the trip .
two bites , toss .
slim and none .
this is definitely the low end of chinese food for phoenix .
first , i ordered wor wonton soup .
then came my chicken chow mein .
more bean sprouts than chicken and , again , needed so much salt .
do n't eat here !
but nothing else would bring me back .
i used yelp to pick a restaurant to go to lunch with my mom .
the dish that we had was void of flavor .
not really .
just know it will be a very long wait .
my boyfriend went here for an allergy test .
find another doctor .
i am really dissatisfied with the place .
she saw my til _num_ .
my thought : then you better schedule like she takes a while .
it was time to stop by for a casual dinner .
our waiter was so-so .
our server was not very friendly .
gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup .
he has spent a lot of time being a chef and serving tables .
went a couple times too , just to be sure .
ridiculous .
the huevos rancheros sucked .
so we drove to ihop ... which was packed .
for like $ _num_ ?
$ _num_ for oj ?
there were several less than pleasant surprises .
my daughter 's eggs came out almost within seconds .
it was also not warm .
while waiting for our meal , i drank most of my coffee .
we will not go back .
ask me to hand it to you , do n't reach across !
i ordered a veggie burrito with a side of fruit and some salsa .
trust me , you can find a better breakfast or lunch place .
eggs benedict with spinach , bacon , tomato and avocado .
not cooked at all !
no bueno .
costco referred me to this place .
would you believe $ _num_ !
the owner was friendly , the service was prompt and fairly priced .
a big mistake .
this guy totally bait and switched me .
he refused .
they sent me to the frame doctor .
however , if they break again , he will repair them for free .
for $ _num_ i would have expected more .
maybe this shop is better at shoe repair than leather repair .
disappointed overall .
worst .
( wrong ! )
yep , that 's it .
some greasy chinese crispy noodles .
no soup .
the place is a rat hole !
one long tray of fried chicken ... .
only one thing missing .
how in the world does golden coin prepare that stuff ?
it 's awful .
i 'm dropping stars because it seems impossible to get a refill on soda .
kid 's under the age of four eat for $ _num_ .
it was surprisingly busy .
more veggie selections than meat , which can be good for some folks .
you never see a dermatologist ... only a pa .
unbelievable .
it was horrible .
however , i know that it was .
i use to cry myself to sleep every night .
they would n't tell me .
you can never get through to scheduling .
my acrylics tho was a totally different story .
terrible terrible job .
no just no !
she 's lucky she got a _num_ $ tip .
i will not be coming back !
all those girl are now gone and the people now just suck .
especially this dude they hired .
horrible service !
all around horrible .
also the salon was hot as shit .
i am new to the area and i wanted a dive bar night .
it is not as divey as the previous reviews in my opinion .
these qualities are opposite of a dive bar .
it seemed to me that the customers were all regulars .
not so much .
another pretentious take over .
horrible .
trashy bar .
came in with some coworkers to shoot pool at the end of the night .
but to get yelled at like that was crazy .
no exceptions ?
very rude .
not a good first impression .
not the dunkin donuts that everyone remembers .
not the best run dunkin ' donuts .
after hearing all the hype , the commercials on tv , etc ... .
so i went to this place a few times .
not just once , or twice , but three times .
mcdonalds has better coffee .
el pollo loco is overpriced food with very small proportions .
not worth it .
our enchiladas were stone cold .
fail .
got home _num_ chicken breast and drum stick .
chips were stale .
very disappointing .
they will forget ur utensils and ignore u when asked .
it 's _num_ ' inside .
i mean , really ?
it felt like a chicken fried steak .
we started our meals with salads .
she soon regretted her choice as much as i regretted my lasagna .
escargot - they tasted fine but they just seemed old-fashioned .
tried this restaurant this past friday for the first time .
it was just ok.
nothing special .
my husband hated his .
flavorless .
not the best and a little vinegary .
and i do n't need a coupon to eat there .
do n't use coupon !
skip this place .
ok quick tip food service industry .
they hired servers once and they have all been working there since .
those parts were there , just a very old school approach .
worst italian food ever .
rude waiter .
this place is way past its prime .
do n't expect your server to be pleasant at all .
i took some old navy shorts in for my _num_ year old son .
her price is $ _num_ !
this place is a complete joke .
my cousin called and talked to the receptionist asking for a quote .
$ _num_ it came out to !
she also told me that she gave my grandma a deal .
after the situation over the phone my grandma picked up the dress .
every time i 've been here , there is a problem .
they also have a nice punch card system .
they will tell you need a transmission flush .
complete and utter rip off !
i called discount tire and they fixed it for free .
this place is awful !
i 've been going to firestone for yrs all over arizona .
i 've been here a total of _num_ times this week !
made an account just so i could post this review .
lazy and unprofessional .
lazy lazy lazy .
shame on arcadia cleaners !
so , i could be in this for a few hundred dollars .
in all my life i have never had chili like the chicago hamburger co .
they have a turkey burger which sounds good .
the hot dog was better than the burger , but it was just average .
$ _num_ lunch for a burger , fries and a drink .
also the dining room is pretty much standing room only for lunch .
no thanks .
does n't look clean .
the walls are covered with anything and everything chicago , obviously .
chili - there was sugar in the recipe .
i did not like .
nothing like white castle .
i really doubt the meat is old due to the restaurant is quite busy .
i am sitting in the restaurant writing this review .
i 've passed this place several times and the parking lot is usually full .
i figure with _num_ starts on yelp , it might be worth a try .
fast forward to arizona .
for all the great toppings , that chicago style dog was a bust .
sad sad example of sliders .
staff was not friendly .
disgusting .
miss the old owners .
kids do n't count .
just lost my business .
last week i purchased _num_ `` raspberry fuzzy '' plants .
so much for trying to support local businesses .
Neutral
thai curry has the peanut sauce and curry base .
its like walking into a mexican restaurant and all the wait staff were chinese .
i came in for lunch and the menu was expansive !
i think it was thai bbq chicken with spicy sauce .
apparently its bbq so i settled for the sesame chicken .
bad idea .
this place is the equivalent of salt lick thai .
i have been here _num_ times .
i went to this place off of word of mouth for goo thai food .
they brought me a rice dish .
tonight was the night .
what a disaster !
maybe it is hard to get fresh basil in the desert ?
nothing special .
we made our order , beginning with chicken satay .
the vegetable curry was unlike any curry i 've ever seen .
certainly not the food and definitely not the service .
the second time i came with my husband , the service was deplorable .
i have tried this place _num_ times .
i ordered chicken pad thai and wanted to replace the shrimp with veggies .
i decided to go there and place my order .
Neutral
gross .
chicken satay was underwhelming .
if you order take out , expect even longer wait times .
there was no apology .
you wo n't be disappointed .
there just is n't .
it was a monday night , somewhat busy .
the server took another tables appetizers and drink order before asking me anything .
the rice was soggy .
everytime i try to go to this restaurant they are always closed .
the service was terrible .
my pad thai was delivered without the peanuts .
ordered eggplant and green curry with chicken .
i know people have their off days but this was waaaay off .
all in all , the ingredients and the noodles in the dish tasted cheap .
i only wish i did .
rude !
worst place ever !
food was gross !
extremely disappointing !
not worth it at all .
they were n't helpful at all .
they lied .
clearly , they want to get a bed sold , period .
dishonest ... pricing is horrible .
nothing is written as return policy .
never ever going back .
can not recommend .
Very negative
not really my job as the customer to go looking for a warm body .
rude staff !
then on the scheduled pick-up time , post event , they were also late .
i would not recommend this company .
i rented a rotisserie and grill here for a large party i was having .
we had several problems with equipment that we recently rented .
she did not get that .
i do n't expect perfection but my dogs deserve better than this .
it pains me to write this review .
but , i must yelp the truth .
( understand that i 've made all of that up in my head . )
but , no .
someone else had picked up my clothes .
but , i kept going back because i just love the owner .
but , i ca n't .
so disappointed .
Negative
i 'm so mad .
this kfc is horrible !
( i know , kinda weird ) .
this place is trash .
all the employees look like they are on drugs and not caring about anything .
pathetic .
bad idea !
)
my husband got the chili relleno and i got the cheese enchiladas .
surprisingly the server was very quick with the bill .
)
greasy , flavorless and unappealing .
i get to the restaurant for the first time this week .
i have never been treated like that before in my life .
boy was i wrong .
it was horrible !
oh and on that note , they only take cash also .
pain in the butt for someone who only carries a card .
you know my cheap self is n't paying an atm fee .
this year _num_ it 's $ _num_ .
about a yr or so ago , i stopped going to him .
i rarely go to the doctor and visiting this practice reminded me why .
if i were you , i would pass on this facility .
this is total bs .
monday is a holiday and i am in pain .
the phones are always busy if you wish to not talk at a machine .
once she left , i should have too .
chris responded `` we are big _num_ , what is customer service ?
she continued to challenge me and i was ready to walk out .
do n't go here !
the dentist was seriously the biggest idiot i have ever talked to .
i went in for the cheap breakfast for the first time at noon today .
anyhow the eggs and bacon came with that , they were cooked okay .
now the food is hit or miss and service is very spotty .
horrible experience .
i 'm really disappointed .
the food is bomb .
from the views , multiple tables waiting for their orders to be taken .
bad service .
never had this issue .
)
three , nothing .
it has to have _num_ inches of wear down on the sides !
will not shop there again !
then i scheduled a technician to come out and fix it .
worst customer service ever .
i had requested a saturday morning delivery online .
they lost another customer .
no customer service !
she ignored me .
flat out ignored .
so we wandered up there on our own .
s : oh , we work in rooms .
h : ok , so you ca n't help me then ?
and he walked away .
so - we walked out .
however , trying to flag down a salesman is another story .
i would suggest really giving the furniture a once over before they leave .
i called the phoenix showroom back , thinking that they could offer help .
on the morning of the delivery , i called for my window .
not earlier , not later .
not for me .
learn from my mistake .
fell in love with a set and bought it immediately .
very disappointing !
after you 've purchased , though , forget about it .
i was transferred again to have someone check on the item .
i spoke with pam and i explained the situation .
she also checked the stock number and confirmed that had _num_ in inventory .
one maintenance man to handle _num_ apartments i think is unreasonable !
safety is not their concern !
it 's nightmare management !
the food is not so good .
so bland .
so so bland .
big mistake .
the chicken was dry and chewy .
i go to pei wei for the spring rolls and the chicken lettuce wraps .
gross !
( sesame instead of honey seared . )
omg !
used to go here quite a bit but it 's been a few years .
stopped in for dinner about 8pm tonight .
on the way back from the bathroom i looked into the kitchen .
a complete disaster !
wrong !
unprofessional , sloppy , and rude .
i guess the customer service took away my hunger .
the rice is dry .
it 's too bad .
did not even feel me up !
not chinese food .
it 's called little shanghai .
i do not recommend this place .
i checked under the hood to see if anything was touched .
low and behold not a single thing had been touched .
$ _num_ for the small blizzard .
worst service !
ordered a hot fudge banana shake and instead got a sunday .
i ordered a cheeseburger and fries , and they microwaved a burger for me .
these guys are n't experts .
that was absolute bs .
they 're rude .
they 're pretentious .
worst bike shop ever !
not $ _num_ total !
never going back .
that seems to be typical of bike shops in phoenix .
i had been going to this shop for years , but i 'm done .
i have n't had any experiences with mary , whom everyone seems to love .
definitely a mixed review for me .
friendly but dishonest staff .
they simply are not trustworthy .
honestly i was frustrated .
it was $ _num_ .
i understand things are more expensive in stores but that seems a little steep .
big mistake .
no apology .
the crystal was still cracked .
i am completely speechless , grab the watch , and head for the door .
rip off !
no , just no !
drove a long way for nothing .
not a great way to gain new customers .
bad experience ... .
stopped by here recently with my mom to look for glasses for her .
disappointed again !
i used to order frequently but that will stop after these last visits .
( however , the delivery guy was great .
this is the closest pizza hut to where i live .
keep in mind , i live about _num_ mile away .
it was absolutely horrible .
of course it 's cold ... .
Negative
pasta was dry and crusty .
this place was just as it is reviewed .
when i went to pick it up , the place appeared dingy .
i am still haunted by this bathroom experience .
he says how about $ _num_ off and i agree .
not at this time .
do you want premium , high temp oil ?
no just regular oil .
no ... .
which did not feel genuine .
there is simply nothing jiffy about this place .
and i still had _num_ miles left u til next oil change .
the last half an hour , i was the only customer .
it 's a mess .
just ugh .
no thanks .
when i saw followed i mean through every aisle !
bottom line : do your self a favor and do n't stop by here .
disappointed in this decision .
_num_ hours sitting at a shop to fix the rim .
he quoted me a price $ _num_ higher than i paid a month ago !
i went in to get my tire change .
this is an all time low .
single .
so disappointing !
of course driving by the name caught my attention , so why not !
does n't make much sense .
maybe he just needs to stick with breasts !
do n't let him touch your face !
we ended up calling aaa and having it towed to their business .
posted on the window is $ _num_ oil change .
i will not be back .
in general , it was slightly above average for typical chinese food fair .
the other things thing sauteed string beans and shrimp with sizzling rice were alright .
ordered some thing simple , mongolian beef .
i ca n't find one redeeming quality about what i ate .
it was awful .
the ridiculous reply was .
that was really disappointing .
horrible food .
what a disappointing experience .
pushy and rude waitress .
everything else ordered hurt everyone 's stomach after they ate it .
noise all the time , and now i feel completely unsafe in my neighborhood .
so this is why people come and go here.
but alas , the owner .
would n't you want this too ?
but your job is to b.s .
just look at the lights and ask yourself why ?
that 's a complete lie .
said you 're an hour late ca n't help you .
said you 're an hour late ca n't help you .
if this happens again , may need to start looking for a new cleaner .
but i was on the road and craving a rice bowl .
ordered the house chicken togo .
bad food , bad service .
so i ate it .
it was beef , cabbage , and onion over rice .
there was a sauce used , but it might have just been soy sauce .
it was very bland .
which looked way better than what i ordered .
and the beef was like thinly sliced cheap roast beef .
i could have gotten a better tasting rice bowl at jack in the box .
the food is horrible .
chicken was old .
then leaves it like that .
so , again , we had to wait for her to come around .
this place is a train wreck in a refrigerator .
just awful .
this was just weird since the place is in large shopping center .
the repair is covered , and the guy should get paid .
so by this time , he was booked out for _num_ weeks .
this was june 25th .
i am so frustrated .
would not recommend .
it 's sad .
called 3x at 10:30 pm on a thursday and nobody picked up .
got into town late and so pizza delivery was our only choice .
way too expensive !
ridiculous .
not even that tasty .
i mean $ _num_ - _num_ for pasta ?
gross .
food was overpriced and restaurant not that nice .
not very impressed , food was just ok.
this place sucks .
very rude .
Positive
cold plates and food .
the worst ever !
a group of us were celebrating our daughters graduation from law school .
many classic dish are offered and many different cut of pasta .
the quality does n't justify the stiff prices .
maybe grabbing another drink and a little bite to eat before we go home .
mediocre at best .
no seasoning .
absent salt , pepper , and herbs of any kind .
this evening it was nothing like our previous experience .
very bland .
no flavor .
the only one i 've seen all night .
all in all , $ _num_ before gratuity for an average meal .
portions were very small for the prix fix $ _num_ .
we walked in with a large party for a special occasion .
i do n't care why it happened .
was the wine that expensive ?
did we order anything extraordinary ?
are we going back ?
-- just lettuce and tomato , nothing else .
the only really positive things i can say are _num_ .
nothing special .
it was very mediocre .
the food was not that great .
terrible service .
without waiting for a response or caring .
not even worth eating .
was there a rush at lunch for plates of gnocchi ?
all of our expectations from previous experiences fell far short of this last visit .
i can still feel the grease on the roof of my mouth .
on my second visit , it was the same story .
i tried an old cinnamon roll and an old bavarian cream with chocolate icing .
Neutral
that 's gross !
that i want to pay my bill .
Negative
the doctor sucked !
i was pissed !
dont come here , you have a better chance waiting for your doctor .
horrible experience !
not going there again .
very long wait .
i would highly suggest going to john c lincoln north mountain .
horrible experience !
the ct went well - and he was handled properly .
how can they deny it happened ?
is n't your job to cure people ?
it 's better than nothing .
the food was put in styrofoam boxes even though we planned on dining in .
hello , i 'm a huge panda lover .
hit or miss .
Negative
i 'm not expecting gourmet food here .
very disappointed .
it took me longer than if i 'd walked in .
i 'll be throwing the leftovers away .
eventually , my overpriced pizza was ready , and i drove home .
this thing looked terrible .
there were literally pools of grease .
it was ridiculous .
i 've had pizza from little caesars that blew that pizza away .
this review is for the sicilian pizza , with pepperoni , sausage and basil .
nice guys , but that does n't help the pizza taste any better .
i had to add a third slice just so i could eat there .
none not the sauce or the crust .
i doubt i would be back .
plus , the place smells like an old grease pit .
the sauce was average and , like the cheese , not plentiful enough .
unfortunately , it was awful .
the sauce was missing !
it just tasted like dough .
it was very vinegary .
i made my own large pepperoni and sausage pizza .
the pizza looks like toasted texas toast bread with some toppings on it .
the mozzarella sticks were cold .
the salad that comes with the pasta had more onions on it the lettuce .
the garlic bread was not good .
never gon na order from there again .
i will not go back .
are you kidding me ?
i have spent hundreds of dollars at this store .
my wife and i generally do n't carry cash on us .
according to him , impossible .
she promised to talk to eric and get back to me .
they say he fell and hit his head on the corner of a table .
makes me wonder if he actually fell or did something else happen .
i went in here to check out the facility .
highly do not recommend this place .
seems very poorly run .
it was worse than bad .
they look like garbage .
he was so rude .
ugh .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the calls always come through as adobe carpet cleaning .
do not use these people .
_num_ is the number they call from .
bad company .
Neutral
adobe has done furniture cleaning for me before .
no conditioner , nada .
never assume , just makes an ass out of u and me !
never use adobe carpet cleaning .
i do not recommend them !
_num_ day guarantee forget that !
far , far away .
stop calling my home .
this is one of those companies that you will wish you never dealt with .
anyways , i have an older car and the check engine light came on .
i had an _num_ am appointment for an oil change and head light problem .
the restaurant interior looked exactly as i had remembered .
first , she 's not a new waitress .
nasty !
as for the service it was average , not anything special .
Neutral
horrible experience .
the husband had a shredded beef enchilada & taco combo .
it is now made with cheap ingredients and tastes like oil .
now it seems like an overpriced fast food place .
but that 's really all i would recommend .
also , with the size , there is never a wait .
tacos were soaked in grease .
phoenix just doesnt know how to do mexican food ... .
they were very drunk , and the waiter continued to serve them .
atmosphere is very dated .
spicy wings are too spicy .
terrible .
i could have made dinner that night for way cheaper .
good food bad service .
this is not the place it used to be .
so disappointed .
portion was just smaller .
then to our favorite pollo fundido .
inside was dry .
so disappointing .
worst experience !
all was terrible !
not edible .
first of all , they were red ; not brown , but red .
the salsa in general needs more garlic and cilantro , in my opinion .
not a chance .
not good .
lets just say , it is hard to screw up mexican food .
the jalepeno cheese muffins were good .
just very confusing .
overall , confusing and strange .
ick !
nothing like a _num_ pound pizza full of oil & cheese .
went to kitchen to inspect pizza .
i was so excited to try it because people rave .
not a fan .
i could n't eat it .
he was unfortunately , terribly wrong .
not the pizza for me .
placed an order for delivery online for the first time tonight .
gross .
terrible !
are you kidding me ?
just so you know , they charge _num_ $ for tastings .
she even ventured to say `` this has happened before ! ''
why be arrogant .
i 'm so glad to be gone !
be sure to check my review in the non recommended section .
i would not recommend this community .
upon move out , they have so many hidden fees and charges .
we also referred a friend and were never given our $ _num_ referral bonus .
our experience quickly was spoiled by the apartment quality and management staff .
terrible !
after moving i still owed $ _num_ .
it was disgusting .
any dirt added to the old stains will bring them to the surface again .
not recommended at all .
not cool .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
because you just fell into the category of walmart .
so rude .
that was so creepy .
i 've been going to this store a lot beginning of the year .
owner is there almost always , ready to address and help with anything possible .
outrageous rip off .
the hours say that this store opens at 7:30 .
not good .
not impressed .
not really impressed .
the chips were light and crispy but the salsa tasted pretty generic .
not sure .
chicken enchiladas were so-so , a little heavy on the sauce .
service is tolerable , speed is tolerable , ambiance is tolerable .
they , however , are not the meal .
in other words , they were very flaky .
for my drink , i ordered a frozen mango margarita with salt .
the mango flavoring was faint and there was very little salt on the glass .
bad , just bad .
are you kidding me ?
big mistake .
so , i get it in a sense .
not a fan of that .
big mistake !
she was so rude .
cindy was the rudest server i have ever had .
now , i understand mexican food is not vegetarian friendly .
i am half mexican myself .
he informed me that there was lard in the tortilla .
maybe traditional in your family .
bacon was a luxury .
parking is weird .
the front entrance is not where the parking lot is .
the salsa and chips are overrated .
it tasted like charred asada .
unfortunately it never came .
nasty .
i only ordered drinks and had some chips and salsa .
drinks were good but the chips and salsa were n't great .
not impressed .
with that said , i really hope you come back . ''
direct quotes .
there are many better choices .
ate dinner here a week ago .
did not like the food .
not excited to try that again .
just very cheesy and greasy and i am sure a fat and calorie bomb !
-the cheese crisp was ok .
what the hell ?
_num_ .
_num_ who puts black olives in their salsa ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
my family went for lunch on a weekday .
there was some sort of work banquet going on in a back room .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i think it is long overdue for a cleaning .
_num_ .
no bueno !
so there went the idea of a burrito , a tostada .
depressing .
we walked out .
i 've eaten at this restaurant before when visiting phoenix .
so dissatisfied we went to denny 's afterwards .
sour cream and lime extra charge for your tacos ?
it was pretty forgettable .
no seasoning whatsoever .
disgusting !
the food was typical mexican food .
they were n't even that busy .
the only dish that appeared worth ordering was the street tacos .
they try hard , but it looks like the staff is on their own .
disappointed in the food .
for dessert , which were all polished off .
i was here a good _num_ years ago .
the old put the store bought chips on the bottom trick .
my son 's cheese quesadilla had tomatoes in it .
i called the waitress over and explained .
he was loud enough for everyone to hear in the room .
drinks not refilled !
i 'll never go back again .
just nothing to write home about .
that did not make it ok .
disappointed .
overall , not a good experience .
skip the queso .
vegetarians beware everything is made w/ meat .
ugh .
safe w/ grilled veggies .
another disappointment .
a terrible hh !
but the red chile burritos are beef and not pork .
reduced appetizers during the week , free buffet on fridays .
not good .
then only a partial delivery .
my carnitas tacos came out cold and dry .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the place sucks .
cheap food , cheap service .
horrible restaurant manager .
the bartender was a bitch too with attitude .
i had the beef fajitas and they were very tough .
the past few visits i 've noticed a decline in the service .
wo n't be returning .
the beer was cold though .
not impressed .
be sure to check your credit card statement .
i know , i live here .
never had pasta in a mexican restaurant .
beans taste like dirt .
my other prescriptions will remain at walgreens .
sent her home w/ _num_ prescriptions .
_num_ hours later they call .
will not use cvs again .
walgreens here we come , we 'll try anywhere else .
i would not recommend her .
all of the electrical went out shortly after .
very poor customer service !

this place is a money mill ... that is all .

not impressed .
( see photo ) i asked for grey and the color is more brown .
she literally covered my cuticles .
and did n't even look at me.
that is terrible !
the food tends to be very salty ( which americans tend to like ) .
so disappointing .
pei wei -- i miss the good times .
pei wei is a good not so fast version of fast food .
pei wei is also a bit overpriced for what it is .
i just never go with the expectation that i will get my correct order .
portions have been reduced and sandwiches have been added to the menu .
it is like pei wei with a few odd items and higher prices .
second , i walked in and two young girls were standing at the counter .
have been back since they switched back though .
today was really strange though .
grossed me out .
it was lunchtime and busy .
6:30 thursday pm .
no sushi .
no silverware .
no water cups .
service like mcdonald 's counter .
after ordering , i sat so that i was facing the kitchen .
it 's a low key place with some interesting folks .
drinks are cheap .
my boyfriend and i visited big daddy 's for lunch on a thursday .
would we return to big daddy 's ?
probably not .
the wife and i have n't been in since football season last year .

steak fries came and were uncooked .

my rule number two is dont make people wait on the check .
i was really looking forward to having dinner here .
the food was hit and miss .
_num_ star atmosphere .

waiter was extremely inattentive .
this is _num_ % inexcusable for a restaurant in this price range .
Negative
if you want to enjoy the view , simply stop by for drinks .
finally , the food was really salty !
this was extremely disappointing .
very disappointing .
unbelievable and extremely disappointing .
my husband had never tried them so we took a chance .
we also ordered the kobe beef sliders and the tomato salad .
friday night dinner service and out of bread ?
the waiter offered us comp deserts for the trouble , at least .
my girlfriend and i decided to book reservations for this restaurant .
would not go back .
the case had a yelp sticker on it .
i then tried the shrimp appetizer with quinoa .

we get there and there are about _num_ weddings going on .
service was slow and inattentive .
the guy knew i was gluten free because i had a few questions .
waiter brought by dessert menus .

she is not enjoying this one bit .
to start we were instantly greeted and the place looked clean .
horrible .
horrible .
horrible .
extra for taking off your old polish ! ''
i would never return , obviously .
last time she made me wait an hour and a half .
what a horrible experience !
i will never go back .
i ran to walgreens next door to get some cash .
i would suggest to try another nail salon !
this place was horrible .
what in the flying f ?
would not recommend .
so she agree to give me a `` $ _num_ discount '' .
i would advise and really investigate their prices before you sit down .
very rushed job .
they just want to get you in and out .
take your money elsewhere .
just this huge wall of products .
i could n't believe it .
it was gross .
there is nothing soothing about this salon .
after the reviews i read , i was expecting a really upscale salon .
i was very dissapointed .
when i spend that much money on a salon visit .
thanks for nothing .
avoid this place !
instead was a mess .
never had this happen before .
avoid this place .
my first mistake .
there was blood on the bath room door and walls of my patient bathroom .
my husband and i arrived there at 7:30 pm last evening .

my garage door opener died a few weeks ago .
then died again .
note : my home warranty company chose this company .
poor customer service .
no call .
that was _num_ days ago !
do not use this company !
the garage door , itself , worked just fine using the wall opener .
a major disappointment !
pretty blah , really .
the combos are $ _num_ and drinks are extra ( $ _num_ ) .
nothing special about the decoration .
kind of plain could of used some cleaning .
we get our drinks and wait and wait .
later our waitress came out and said our food was being made .
this is your typical mom and pop place .
not so with this one .
we walked in and were seated promptly .
the machaca burrito was made using ground beef with spices .
not your typical machaca .
i would not visit here again .
do not eat at this restaurant .
the green corn tamale with green sauce was awesome !
not this time .
it seems to cater more to the neighborhood regulars than anyone else .
horrible .
$ _num_ for a tiny burrito .
chips and salsa what mexican restaurant charges for that ?
no more .
at least they are cheap , and you get what you pay for .
i would not recommend at all !

we 'll see what happens : / i 'm not holding my breath .

my home warranty company assigned them to look into my a/c issues .
8:00 am friday morning and i have n't heard from anyone .
they gave me a window from _num_ am - _num_ pm .
my home warranty company sent them out .
the cherry on top of the sundae is their f rating from the bbb .
lazy , crooked and awful .
never again will i use this place .
needless to say , i 'm contacting another company .
really think twice before using this company .
do not use this location !
do n't go here .
after many more miles put in we called them dropped it off on monday .

i will never return here .
they have spa chairs for pedicures .
the polish is sloppy .

the sewer pipes in the park are old and are being replaced through out .
basically anything goes if you do n't like it your told to move .
the park is very pro smoking and pets .
also , the prices randomly change based on who is ringing you up .
but certainly never go out of your way to eat here .
how they have been in business this long is beyond me .
i also purchased a small jar of pesto recommended by the owner .
perhaps next time i should get a sub .

horrible !
i could have done better to wash them myself and iron everything .
the place is more like a junk store than a reputable shoe repair .

if you 're looking for average at best , this is it .
i had the rigatoni with smoked chicken in a parmesan cream sauce .
`` i dunno '' .
way over-priced !
and seven dollars for mac-n-cheese , that is outrageous !
another reviewer described the decor as being in their grandparents house .
first off , `` joey 's california bistro italian restaurant '' ?
a waiter was screaming at a customer from the other side of the restaurant .
oh , and the shrimp was boiled .
rather than coming here , just eat the money .
half the pizza was now sitting on the bar counter .
it was sub-par .
this place was terrible .

poor gal .
this salad was $ _num_ .
he got three stuffed shells in a meat sauce .
wood fired pizza ?
we ordered meat dumplings , orange chicken and garlic chicken .
the first time i visited , i ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce .
i dislike drinking from cups at restaurants .
then this is where it went south .
i 'm not joking .
so sad .
with that being said let 's start off on a positive note .
my dad and i had takeout from this place last night .
he got the kung pao chicken and i had the house chicken .
my hot and sour soup tasted quite different from the way it had .
egg rolls are greasy and over fried .
i have been coming here off and on for years .
teriyaki was nasty .
for the main course , we ordered some grilled veggie burritos enchilada style .

then i tried some nachos , with the `` carne asada '' on it .
i asked for diced tomatoes and got two half tomatoes with cuts in them .
it 's ok.

my expectations are low .
despite this , peter piper pizza found a way to disappoint .
god only knows what they could do to my food behind closed doors .
i am sorry .
you really let me down this past friday night .
me neither .
the menus were disgusting .
and it was $ _num_ !
the burgers are , like most places , served with french fries .
we want to get a pile of fries with our meal .
with beans and cheese on them ( sort of like mini cheese crisps ) .
food was up to par today .
worst dining experience ever .
absolute disaster .
the manager comp 'd the meal however that was it .
i would strongly advise not to eat here .
the chicken was rubber and had me question if was actually chicken .
no service .
no acknowledgement .
the service was slow .
the food had rushed air to it .

fast forward _num_ 1/2 years -- i desperately needed to use a restroom .
the first time i fell in love .

very annoyed .
he was not groomed .
and seriously , who runs out of plain bagels at _num_ am on saturday ?
ok , rant time !

you are incompetent .
my car was ready the following thursday .

disappointed with quantity .
not good .
i just wish i tried this one for lunch not a full dinner .
the sauce was so sweet i thought it was a frozen kid pizza .
the salad , while large , was brown wilted , bagged lettuce .
im just ordering a simple pizza or at least i thought i was anyway .
no such luck .

yelpers , you seriously are high to give this joint anything over _num_ stars .

i tried again about _num_ times within the next hour .
same thing .
ridiculous !
i totally understand that places get crazy busy .
everybody said to go to heritage so i did .
straws ?
their drinks were flat .
not so much a church as a huge theater .
because we were n't apart of the church .
bottom line , this church is full of smoke and mirrors , quite literally .
glory should be given to god , not to a church or its pastor .
god spoke to me and told me to run !
- extremely long wait times .
i showed up this morning at 8:00 on the dot .
do you realize how many disease you can spread like that ?
so i need a haircut .
my neck hurt the entire time .
it should be clean already for their customers .
it drives me crazy !
you are now on my shit list 7th st and bell starbucks .
the latter was very mean .
totally messed up my cut .
why are you avoiding me ?
your company was also kind enough to suggest other insurance companies i should consider .
i am not avoiding you .
after a couple rounds of that i decided to just find everything myself .
this salon is terrible .
i purchased a groupon for a shellac manicure & pedicure .
desperate !
a really terrible place .
the girl who was going to do my massage came out to greet me .
what a complete mess .
unbelievable .
she keep having to clean the polish off my toes .
i also purchased a groupon when they offered it .
_num_ months after my review , the owner posts a comment .
the groupon does n't cover what they had to do to fix my hair .
no it does n't .
do not use this company !
nothing but problems !
not a fan at all .
but restaurant always clean in dining area & staff always friendly .
others just want a quick buck at your expense .
horrible customer service.
Neutral
one is a little chunky and the other is really skinny .
and i feel they talked to you like you were an idiot .
they also overcharge for teeth cleaning .
i would not recommend this vet .
now he is dead .
do not suggest this place .
big mistake !
we found a _num_ week stray kitten by our home last week .
now for the bad .
i said , wait a minute , i see what is going on here .
never a , `` hi , how is the new bike ? ''

terrible staff and management .
dont .
like bat ( you know what ) crazy .
so its probably a walking fest pool _num_ % of the year .
ordered takeout and was not impressed .
she was n't really impressed either .
looks like valle luna from now on .
in the trash .
that was my budget lunch .
first visit was not that impressive .
just horrible .
so , about _num_ stars for the food , _num_ for the service .
if i went back , i would only get the salad .
way too salty .
this night 's meal was beyond a total let down though .
the thai soup staple .
flavorless .
should be sour with some heat .
not spicy .
after trying most of the restaurants here , i 've all but given up .
nothing was even slightly spicy .
the tom yum soup is not tom yum .
it 's ok , but it 's definitely not tom yum .
the instant i tried it , i thought `` this is strange .
i called the restaurant and she said they would make a new one .
i drove all the way back and handed over the original food .
over the last few years they have changed managers several times .
the regional director even sent me an email .
this place has constant management turn over .
i have used this storage facility on and off for ten years .
at all times .
it 's just not worth it .
based on the reviews , this place sounded like a home run .
i was so disappointed !
the meat was all dark meat , and some of it quite fatty .
horrible service too !
will try again if i 'm in the need for delivery .
it is downright awful .
Negative
never returning to this place again !
so i am still sitting here .
then the owner came over to finish my pedicure .
ugh .
worst experience ever .
i was so pissed !
are you kidding me ?
total disappointment !
i went in today to get a pedicure and gel manicure .
even though i opted for the $ _num_ spa pedicure .
this place is awful !
rude and not welcoming !
Negative
i would suggest that nobody goes there .
they are terrible .
_num_ mins to start ordering .
i passed at least a dozen restaurants to get here .
terrible !
very rude serving people .
do not use this company .
food bad .
they brought me a basket with one piece of chicken breast cut in half .
first of all my hair was so long , it touched my butt !
one of the services firestone had recommended was replacing the air filter .
this place is hit or miss .
i used to take all _num_ vehicles to these guys .
no apology no more business .
i went in did the full exam with the upgraded digital eye test etc .
are you kidding me ?
on one of these visits , dr. cook gave my puppy a shot .
i pulled off the freeway to reschedule my appointment .
initially i was completely satisfied , price payment plans staff .
but i 've later it has closed .
about _num_ years ago my dog was in a grooming accident .
very polite and knowledgable !
he gave my dog her shots and everything went smoothly .
this place is gross .
there is nothing fresh about this mexican grill .
i ordered a spicy chicken burrito that was blech !
nothing good about that thing .
i got a fajita burrito and the peppers and onions were boiled .
the chicken was bland .
i hate to be mean .
big mistake .
horrible .
not so good when it comes to execution of a quality haircut .
went in looking for something pretty basic , a shorter disconnected look .
she spent more time asking questions like `` does that look even ? ''
no it is n't !
went to sincerely your hair salon dec 20th ... color already coming out .
went in for a trim and thin .
our waitress finished up her performance by adding up our bill incorrectly .
the place was empty .
i suspect that they are just as attentive to strangers though .
the day before new yrs eve i was craving some good bbq .
i had to stop eating and i thought i was going to die .
not one bit !
i will not be coming back .
came here with friends to satisfy a bbq craving .
i had to pour on bbq sauce .
i had been wanting to have barbeque for awhile .
this was the only place that was close to me .
that was a mistake .
it ran just under $ _num_ .
for my sides i had mac & cheese and baked beans .
had the brisket and the bbq beef sandwich + sides .
everything was no good .
in summary , do n't go here .
the fried rice was simply rice with soy sauce and maybe somewhat fried ?
we should have gone to dq instead .
food was awful .
here is your warning .
the food was mediocre .
horrible service !
the driver seemed friendly enough and made a little small talk at the door .
they recently just switch ownership about _num_ years ago .
nothing special but nothing to complain about .
could have used more sauce and veggies .
not impressed at all .
killing time before meeting friends so i thought i 'd grab a lunch special .
there were four other parties but one was a table of _num_ .
the two servers were hopping , trying to keep up .
fried rice was undercooked .
really disappointed .
ridiculous .
they were nice and the drive through window is convenient .
this was ridiculous .
i typically drop off _num_ - _num_ shirts at a time .
such a shame .
just charged me the $ _num_ instead of the $ _num_ .
horrible customer service .
zero stars .
i was a client of r & r for approximately _num_ years .
i sent text messages and i left messages .
it is with heavy heart i have to leave this sort of review .
he wanted to charge me $ _num_ .
i can not recommend them .
so i waited hoping the atm would figure out i was done .
horrible customer service !
the food we got tonight was laughable .
this is horrible !
no thanks !
i have taken my dog here for extended boarding twice .
sketchy doggie day care .
i came there to get answers , solutions and remedy for my little pup .
that does n't sound like a general practice facility to me .
i will be looking for a new vet for my _num_ dogs .
are you kidding me ?
i brought both of my blue nose pits in due to skin problems .
the doctor pushed pills .
they use the same treatment for every issue for every breed .
i have been a customer of this nail salon for over a year .
last week i called to schedule an appointment .
will never go here again !
rude .
lazy .
i continued to go back week after week because she was good .
in fact , when i find what i like , i 'm loyal .
that 's just lazy !
Positive
people in phoenix must have pretty low standards .
she was just awful !
i was so offended !
i 'm making sure everyone knows how i feel about this credit union .
as was the case tonight .

but there are just some things that need to be brought to attention .
he was nice enough to toss in a free cinnamon twist bag .
closed to the point of even the outside lights being off .
it was a black hole in the parking lot .
the cashier was new so someone helped him which was fine .
she was very snotty when telling me this .
they gave me the crunch wrap .
they always try to up sell extra services that are unnecessary .
seriously ?
only in the fine print of our numerous page contract .
would not recommend .
just waiting for my contract to end .
they are a bit corporate , pushing medical plans for dogs .
an independent vet might be a better choice for many .
it 's not fair for me to compare panda with that , but c'mon !

in reality , i had been given her dress earlier in the day .
this place is gross .

ok breakfast for the money .
older place with a little bit of a smell to it but friendly service .

so i left .
horrible experience .

no further questions ... .
we obviously purchased from them , we had their tank .

horrible customer service .

it 's not rocket science , and it 's not apparent at discount tire .
the worst staff ever .

my kid could probably climb into a unit on the top floor .

not going back here again .
terrible experience .
interior was n't complete .
i purchased a complete interior detail awhile ago after being pressured by the salesman .
it would get done quickly , at most an hour .
he pressured me into purchasing an exterior detail .
the exterior looked the same as it always does after a wash .
i was very disappointed .
unethical business practices .
i will just fix it myself instead of going back there .
i wish i had just gone to a regular place .
how hard is is to call and let me know .
returned on sat .
they were linen , would it have been to much to press ?
i feel sick .

i just want the old outback steak thank you .
out of my face please i am trying to eat here .
outback is not cheap by any means .
there are plenty of other better places to go for steak .

not such a great idea , as it turns out .

probably bay shrimp .
he tried the scampi , buffalo and fried .
we ordered our entrees ( crab stuffed tilapia ) when we received the appetizer .
very bad experience .
my steak was like rubber .
are you kidding me ?
this was terrible .
first time i have tried going to outback for lunch .
so she went back and got another bun .
this was high priced cafeteria food .
just served sirloin surf and turf when we ordered filet .
service a little slow .
this is the second time in an issue with outback this year .
i eat out a bunch i consider myself a foodie .
crab cakes reminded me of potato pancakes .
outback for lunch is for people who despise taste and customer service .
how is coconut shrimp not a safe bet ?

car wash poor .
lazy employees .
_num_ star is being generous .
not worth the price .
horrible cleaning job !
the employees are incredibly pushy to upsell you on a simple car wash .
the car is clean but very spotty .
if you want to throw your money away go to this carwash .
wow !
i was , and still am , very upset over this whole situation .
_num_ .

they agreed to shampoo and was the car for $ _num_ .
i got an exterior wash on my way out of town .
which is a complete run around .
where has customer service gone .
no integrity .
high pressure sales , more than most care washes .
the place is awful !
first time here and was up sold to the ultimate car wash .
not some gigantic suv .
i went today to get a basic car wash .
so far no call .
car still had bugs on the front .
he insisted that they had in fact used it .
i get the monthly pass and i go multiple times per week .
a mud package ?
i really want to try this place based on all the reviews and pictures .
it was very disappointing !

this place is nothing special .
careless , careless barber .

could n't be happier .
had a very specific conversation about how young patients can be .
they deserve one star !
Neutral

went here for my _num_ birthday to sing karaoke .
ruined our night .
just looking for karaoke bars for tonight and saw this place .
still not over it apparently .
wow , wrong .
um , really ?
i may change my review depending on what happens .
my first impression was that it looked a little rundown and not too clean .
there was one other customer getting a pedicure when i arrived .
i handed him the coupon and money .
my toes looked the same as if i did them myself .
the last time i did this was years ago .
this place was horrible !
only a ten minute wait was indicated , so we decided to stay .
eventually , beverage orders were taken .
uninspired .
not all of their air conditioning .
not even close .
tonight was that night .
beware the wait time if you dare to eat here !
nothing special .
the service is lousy .
terrible service but edible food .
worse dennys experience ever .
but will not go back .

well it 's still coming up and feels like it 'll pop off
very impersonal .
not so much as a goodbye or thank you .
rude .
my only issue with it was i considered to be a rather pricy restaurant .
he was not pleased .
i finished the veal and what sauce i could scoop up .
too bad .
mediocre dish with mediocre taste .
the service is sub-par .
i 'm not going back .
pink neon reminds me of some _num_ 's diner .
they closed the location on indian school years ago , for the same reasons .
i stopped back in after being away from julio g 's take out .
had _num_ beef tacos and rice ... .
the fried touch made it not quite crispy , just a little greasy .
i came here last night with two others .
our server was friendly , but not personable .
some people just are n't , and that 's ok .
i wish their spicy salsa was spicier though .
understaffed is never a good thing for a restaurant .
no service .
there are better mexican places .
this is not mexican .
overhead the manager drop the f bomb a few times !
greasy , tasteless food .
too expensive for the quality .
greasy food , aweful guacamole .
so rude .
big mistake !
my bagel + cream cheese was super skimpy on the cream cheese .
it just was n't a good experience .

this place has really gone down .
just nasty !

groupon buyers beware .
these guys are low down little boys !
the food came out in a short time .
very disappointing .
never eat here .
i wish management would notice the issues and make the necessary changes .
however , tonight i decided to try their new california bowl .
i assume it is called the california bowl because of the guacamole .
horrible service .
are you kidding me ?
later i found out that this employee was a manager named daniel .
last three times i have been there it has been this way .
not appealing .
the filing was getting old and i had it redone .
i stayed with her bc i had a routine cleaning coming up .
$ _num_ for a shellac manicure .
it just seems that their techs need more training .

that 's absurd .
good thing i 'm , not dying . ''
boy was i wrong .
drinks are cheap and the bartenders are young & attractive .

useless bullshit .

horrible costumer service .

complete lies .
do not trust this store .
_num_ .
_num_ .

i went back with aaa and they towed the car back to my house .
they put it back together and had my car towed back home .
moving down the road to a new home for car repair .

just awful .
no notice .
i ordered my usual chile relleno burrito .
here they fill the space around the chile with rice cheese and sauce .
this place is terrible .
his chicken burrito did have a couple bones in it .
after all , it is hard to screw up an egg and potato burrito .
it seems like this food would taste much better while drunk or hungover .
went through the drive through for lunch a few weeks back .
had been craving a carne asada burrito .
always glad to find a quick burrito place for those occasional cravings .
food poisoning is awful .
are you freakin ' kidding me ?
but make sure you get your estimate in writing .
i was quoted a price then charged _num_ times more than quoted .
i opened another cabinet and there was a stain inside .
hours in your er for nothing .
no thanks to you .
it seems they just want to milk your insurance .
they do not care about you .
they are very sorry .
she comes in with paperwork for me to sign so that i can leave .
once that was done , i was brought for an x-ray .
i went instead to mayo clinic and so glad i did .

i visited _num_ of them .
rude employees .
another guy in the kitchen area opposite him was facing me .
this was a _num_ second dig .
i was in mesa and tried their other location a week earlier .
a week later i had to give the phoenix location another chance .
worst place for mariscos .
i went to this store which made regret ever being a toys r kid .
i showed him what i ordered and he went to the back .
the supervisor came up , said thats the way it is .
they have that going for them so i give them _num_ stars .
the prices are not good .
it is a pain to return anything here .
they have a good selection but their store is not laid out very well .
also , their customer service is hit or miss .
customer service is rude .
nowhere on their receipt does it say that .
next , the cashier tells me the lights need to be in the box .
but wait she says the lights must be tested .
horrible customer service !
disappointed .
i go to ace in tempe all the time and am always treated professionally .
not the home of the helpful hardware man .
very disappointed !
ugh .
nobody could help me this morning and i was looking for assistance .
so i leave my stuff and say i ca n't wait any longer .
absurd !
will not be back .
repair tech offered $ _num_ off , but frames are still damaged .
will not repeat business here .
i walked and will never return .
bartender not too friendly and it 's a dump !
it was really busy on a sunday .
i assume she washed with water and soap if we 're lucky !
i totally understand that mistakes happen .
felt rushed in and out .
will not be going back .
very poor business !
this ulta is awful !
worst service ever .
thank god they have a return policy .
they never have my make up in stock .
i always have to drive to a location farther away to get it .
she then immediately walked away .
i am writing this review to address my recent visit to your pv store .
once arriving at the said location i was greeted promptly .
and i began my trek through your , seemingly endless , store .
really rude staff .
i went to beauty brands down the street instead to buy the gifts .
pitiful service .
and i 'm sure this lady thinks she deserves $ _num_ an hour .
lame .
still no menus .
i 'm guessing this is the turkey salad .
add battered shrimp or fish depending on the place .
i wish i was joking about the soy sauce or the noodles .
gross and unacceptable .
i would even rate any fast food chain better than this place .
i was in phoenix for _num_ hours a couple of days ago .
this ca n't be right .
not for them !
so i went here for lunch with my boyfriend .
ridiculous .
probably _num_ people in the place .
it was $ _num_ dollars ... .
ridiculous ... .
terrible !
the service was poor .
ugh .
the restaurant is somewhat dingy , and the sushi chefs are not overly responsive .
this is a place clearly in decline .
i could n't even finish my dish .
so sad .
there was a _num_ % `` sushi tax '' .
i signed up on yelp just do dog this place !
literally writing this review as i 'm dining .
ca n't do it again .

wait staff is terrible .
our server was nowhere in sight .
been almost a month ...
went there on a saturday night , waitress was nice .
our waters were never refilled .
this place is horrible .
poor poor poor .
def not going back .
i like to go take out and the fee is silly .
overall a frustrating experience .
i think the place needs some tlc , maybe some new booths .
service was less than professional .
server just did n't care .
this place is a dump and not anything like a professional doctor 's office .
bad customer service .
they 're very unprofessional .
like a living well developed large baby .
this is the rudest clinic i have ever been to in my life .
do not go to this place !
words can not describe how much i dislike this place .
extremely slow .
i would not go there again .
unfortunately i was very disappointed .
not good !
big mistake .
horrible service .
i walked in and waited .
seating was quick , order was taken quickly , salads were delivered quickly .
very poor customer service .
the worst .
do n't waist your time .
probably even lower .
wrong !
the case was nasty .
i could have had pf changs for what i paid at golden wok .
nothing stood out about the place .
mediocre food .
no need to return .
i went here a couple weeks ago and got the sesame chicken .
not peas and carrots !
food tastes alright but it 's certainly not authentic .
dishes were drenched in sauce , egg rolls taste frozen .
the problem was in the entrees .
my brother had a chinese restaurant staple , shrimp with lobster sauce .
do they think that we think this is what fried rice tastes like ?
so unsatisfied !
plus the sales staff are all pushy and overbearing .
not rocket science .
it 's extremely frustrating .
my order was simple - steamed dumplings and wonton soup .
waste of money .
will not be back .
terrible .
terrible .
terrible .
it was gross .
disgusting chinese food .
garbage food !
the worst .
never go to this restaurant .
the only pro was that it was open late .
fried rice ?
yuck yuck yuck .
i used to go here all the time _num_ - _num_ years ago .
big mistake .
one of the dishes had a very greasy and oily after taste .
the whole exam was done in less than _num_ minute .
`` are you sure she 's not on any medication ? ''
they could not care less if you waited forever .
my original reason for coming has n't been resolved .
d & b bowling lanes are better .
'
, _num_ hrs of bowling and shoes .
_num_ .
options and none other .
_num_ .
beers are also expensive at _num_ $ a tall .
that 's ridiculous .
nobody had the opportunity to buy overpriced bowling alley food or beer .
big mistake management .
they are short staffed , never anyone at the food counter .
how disgusting !
they never used to before .
in phoenix or scottsdale & thomas in scottsdale .
the machine is hard to figure out too .
horrible service ... .
horrible service .
danny the gm and taylor are hands down the best employees they have .
worst company to use .
premises not very clean .
will not go there again .
it is completely ruined .
they said it was our brain .
found same part at home depot for $ _num_ .
bad idea .
_num_ minutes for delivery .

also , i 'm pretty sure it was chicken , not pork .
chicken portion was small .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ stars because it 's a sprouts .

complete disappointment and rip off !
first installer was not very friendly .
you 're hungry .
no , you 're starving .
it will only cost $ _num_ , cheapest oil change ever .
disgusting .
the food was awful .
ick .
most every thing was breaded and fried , to fill you up real fast .
pork chops were all hard and dried up , like jerky .
french fries had the breading too .
i left all the breading on my plate and ate the inside .
ick .
i tried the egg drop soup and could taste plastic .
same goes for the fried rice and chow mein .
the chicken were too sour .
sucks .
horrible , never again !
i quickly found out why .
confused .
my favorite is sesame chicken that 's as chinese as my palate gets ... .
way too much attitude .
this guy is a total jerk .
rip off !
according to them , parts were additional .
one step above a hole in the wall buffet place .
the shrimp with lobster sauce was fair , though too salty for my tastes .
i was sorely disappointed .
bland .
all of my fellow yelper 's reviews were so glowing .
bland and mushy .
i 'm thinking damn , it was only a request .
maybe that is why it was me and one more table for lunch .
atmosphere gets a zero .
i 'm thinking damn , it was only a request .
maybe that is why it was me and one more table for lunch .
had large chunks of egg in it .
more like a mexican burrito than chinese .
wo n't be returning .
decor & ambiance very cheap feeling also .
nothing special .
restroom smells foul .
mediocre !
so i passed on that i went to go pick up .
the food is tasty but filled with grease and too much sodium content .
maggie is our favorite bartender around .
stopped bye heard it was good .
Negative
is it me , or did the prices go way up on donuts ?
_num_ per donut ?
horrible customer service .
i really do but , this location bites balls .

the service was horrible .
just not good at all .
when asked how everything was , the server walked away before we could answer .
this place is disgusting .
i 'll not be back .
ordered the so called deep dish .
it was terrible .
so that was disappointing .
the bartender re ran our card for the extra dollar .
this is where you bring your kids to have sit down pizza .
sounds like it 's better to dine in .
im sure there was better service at the bar .
i had the honey brown beer for $ _num_ ; reasonable drink price .
she replied , `` yea , we charge for it . ''
horrible pizza .
could not even force it down .
yep they really know how to please a costumer of _num_ years .
worst service ever .
letter and phone call got me nowhere .
not this place !
how ridiculous .
on my second visit i had some questions about the mouth piece i wear .
lo mein looked good but the box probably had more flavor .
major thumbs down .
half of the order was already cold .
poor food quality .
poor service .
poor delivery .
never going back !
_num_ star is too many .
it was not good .
ordered sweet and sour chicken and pork fried rice .
stop dropping your chopsticks in my front yard !
if you want my business , get better reviews ( i.e .
annoying ... .
i 've never really seen anyone eating in here .
usually upgrade to some fried rice to take things up to the next level .
more or less this place is a meh experience with slight touches of a-ok .
the worst .
dry rice .
after ordering twice , i never ordered again .
terrible place .
she did n't care at all .
horrible family practice .
this one is terrible .
protect yourself , find a better doctor than the ones at this practice .
just unbelievable .
the instructors however , need to learn a bit about customer service .
get off your high horse .
nothing like an ice cold wash .
advice , you will have a better cut at night .
_num_ .
_num_ .
learn a little customer service and teach your students .
this is definitely not my favorite place for breakfast .
the hashbrowns just tasted like potatoes .
i just never understand how people can think this cafe is so great .
it was barely hot .
not my favorite place , and i think it was my last visit .
such a huge disappointment !
i feel so cheated !
meh , disappointing .
rude owners and bad food .
will not go back .
my girlfriend had two eggs , potatoes , and a biscuit .
this place is terrible .
really a zero .
hope bob finds another job not in customer service .
so , suppose you want to give that massage to somebody else .
the worst location !
worst costumer service ever !
our dog only needed his yearly shots and a check up .
what they quoted and what they actually charged was way off !
i called early friday morning to get an appt for my dog .
as i said , very safe place .
here is a rundown on the sports teams .
for me , i would do it all again .
is this place still open ?
worst service ever !
horrible .
nope !
ridiculous .
not cool papa .
lost my business .
my first complaint with this office is wait time .
my son just went to 8th grade there .
if your worried about christian values then teach them at home .
the owners recently hired one of their daughters boyfriend to watch the children .
my step son attended this daycare after his mother found it .
the place smells , its dimly lit and its very very small inside .
gas prices are a little high .
why ca n't they all be equal ?
not coming here again .
( for the higher price of course ) .
was n't good at all .
next time , i 'll stick with pei wei .
stopped by for lunch today , had the teriyaki chicken salad .
that was pathetic .
chicken was fatty .
- cheap and plenty .
i wish i were joking .
i ordered the usual , chicken with vegetables .
it was awful .
stay away from this dump .
horrible .
do n't eat here .
curry sauce was not good either .
everything was terrible .
gross gross gross .
shrimp with lobster sauce was salty beyond words .
like someone through some soy sauce and salt in a pan .
horrible .
terrible .
totally starving this morning .
slow service .
had the _num_ eggs with bacon and biscuits and gravy .
not a fan of this place .
we walked out .
as there were very few people there , lots of open seats were available .
could not pay me to go back !
too pricey for a diner .
very disappointed .
we continued to wait for initial contact with a server .
it was ridiculously hot in that area .
the rest of the restaurant was fine but the entry area was insane .

the building is gone and will soon be another starbucks .
then , when his sandwich came out it had lettuce and tomato on it .

this place is awful .
european size _num_ i said .
so , i arrived in miami and it was time to hit the beach .
it looked nothing like it did in the dressing room !
the lighting must really be off in that store i thought .
i am screwed .
will not be going back .
do n't trust this place !
i guess that would be our last .
no , thanks .
i 've made two trips over there , using my gas and my time .
it was sent back .
very disappointing experience .
_num_ the item was on sale !
i visit a vs store 2-3 times a month .
all she did was continue to ignore and have a dude conversation .
_num_ .
every time i walk in theres like nobody working .
_num_ .
_num_ the victoria secret deals are complicated at this location .
excuse me ?
i was so angry .
it 's _num_ degrees .
i will not be returning again .
they also roll water and sewer into your rent price .
- price may change .
management is rude and unprofessional .
this place is overrated , the food is not authentic at all .
i 'm pregnant and craving mexican .
please let me know your thoughts i am very interested to know .
so disappointed .
my corona was ok too .
we ate about 1/3 before just letting it sit there .
i was not impressed at all .
will not be returning .
nothing was done after that .
not good .
the service is awful .
they need to staff this store with more associates .
luckily they were still under warranty , so it as only $ _num_ .
the lady was also trying to help another waiting customer at the same time .
wrong .
just as others have said i would really give this place _num_ stars .
not having to leave the hotel counts for a lot !
even my beer was warm tonight .
everything else is so-so .
she returned with the cold sandwich and cold fries .
i 'm sorry . ''
Neutral
the menu pricing is not in line with what they charging .
its horrible !
this is pretty bad !
even at the discounted rate we paid , not super satisfied .
next trip to phoenix , i shall be staying anywhere else .
this place sucks !
it 's old baby .
bare dirt would look better .
a lot of repair work needed to walls , carpet , tile , etc .
airport shuttle runs every half hour .
there 's _num_ hilton properties surrounding the phoenix airport .
avoid !
_num_ ) it is in the middle of nowhere .
_num_ ) the room is old .
_num_ ) the bathroom was clean but it had paint peeling .
_num_ ) all of that for $ _num_ a night .
however , the hotel property is dated , and is not kept up .
there is nothing within walking distance besides a bunch of other hotels .
she returned with the cold sandwich and cold fries .
i 'm sorry . ''
both of the drivers were prompt , courteous and helpful .
i 'm going to have to agree with lauren on this one .
the only restaurant in walking distance is a denny 's .
did i mention that the doors here are noisy .
internet service is crap .
do n't need reliable wi-fi ?
the bad !
you can hear the people talk next door .
very disappointing !
but that may have been due to the two areas that were cooking meals .
$ _num_ of gross !
staff is clueless !
they are very cheap on the amount of meats they put on the sandwich .
you get more at subway , if you want to compare .
if you want a really good sub sandwich , go to jimmy johns .
they see me walk in so they come inside .
being new to town , i stopped here on my lunch hour .
the lady at the counter was very helpful , i must say .
very skimpy on the meat and cheese portions .
not to mention both put a lot more meat and cheese on their sandwiches .
sorry , cousins .
however , i have now been in there for the last time .
i recently went in and ordered the philly cheese steak .
this place is garbage .
i was suppose to get _num_ and only got _num_ with everyone else .
i put a deposit and _num_ additional toward move in cost .
the hot tub never worked .
_num_ .
terrible parking !
they only give you one spot ( even with _num_ bedroom apartments ) .
_num_ .
_num_ .
not luxury apartments .
just below average apartments .
pool and spa were also closed a lot because of maintenance .
the tires were reasonably priced but short lived .
worst customer service .
one word -- nightmare !
_num_ .
_num_ .
i have never experienced anything like it before !
the clerk behind the booth was behind metal bars as well .
this was the only hotel i stayed at the time .
my daughter , i and two cats came here .
i 've asked for a smoking room and gave me a non smoking room .
basically you get what you pay for ... .
i 'm never staying at that dump again .
it is very noisy .
worst motel ever .
loud long and irritating .
i 've purchased wood here for years , and recommended this business to friends .
rude .
poor customer service .
inappropriate .
disappointed .
they will knock your socks off !
it 's a disgrace .
yeah , probably , if i was in the neighborhood .
no way .
awful , awful , awful !
i ordered the beef enchilada platter .
instead of red or green sauce they used some kind of brown gravy .
the food is n't especially memorable .
i will try something different and maybe i might change my mind .
yep , sketchy and a little ghetto i thought .
unfortunately i was disappointed .
i ordered a chorizo , egg , potato & bean burrito .
there are a hundred mexican joints in the valley as good or better .
nothing special there .
plus you get to eat off of styrofoam to go boxes .
the bean and cheese burro was run of the mill fast food mexican .
i wouldnt go out of my way for these .
skip it !
in fact , i left most of it where i found it .
if there is good food , it does n't matter .
so , that was a little deceiving .
i ordered the green chile beef , which i was looking forward to .
so , no .
i am pretty much done trying to eat at this restaurant .
very very very bad !
i will only go to the cave creek location from now on .
nothing to write home about .
!
the meal just was n't very good .
you really ca n't beat the prices here .
when i got here _num_ person in line ( ahead of me ) .
i 'm not a big fan of their rice or beans .
i have been a loyal customer for the last _num_ years .
i was really disappointed .
hot and dirty .
i will not be going back .
i was n't impressed by either .
went here on my way back from the airport .
had the # _num_ taco , beef enchilada and tostada .
they were just awful .
the masa was even dry .
eaten here on two occasions , about ten years apart _num_ & _num_ .
will not be returning .
_num_ registers , one for in store orders and one for to-go .
the place was packed and it was somewhat challenging to find parking .
we ordered fried catfish , fried chicken and country fried steak .
corn muffin was dry .
ass drops was more like it .
i mean , horrible .
disappointing .
i saved my discussion of kung pao chicken for last .
it tasted of celery , if anything at all .
completely disgusting .
the waitress was a complete jerk as well .
not worth $ _num_ .
felt like they gave me reheated food .
i read the reviews and i thought i would take the chance .
we wore the smell of the place like when one visits the casino .
do n't like smelling as chinese food so got home and took shower asap .
when i say fried rice , i mean just that .
nothing more , nothing less .
way too much oil .
these are not crab puffs .
i only ate two .
soooo , thanks for the let down yelpers .
_num_ stars ?
is this place permanently closed ?
poor service .
there are cab companies in phoenix that you can rely on .
big mistake .
i called the night before my flight and asked for a 6:30 am pickup .
i ended up having to scramble and drive myself to the airport .
would not recommend to anyone .
that cab driver was nice though .
by the way , i had reserved the cab the night before .
worst cab experiences ever !
are you kidding me ?
are you kidding me ?
it 's now past my original reservation time .
rates to the airport are a different rate than `` street rates '' .
what a train wreck .
_num_ minutes ?
i could have walked there by now !
_num_ .
never using yellow cab again .
if only they could pick me up on the way back .
f & ( $ you .
and get your credit card machine fixed , you fool .
no cab .
tells me i need to talk to someone in dispatch .
avoid at all costs .
annoying but whatever .
no luck .
i have used this cab company several times for trips to phx airport .
ridiculous !
Neutral
they are never polite and courteous .
i jumped out and pulled my luggage out of the trunk .
i am disappointed .
shame on this company !
gave my cash tip and went on my way .
worst cab ride ever .
Positive
the driver says yes , of course , and i get in .
ugh .
absolutely ridiculous .
they deserve a zero !
i know that , i 've gone to the airport dozens of times .
there are so many choices in the valley guys , look at these reviews .
do not ever take yellow cab .
his car was disgusting .
worst cab service ever .
please someone just put them out of service already .
Negative
i really tried so very hard to like you .
he asks which apartment i 'm in .
he tells me he was `` just following the gps '' .
it says that price tonight , march _num_ , on the newly updated website .
but i damn sure know how to locate a business name !
cash only , but better than any green , or yellow options .
`` why not $ _num_ ? ''
as we got off the _num_ at scottsdale rd .
made the driver drop me at the dennys and called discount cab .
unbelievable .
it 's shame .
horrible rude snotty phone dispatch .
when i asked for a supervisor , i was put on hold .
just took a cab ride from phx to tempe with cab _num_ .
had to grab a taxi from phx after coming home from grandmother 's funeral .
_num_ mins later i called ... .
i did not inquire why .
it 's now past my original reservation time .
rates to the airport are a different rate than `` street rates '' .
what a train wreck .
_num_ . )
lazy piece of shit .
ca n't wait until uber takes them under .
this is a zero .
credit card machine went down .
sold me a car that was ready to blow up .
this is where i found out the mechanics here are n't certified .
shady mechanic telling me one thing and doing another .
they create problems with your car and never find the real issue .
plus their mechanics stole my dr pepper from my trunk !
they create problems with your car and never find the real issue .
plus their mechanics stole my dr pepper from my trunk !
like another reviewer here , i was very excited to try this place out .
fish filets are not square .
bad customer service .
the food looks like fucking gordon 's fish sticks from the frozen food box .
i feel like im in a school cafeteria !
it was just so weird .
when i arrived , i was treated the same way the other reviews described .
i would not return to azteca .
the cost for alterations at azteca was about $ _num_ .
so i asked that it be ready _num_ weeks prior .
it was not good .
i visited azteca bridal this weekend in hopes of finding my wedding dress .
the service sucked !
so frustrating .
do not step foot in here .
with no explanation .
as soon as i got there i got this s ghetto prom vibe .
terrible bridal experience .
azteca has been around for as long as i remember .
the customer service is non-existent , do n't expect to be greeted .
i give this bridal salon _num_ stars .
probably the thing i disliked most about this store was my consultant .
very disappointing .
the owners were rushing our girl to hurry up .
terrible customer service .
cheap prices for cheap service .
all i can say was she was african american .
so we wait .
no kidding .
amazingly disappointing .
horrible experience !
ended up at luv bridal where i was treated right and listened to .
this was not great .
not even good .
the meat is very hard .
no luck .
i will not recommend this place .
very disappointing .
_num_ stars .
beans not good at all .
expensive and horrible food .
im use to sliced beef instead of shredded .
very dry .
ribs : now the ribs i can get behind .
however , i should n't have .
i do not recommend this restaurant .
if you want good bbq , go to little miss bbq !
the ribs are crap .
i have stopped by here on the way home several times .
no lettuce no tomato .
i did decline the mayo mustard and got a little bbq sauce .
tried the pulled pork sandwich , rib tips , and potato salad .
i ordered the chicken n ribs dinner .
i chose coleslaw and garlic toast .
overall experience was just ok .
the chicken was also ok .
there may have been one salad option , too .
avoid !
i was pissed off .
my advice -- decline everything when renting a car from this company .
or renting a car in phoenix period .
i never want to use budget there again .
after a four day rental my taxes and fees were roughly $ _num_ .
it was about _num_ miles more .
walked past a lot of companies and they may have had ( maybe ? )
so disappointed .
never use budget .
never use budget .
better yet , buy and sell a used car while you 're in phoenix .
it would take less time than the shuttle and rental counter .
it does n't matter that you have a coupon .
just , no .
budget should replace him immediately , or they will continue to loose more customers .
so i recently rented a car from my local hertz .
our number was _num_ .
ridiculous .
if that 's the case , then hire more agents to help your customers .
rude employees also !
unbelievable ... ... waited an hr for the bus from the terminal .
all these years of travel , first time renting a car .
nothing at this agency was clearly explained .
shame on you budget !
remember , there are many car rental choices available .
every other company i could have walked up and rented a car .
horrible waits , bad service .
to put another driver on the vehicle was more than twenty per day .
then i called from st louis where we landed .
all she needed to do was say that they looked at the video tape .
customer service lacks !
bad customer service !
rude and pushy !
too many other choices .
that is the same amount as my car note .
budget sucks .
picked up the car got in line to exit and the nonsense continues .
unbelievable .
the _num_ minute wait here to get a car is outrageous !
horrible horrible company !
you know it do n't cost _num_ $ to detail a car !
i recently rented a car while in the area for thanksgiving .
rented a car over thanksgiving .
returned without problem .
they can not be trusted .
given ticket for _num_ min wait .
avoid this company .
whatever , dude .
watch for fraud .
impossible to reach by phone .
she was just horrendous .
Negative
a reservation apparently is not a real reservation here .
they were on number _num_ .
ridiculously long line and wait at phoenix airport !
miserable cars .
they refused .
so i was expecting a charge of about $ _num_ total .
frustrating experience .
do not recommend this location .
little did i know that the mini van was a super deluxe kia .
i have _num_ chances to budget .
horrible service .
you even take the same bus to get to them all .
horrible !
seriously budget get your act together !
_num_ hours and counting !
maybe get more people or do n't over sell during peak times .
worse car rental place .
happens every time i am here for spring training .
i was number _num_ and number _num_ was being served .
what a nightmare .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
this is ridiculous .
unacceptable .
horrible crooks !
they came out twice within a month to fix our pool .
we put _num_ into minor parts and used it last night .
i selected swimming pool service and repair based on yelp reviews .
trying to get a new gate installed , along with an automated opener .
warranty service- less than _num_ months after install my gate stops working .
what terrible service !
crap .
crap .
crap .
horrible layout .
crap .
crap .
crap .
pretentious and condescending writing .
it 's time to stop playing high school newspaper .
not rating new times specifically , but their friday food truck event .
those books ... er , never mind ) .
time was , locals would look forward to thursdays to get a new times .
i also was expecting hushpuppies and grits for the price .
maybe , but i will only order the fish .
my dad had fried okra and fried zucchini .
the cole slaw was pretty much like what you buy at the deli counter .
skip the chicken .
_num_ .
any local chinese buffet will give you shrimp for a lot less than that .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
this is not it folks .
you 'll be better off .
the food is horrible !
horrible !
fries were soggy and bland .
Neutral
no taste buds ?
the last time i entered was was cuz purely by accident .
ate here on a friday night with a friend .
the place was busy which is usually an okay sign .
the fries could have been better .
to me it just came across as grumpy management .
this place was horrible !
go elsewhere for seafood .
not impressed .
but at least it also looks like a dive from the inside too .
she did really like the fish though .
that was the slightly redeeming factor .
disgusting .
fish is too thick for batter .
went in for lunch on june 2nd .
so she starts to push buttons and has a little attitude about it .
do i recommend no .
only good on fridays .
in _num_ , they did it again to our home in goodyear .
this was slightly better , but not by far .
looked like it had never been cleaned .
i 'm not holding my breathe !
horrible horrible horrible company .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
it can get crowded , but hey , it 's an airport .
otherwise , if you must travel through this airport , take america west .
the terminal sucks .
there 's just one big bus to hop onto .
ok , end rant .
i hate it .
when i travel , i tend to have things .
yeah , i 'm totally ready to hop on a plane now .
only americans would know that .
it was almost easier to just drive there from san diego than to fly .
i wish you could still meet people at the gates without a ticket .
sky harbor is like any other airport .
one time i was picking someone up - had them on the cell phone .
i wish i had run him over .
if i die , i die .
where this terminal is the best is in the choice of food and drinks .
this is where terminal _num_ shines .
not much to see here , really .
i only spent time in terminal _num_ as that 's where delta is .
boo to this airport and its eating choices , boo !
i dread each trip i have to take to this place .
and the shuttles are not as frequent as they could be .
ok , let 's try to kill two hours layover on phx .
it is dull and boring .
it is n't rocket science .
for me the major issues are driving through the airport .
the terminals are not user friendly .
people are freaking rude .
what really scared me were the birds in the southwest terminal .
disgusting and dirty .
and the north curb and south curb ?
the whole place , inside and out , appears to be very cluttered .
i 'm not done !
had a layover here ... _num_ hours !
did not enjoy it .
no big deal .
they 're _num_ miles apart .
okay , not really .
no waiting .
not a fan .
not a huge deal , right ?
wrong !
lame !
thats fucking pathetic and sad .
the walk is only about _num_ yards .
except that you have to exit security , and walk outside to get there .
the restaurant selections are limited .
!
i 've never flown out of sky harbor .
so why only two stars ?
they need to remember that most people do n't frequent the airport .
better plan on a long wait there too .
not so much a fan of this airport .
the furniture and dcor need some serious updating .
thats it in my terminal worth mentioning .
bathroom doors do n't lock .
so not true .
leave lots of time if you are using a rental car !
whether i 'm on time , late or early .
having all the food outside of said security = extremely inconvenient .
sky harbor , you lose .
do not collect $ _num_ .
no cookie for you .
the food sucks .
parking is a nightmare .
what a nightmare .
especially when you have to reach terminal _num_ .
atmosphere : clean facilities but nothing spectacular .
- car rental return lanes through the airport is confusing .
return factor - _num_ % , but not by choice .
phoenix , phoenix , phoenix .
you sure worked hard to make me dislike you .
but flying out of phoenix .
`` no sir .
he also tells me i am going to miss my flight .
sky harbor needs a closed airport layout .
denver ) they need workers out in the terminal gates assisting travelers .
never again sky harbor !
the airport needs some good upgrading in the near future .
so , in all , sky harbor , you disappoint me !
i 'm not joking .
this gave me plenty of time to wander around phoenix sky harbor .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
ridiculous .
( it is set up like a giant u .
not a huge airport , the food options are regular old airport food options .
there is nothing simple about this airport .
employees are not helpful .
i hate this airport .
horrible .
in order to get from terminal to terminal , you need to walk .
i hate these people .
so i do n't like it here .
that 's just disgusting .
another tsa agent directed me where to go .
the food is meh , the terminal layout is meh .
it 's easy to get to from downtown and scottsdale which is a plus .
the rental car facility requires a bus transfer but it 's pretty quick .
bravo to them ... it is the only decent place in sky harbor .
do n't fly through phoenix .
bad , bad experience .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ where are the seats ?
_num_ minute flight home from vegas and 30+ minute wait on baggage .
the restrooms are ok but usually crowded .
first off , the seating area for continental airlines is really small .
adding wi-fi , some better restaurants , etc .
it is the outside of the airport that is a big problem .
it is insanely frustrating .
the whole airports needs an overhaul .
very confusing airport .
services offered while waiting for your next flight ?
then there 's the restrooms .
gross .
the terminals feel drab and dingy .
seriously though , entering this airport feels like taking a step back in time .
that 's what sky harbor feels like .
speaking of food , the restaurant selection here is abysmal .
this airport really sucks .
_num_ degrees .
even oakland upgraded ... get with it phoenix !
not impressed .
yup , just about what i expected from phoenix .
it was just ridiculous .
i flew into the phoenix airport on a southwest flight .
all of the information boards only provided flight information for that terminal .
dumb .
even the club closes relatively early .
did i mention that the four terminals are not connected in any way ?
most confusing airport ever !
just very poor signage .
this i can not understand .
either requires a bus trip .
that is a big pet peeve of mine .
that is enough reason not to fly here .
this is _num_ .
pathetic .
the food sucks .
it feels like it was designed by some kids on a beach somewhere .
driving into phoenix would be much better .
this time it was on the southwest side !
unimpressed .
the airport is also confusing .
it 's obnoxious .
annoying .
over the next hour i cant believe what takes place .
i land in terminal c and have to get to terminal d .
_num_ ) get to gate as they 're closing the gate .
_num_ ) change the gate on my new ticket again ... twice !
they need updating , more power outlets , renovated bathrooms , etc .
horribly designed airport .
its spread out pretty far and wide ( lots of walking ) .
i 've never been a fan of phoenix 's sky harbor .
bad airport .
not friendly at all .
lack of power outlets .
my boyfriend and i recently had a layover here .
dave goes to new mexico part _num_ .
worst airport ever .
i hope i never had a layover here again .
sorry , phx .
no checked bags .
people hate smokers .
now i 'm cranky and hungry , but everything is too expensive here .
ca n't wait to leave !
i 've never gone through security here before .
they only looked at my boarding pass .
but the alternative is to risk watching someone leave a bag behind .
it 's just weird .
just an airport like lax .
do n't even want to give one star .
shocking , really .
one of my least favorite airports .
the rental car building is a long bus ride away .
this airport is bad .
i must have walked over a mile to find everything closed .
even if things were open , there are very few choices for decent food .
ugh .
i just hate this place .
meh , it 's functional i guess .
so when i left hawaii everything was cool .
if anything , _num_ for free wifi that 's actually pretty fast .
things like dining options , free wifi , charging outlets and seating areas .
ugh .
horrible experience .
dont fly out of this terminal .
amazing !
this airport is a bitch to get around walking or driving .
that ended up being a _num_ foot by _num_ foot safe .
unacceptable and completely ridiculous .
glad they have an information desk .
i hate this airport !
i hate this airport .
you can show up here _num_ hours early and miss your flight .
not just you , like your whole plane full .
seriously , many phx folks drive to tucson .
it has become the airlines that cater to dogs better than they do people .
not so much .
i 've been to better county airports .
every time i come here it 's another experience to forget .
_num_ .
_num_ , than _num_ , than back to one .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .

first , it 's been remodeled .
i really could have used a starbucks .
this airport is horrible .
fail .
fail .
fail .
worst airport design .
not a fan of this airport .
ugh .
not a great airport .
would n't necessarily recommend .
the seats are not upgraded in the terminal like many other airports .
the people in the terminal are kind and just step over , etc .
nothing special .
the lines were slow .
old airport and really confusing to get around in it or around it .
it 's just an old dingy , sticky airport .
it just needs some tlc to bring it back .
the d terminal is only one arm .
horrible .
they try to con you into buying their total insurance package .
my least favorite airport when flying east .
i just hate how hard it is to get to the different terminals .
not a great airport .
additionally , the rental car facility is a long way from the airport .
i never thought of that ! '' )
and annoying .
tsa is set up in hallways .
horrible .
the mexican resturant had a line out the door , _num_ deep .
really bad airport .
tsa is set up in hallways .
horrible .
the mexican resturant had a line out the door , _num_ deep .
_num_ % of the flights we travel through sky harbor are delayed .
who makes gates where seating is limited to half the people on the plane .
worse layover yet .
i travel frequently and never has a flight left on time .
the air conditioner is not on .
this airport is terrible .
not enough outlets !
i wish i had caught his name .
ugh .
my least favorite airport .
terminal _num_ is by far the least comfortable .
i dread entering phx .
its not that hard .
if you have any other options , do n't fly into this airport .
never again southwest .
from there we went to the air terminal store to pick up some items .
when arriving at the airport last week , check in was simple and quick .
so following _num_ sets of requests at the same time is a little difficult .
_num_ mins .
later , and now _num_ mins .
so overall my experience fell short due to the staff more than anything else .
this airport sucks .
not many shops or restaurants to choose from to kill time before your flight .
not impressive but enough for a small child to be excited .
worst airport experience ever .
first , there are very few premium amenities at phx .
sky harbor rates low with this seasoned traveler .
the _num_ stars are for terminal _num_ only .
terminal _num_ is a totally different story .
horribly outdated .
terrible transportation between terminals .
useless wifi .
not enough restrooms or restaurants .
they need to upgrade and build areas where you can charge your phone .
not acceptable .
so few options in terminal _num_ for dining or killing time .
bathrooms at this airport are few and far between .
there could be better food choices .
however , the phoenix sky harbor tsa agents need better training .
until i flew out of phoenix sky harbor .
all the good restaurants are outside of security ... which is very inconvenient .
not my favorite airport .
ca n't wait to see sky harbor during high tourist season .
no free wifi either .
big low score for tsa .
unbelievably inept tsa staff !
they deserve a minus star rating .
thanks phoenix airport for the long wait at the tsa check in .
airport itself is very old old old .
it 's _num_ pm at night !
horrible airport !
i have a special need ... to not miss my flight !
open _num_ hours , ha !
but seriously , when there 's nothing even open ?
should i eat my money ?
there is nothing modern , comfortable , or clean about terminal _num_ .
this airport is the pits .
this place had _num_ , one security line during the thanksgiving weekend .
outlets are also limited at the gates , so plan accordingly .
one hour wait through security .
just try not to ever rent a car here !
no thank you phx .
it was a really stressful way to end a great vacation in arizona .
do n't expect any great eateries .
probably _num_ different airports .
lax , my least favorite would get a _num_ star rating compared to this .
so confusing .
it was a nightmare .
inside , was worse .
too much visiting among the tsa staff to take care of the travelers .
just terrible .
Neutral
it was ridiculously understaffed and took nearly two hours .
least impressive to me was the food selection .
i put this airport as one of my least favorite large city airports .
rental car facilities are far from the airport and hotel shuttle service is spotty .
)
Neutral
very poor wifi .
nothing impressive at all .
horrible , horrible , horrible experience .
wrong , wrong wrong .
not even a tissue ! ''
i get anxiety just thinking about it .
_num_ arrival for _num_ gal of jet a and a quick turn .
the dog volunteers and front desk were so friendly .
do not support this organization !
that is not allowed .
such a shame .
we adopted a dog from this facility in the beginning of december .
totally shady operation .
very easy to miss .
still a _num_ % shady company , still stand by my review _num_ % .
the shuttle are fairly frequent and prices reasonable .
i could n't believe it .
i 'm very unsatisfied .
cheap but that 's it .
but , i 'll get to that in a minute .
not even close in fact .
so ... actually ... in my book ... not ... free .
ridiculous .
we had to wait forever to be picked up on our return trip .
worst experience ever !
it 's a little further away but looks way nicer and more secure .
every other parking facilities shuttle has been by 2-3 times .
horrible service !
we booked a covered parking spot online and printed our reservation .
pay the little extra and get better service .
beware of letting drivers handle your luggage for you .
they always insist , trying for bigger tip , which i understand .
terrible customer support .
had to wait for 3rd shuttle first _num_ full already !
i have used this service several times .
unfortunately ( ? )
horrible .
just horrible .
so not worth it .
anyway , that 's another review .
horrible service !
the staff behind the counter were polite , but just so .
damned inconvenient since my room was at the far end away from the office .
overall horrible experience .
i left an _num_ % tip .
writing this review breaks my heart .
i tried it again several months later - same thing .
if not , go to morton 's for the money .
i just was n't impressed .
for dessert , i ordered the chocolate mousse and my husband ordered the cheesecake .
my husband had to flag him down and request our bill .
my girlfriend and i ate here in _num_ .
it 's totally not .
cow rug , leather , old cowboy photos on the wall .
i ordered a half slab of ribs with garlic potatoes and a salad .
i would n't do dinner again .
got there about 5:30 left at 7:00 .
very slow service .
the _num_ oz .
sad salad .
avoid this place .
they knocked off an iced tea and one alcoholic drink .
the bread basket contained biscuits and jalapeno corn bread .
frozen seafood and sauce out of a jar for _num_ bucks .
my first visit to this steakhouse was a company lunch .
filet med with a little pink in the middle .
did not even offer me another filet .
the steaks are n't hot .
the veggies are n't fresh .
yikes , bad call .
it was just ok .
however , i would suggest spending the extra and having a far superior meal .
the place was just average but at top prices .
i will not be back .
horrible horrible horrible !
food forgotten .
sides also were unimpressive .
horrible service !
extremely rude !
no flavor .
it 's extremely mushy .
however , their bacon is like dust .
designated spot is actually between doors & and _num_ causing unnecessary confusion .
trying to book _num_ days of parking .
very poor business practice .
i 'm rating only their parking service .
guess not .
this is junk !
called and got an answering machine .
i will never use this shuttle .
would not recommend .
why ca n't you have a sign ?
avoid !
some were attractive .
i do n't recommend at all .
the decor is very _num_ 's and never updated .
_num_ out of _num_ stars .
lastly , never get the coleslaw .
_num_ out of _num_ stars .
if you 're going during happy hour , however , then it is .
spend your money elsewhere .
i almost just got cold stone for breakfast .
a nice green chili burrito sounded just right for 9am .
$ _num_ after tax , that 's what i got .
the burrito was surprisingly small .
after every bite .
like most airport restaurants , it looks clean .
my hispanic food passion of late is a guacamole burrito .
it 's guacamole , onion , cheese , sour cream and bacon .
beats burger king any day .
worst customer service ever .
wrong .
wrong .
i get the jumbo jack with cheese and i like the egg rolls .
last time through the drive thru i asked for ketchup .
i get back to work and their are three packets in the bag .
gross !
i need to stop coming here just because it 's close to work .
and annoying .
rude to the max .
all these _num_ star reviews , he probably posted himself .
no way .
being nice goes a long way .
probably not .
this is a new company to me .
there 's a reason this company gets _num_ stars .
they were too busy trying to upsell .
problems checking car back in on return .
will never rent again .
rented from them a year ago , thought i 'd try it again .
nothing really stood out for me except the prices .
my wait to get my internet reserved car was longer .
avoid at all costs !
this was my first time renting from advantage .
first as a student .
it is also a trap job for anyone looking to grow in the organization .
they could n't understand that .
this place is not military friendly .
this college sucks .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it should not work that way .
they were good when they were gas carts .
such a pity because it 's a really cool environment .
place is extremely boring .
nothing is the same after they moved to this new location .
did i mention how expensive it is ?
they do n't care !
this is no different .
price difference $ _num_ .
the drive-thru sign was on , but the open sign was off .
overall , it 's a nice , little fish and chips place .
the breading covering the fish was like bird food .
the service was bad .
overall , disappointing .
nothing special .
cooked just right & crunchy as expected .
not impressed at all .
they told me _num_ mins .
fries were soggy .
, bad .
ranch not homemade .
he printed out our tickets , which said we were confirmed .
and they 'd have to find the bus station in the dark - shoot .
if you do , confirm them , as the schedule may change .
there was some scary looking food sitting under heat lamps in the cactus caf .
by the time we boarded our bus , many seats were taken .
so i suggest buying your tickets ahead of time to get the best rate .
but my advice is stay home or walk to your destination .
bought his ticket online and showed up at the phoenix terminal this morning .
am i missing something ?
)
no help !
after this trip i am never getting on a bus again .
one star is entirely too many !
the bus got to phoenix , and there my son stayed !
pathetic !
first , i called ahead to make sure i got priority seating .
did n't i pay for this wifi ?
seriously difficult to deal with these people .
this trip i was simply trying to save money .
this is the 3rd station i 've ever been in .
terrible customer service .
worst greyhound yet .
do not use greyhound !
not even as last resort .
my bus is over four hours late and i 'm so livid right now .
the absolute worst !
avoid greyhound if you can .
they are horrible !
this is not the first time either .
horrible .
rude staff and disgusting bus .
Negative
what the hell ?
for a place open _num_ hours it was a welcome site .
we arrived and sat down at the counter looking over the menu .
the orange juice was in buckets ready to be refilled .
overall , i thought it was a little creepy and disturbing in the restaurant .
the food was not good .
i would only return to a waffle house if this was my only option .
the food is mediocre .
we got our food really spread out too .
i came here tonight ( a tuesday evening around 5:00 ) .
_num_ star is too much .
sorry , america .
i had cheesy eggs , hash browns , raisin toast , bacon and coffee .
he had _num_ waffle , bacon , eggs , hash browns and biscuit .
wish i had followed my first mind and went to ihop 's .
oh , just drive to the one on the _num_ and university .
it was pretty disgusting .
sadly i was mistake .
overall bad people .
they sell everything without tax and are overall thieves .
same thing .
same thing .
only _num_ minutes ?
he was on time , polite , and knowledgeable .
no ? )
appointment with my primary care doctor last months too !
aaa transportation cabs & discount cabs totally !
this company is terrible .
not a sparkling review by any means .
it was cab _num_ .
she was told _num_ min .
the decor was ... plain .
oh right ... not a westin ... i keep forgetting .
i will not stay here again .
he also says we can have _num_ % off another stay .
secondly , the wi-fi had some problems at this hotel .
too pricey for the kind of service they offer !
the carpets in the rooms are getting very dingy too .
stay away from room _num_ .
eh ... not sure .
the work they do is downright embarrassing .
it was stale .
but my sandwich was just ok.
there is a _num_ cent additional fee for cards .
_num_ weeks latter i get a email requesting payment .
i informed the salesman that a final inspection has not been done .
bad customer service !
not exaggerating !
zero stars !
overall , it was a really disappoint experience .
anyways , the soup was broccoli and cheese .
total was _num_ bucks .
not impressed .
the coffee is awful !
the sandwich was reasonably thick with meat , greens and tomatoes .
at least the food would be good and the service predictable .
the girl was very accommodating , so i ordered the spinach salad without bacon .
i was boarding a late flight with only this place open .
ordered a pick _num_ combo with a smoked turkey sandwich and a southwestern salad .
so awful .
also ordered pick _num_ for my dining partner .
it was just chunks of fat and gristle .
so , so gross .
terrible , terrible service !
)
maybe i 'm just spoiled ... .
i ordered the turkey cranberry half sandwich and broccoli cheddar soup .
trust me , i looked multiple times .
paradise bakery in terminal _num_ c concourse is .
the worst .
it 's like everyone here is sour on their job .
lame company .
who really has time to stay home from 8am to 2pm waiting for them .
plus , they were super late past that six hour waiting period .
do n't recommend .
bad service .
uh , unacceptable .
so , i was only trying to get a shorter time .
i have my glasses picked out and i needed them to drive .
i approached one of the sales associates and her attitude switch was on .
she was extremely rude .
thumbs down .
nope , no , nada !
angry .
hello , ford motor co !
goodbye bell ford in phoenix , az .
poor customer service .
fake promises .
overall waste of time .
this place is horrible .
they are awful .
the staff in the used car department obviously judge you by your appearance .
have n't heard from them so i 've made an appt .
i recently was there with a friend looking at cars .
from now on , i 'll drive further for better service .
disappointed in phoenix !
we have a job that requires us to travel most all of maricopa county .
no more .
( _num_ calls now over the past week ) .
each time i am promised a return call .
was passed off between _num_ sales reps during visit .
very disappointing .
this place is an old horse track through and through .
that said , this place is an old horse track through and through .
service sucked .
nothing was comped .
to top it off , the second race a horse got hurt .
terrible ... so sad !
its falling apart .
do not use this company !
then i remembered , i had come in for tooth pain .
the atmosphere was mixed , children playing along side adults .
it should only cost five dollars for locals .
i talked to arcade tech and he said that is what the game does .
no help .
the people before me has that problem as well .
not worth the price .
the day we went , several rides were closed .
nowhere on their site does it say the coupon is n't valid today .
waste of money .
$ _num_ for unlimited rides ?
also , the beverages are outrageously priced .
most modern games area priced more than $ _num_ each play .
but as is it feels like a tourist trap .
are you kidding me ?
not worth it at all .
the management deserves _num_ !
employees deserve a place to sit as well as patrons .
employees are rude and impatient .
never going back .
the place was pretty clean , not too crowded and prices were fine .
i went not expecting much and left feeling lucky i was alive .
apparently , they forgot to call me .
that 's not right . ''
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the hole in my windshield looked large enough to stick a head through it !
and , this was n't it .
how is _num_ customer service a business model ?
poor customer service .
absolutely terrible and deceptive .
such an amateur mistake .
horrible service !
the list goes on .
instructors are rude .
the driver showed up right on time which was great .
better luck with your driver !
yes , sir , like toppings and stuff .
so i joined him for lunch .
$ _num_ beer if you order lunch .
rent must be really really low .
which is why we gave it a try .
ok , but not quite that good .
i think that would be it , yet it almost sounds too positive .
the only really good thing i got there once was their big breakfast .
ick !
gross !
it was like the black hole of coffee condiments .
nasty , nasty , nasty .
_num_ mins in line .
Negative
this seems very expensive as compared to a competitor .
they did n't really care though .
i used classic party rentals for my wedding .
do n't bother .
pointing does n't tell me anything .
not a bunch like she claimed .
um , rude .
my friend was installing it for me .
asked one employee ( red shirt ) for a screw for a bumper .
very poor service .
terrible !
i 've never witnessed anything like this in my life .
worst customer service ever .
thanks but no thanks .
so i drive from casa grande , az .
was a horrible experience .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
my car rarely breaks down !
but we would be left paying the towing .
bottom line is they just were n't doing the job .
same thing happened to my dad .
it was really dirty .
the sauce was so-so .
it 's just that the food is not special .
horrible customer service !
mediocre tacos .
the baked goods on the other hand , i 'll be back to try .
highly disappointed today .
everyone else ordered burritos , i bet they were delicious .
not going back .
i refuse pay for anymore services from firestone !
took the techs almost _num_ hours to do a simple oil change .
it was very easy to find this so called company .
so far not really a problem .
is not covered .
i figured i would just let the whole thing go .
she just starts talking over me .
so i go ahead and give him a sample .
finally , she brings out the invoice .
no thanks !
very deceptive marketing practices and high pressure sales .
it 's not really `` mexican food '' .
horrible seafood .
horrible martinis .
the food was mediocre .
we have mixed reviews , ourselves , though .
there are fish tanks with large fish in them .
otherwise , skip it .
they gave me cold mac and cheese .
worst service ever .
we ordered egg rolls and my husband said this was his favorite thing .
i did n't like it .
the last thing we ordered was the vegetable fried rice .
boring .
the total bill was $ _num_ .
enough food to feed _num_ people at least .
do not go here at all .
this place is disgusting .
that was n't the case today .
they give me the number of the closest pizza hut .
down to _num_ of us .
i grab my pizzas and i 'm out of there .
pizza was never delivered .
Neutral
when it finally arrived it was cold .
not even luke warm .
it 's a complete joke .
no reason why .
Negative
worst service .
smh
you 've been warned .
i dont think these people are not aware of what they eat .
for me , it is all about first impressions .
they scheduled a project specialist to come out that week .
the specialist called me and confirmed the appointment .
he was very knowledgeable and polite .
finally , i get a call that evening .
i urge you to get other estimates especially in the tucson area .
the buyer 's inspector noted a few issues with the replaced roof .
the sales guy apparently cant add .
i approved , not having a better choice .
the tile from the bone yard was delivered .
do not hire this company !
i was so wrong .
the prices are not great compared to the service of the store .
i will have to keep looking for a reliable small engine mechanic .
they do n't even deserve one star .
nothing else to say ... .
left empty handed .
fairly mediocre .
worst customer service ever !
i explained that nobody had taken my order at the speaker .
this they could handle without a problem .
it seems that that 's all they 're capable of doing .
april _num_ : god damn you .
and my tacos were crammed with lettuce .
tacos are now _num_ cents .
it was 11pm and we had just gotten back from the phx airport .
this del taco is n't in the best place of town .
i like del taco it reminds me of might taco in buffalo ny .
the dang sour cream cost as much as the tacos but i like it .
go next door to taco bell or whataburger .
not only about when they close , but when they open .
del taco you need more professional involved with your company .
worst pharmacy , ever !
so my boyfriend was the first to report it ?
they have decent thick cut fries , but not the best .
but the flavor was a bit off .
this place sucks .
just got back from lunch after trying it for the first time .
service was bad .
overwhelmed staff at lunch rush .
not given receipt or ketchup for my fries .
if i want a chain style sandwich i would opt for cheba hut .
no fresh brewed tea .
i do n't intend to go back .
we were talking about the _num_ % and _num_ % screens .
so , he did the measurements same day .
i could n't believe it .
friday was the only day it could be done .
do they only have _num_ technician ?
my suggestion is get estimates and use another company .
it is now june and it has not been picked up !
!
worst customer service ever !
she was also beginning to have difficulty feeling when she had to poop .
this last week we stopped for lunch and i ordered a burger .
very disappointing .
truly disappointed .
ridiculous .
terrible customer service !
she sent me a message this morning referring me to a baby proof company .
horrible mistake .
_num_ .
customer service - horrible .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
lazy front desk .
_num_ .
smoking and non-smoking rooms are on the same floor .
you can hear noise from _num_ rooms down if you step out your door .
do n't stay here .
this place is awful .
they are also hard to track down .
ugh .
i was traveling alone for business and arrived late at night .
terrible .
would never return if i did not have to .
but still , ugh !
do not stay at this location .
i could have stayed in sheraton at the price we paid to stay here .
i asked for some shampoo , and she gave it to me .
confused ... .
whataburger disappointment !
miss , what are you looking at ? ''
there was so much grease .
i regret not going to in-n-out burger .
nasty !
by the time it came out correctly everyone else was done eating .
this place is horrible .
it was ridiculous .
the wait staff is friendly and there is plenty of seating .
apparently we were wrong .
avoid at all costs .
stupid me .
i waited _num_ minutes .
can i get this beer removed ?
)
not good times .
for a two day business trip , i stayed at the hilton garden inn .
the bulk of my complaints concern the bathroom .
did n't sleep at all .
disappointed for a hilton .
air is loud and noisy as well .
just disappointed ... .
the hotel staff in my hotel even told me their burgers were great .
fire alarm at _num_ am .
workout facility is mediocre .
terrible .
very noisy .
first room was noisy .
my husband and i just ate there .
the only vegetarian option was a grilled cheese sandwich .
every load they delivered was crushed or in pieces .
( thus , the reason i hired movers to begin with . )
he went over in detail with them what was going etc .
terrible !
oh and guess when my stuff comes back to california ?
the absolute last day of the _num_ week window .
this place is terrible !
they only exchanged it for another one .
too pricey for south phoenix .
my advice : drive _num_ yards farther west on baseline and play legacy .
at that point he was offered several tee times by courtney .
i asked for tee times on the thursday morning and was offered several .
no more !
because this was not good pizza .
greasy , sure .
quite simply , you get what you pay for .
poor horrible quality !
the place felt hot and there were flies everywhere .
she insisted it worked .
this place sucks .
i actually did a lot of research before picking this place .
the food was horrible .
the nursing staff i saw the friday i visited were less than professional .
this place is terrible !
i would not recommend this place .
if you do , you will regret it .
absolutely horrible service .
tonight was our first time eating here .
i ordered the taco chicken salad and it looked incredible !
very disappointed .
all the kid ( workers ) are playing around behind the counter .
order was wrong .
i will not be returning .
the worst !
a few weeks later i went and again stood in line for a lifetime .
that fish could kill me !
cashier : `` i could get fired for giving you my personal information .
i just ca n't steal points from safeway .
but agree the staff is terrified to actually help you .
wait times in line are ridiculously long .
hire more cashiers on days you know it will be busy !
this store sucks .
i 'm weary of this place.
breakfast was bacon , eggs , pancake .
he make me a crown that i do n't need it !
screwed my teeth !
my experience at baseline dental care was a mixed bag .
the way this was handled upset me .
i had never met him before .
it was right before christmas and i was in pain .
one dentist assistant who was pleasant and gentle with me was michelle .
i went to baseline dental for cleaning and the annual x-rays .
the last time i went there was in summer of _num_ .
how else could he afford to drive nice vehicles ?
terrible !
ordered pepperoni pizza and wings ( $ _num_ ) .
i agree with the other posters on one thing though .
while waiting , i saw them opening giant cans of pre-made pizza sauce .
this place is horrible !
they were not edible .
for the record , these comments came from about _num_ of our party guests .
slow service .
i was bumped _num_ times today .
there is some seating , but not much .
and then i stopped coming with my mom .
just eh .
worst customer service ever !
so not worth it !
not worth paying _num_ dollars for .
lame .
i ate here last spring and ordered the chicken fajitas .
my dad ordered the steak fajitas ... again with the soy sauce .
i would not eat here again .
but this was horrible .
i 've been a patron of this establishment since i was a young child .
the chicken was flavorless .
Negative
wish yelp allowed negative stars .
poor nice bartender .
`` i could get something just like this at del taco . ''
it was then drowned in a white cream cheese jalapeo sauce .
all very salty to me .
i was was so excited to have lunch there .
not impressed .
we ordered a chimichanga with red chili and a smothered chicken burrito .
worst service ever !
there was a very distinct smell around our table in the room .
the menu provided some traditional mexican food items , which were fairly authentic .
my first time here and i left never wanting to come back again .
more customer service .
came here the other day and i honestly feel like this place is overrated .
went for lunch with _num_ of the girls .
she said it had more sour cream in it than avocado .
terrible customer service !
disgusting atmosphere .
go somewhere else .
never again .
worst customer service .
place has really gone down hill .
it use to be my favorite ... .
so tonight was a different experience than in the past .
tonight , we had our meal as usual .
the enchilada was better of the two in my opinion .
and the prices were soo cheap .
we felt we were being rushed out of the establishment .
i will not eat here ever again !
tried to call in order .
i order veggie fried rice , veggie egg rolls and fried chicken wings .
horrible food .
ripoff , unprofessional and rude staff !
this was not acceptable .
but i can find that in my back yard .
i get the feeling the customers are trying to hard too .
well this is the review i to farms comment site .
spent _num_ dollars .
guess the change in head chefs was a big deal after all .
it was gross .
no thanks .
to sit on the chairs .
not going back .
the small treats , like bars , muffins , etc .
are expensive as well .
surrounding area with picnic tables was nice though .
the sandwiches were fine , if heavy on the mayo .
ahh yes , the farm kitchen at the farm at south mountain .
i 'm never going back .
_num_ guests showed up .
it was very disappointing .
over $ _num_ .
this experience was anything but fun from the beginning .
to list your sides that you could choose from .
it was n't even half full !
long wait at the one outdoor restroom in a trailer .
when our bill arrived our entrees totaled $ _num_ .
it was completely ridiculously overpriced .
terrible mimosas .
service was terrible .
terrible .
they 're the worst .
very loud !
my _num_ year old granddaughter could have done a better job .
however , i 'm quite sure she was knowledgeable of her actions .
it was just meh .
worst service ever !
wo n't be back .
yet they still died .
the prices are out of sight .
not a soul in sight .
purchased $ _num_ pot _num_ weeks ago .
but thats really the only positives about this place .
i do not recommend this course .
they need much better signage .
so disappointed .
it looked ridiculous .
when you put everything together it tasted alright but it was just dry chicken .
i was greeted kindly as i walked in the door .
all were too salty .
cheap cushions unfortunately .
a `` level _num_ for the price of a level _num_ '' .
perhaps because the lunch special price is cheap at $ _num_ .
this makes leaving flowers and other items for your loved one near to impossible .
shame on you !
this is plain ridiculous .
another time i got _num_ regular burgers instead of the sandwich i had ordered .
)
last night me and my fiance visited for food after seeing a concert .
not over done but black .
i said whatever and figured i would call and address this in the morning .
apparently one is not there on the weekends .
nope .
not so much as a `` how do you do ? ''
i wrote an email to the _num_ teachers .
horrible experience .
luxury is only in the price .
do not rent here or even apply .
everyone there doesnt seem to have their ducks in a row .
waste of time .
so this is a _num_ star review kids .
all lights and tv were on .
avoid them !
it would n't start well when cold .
( actual repair cost around $ _num_ ) .
i went to the mcdowell location and dealt with the manager , barry .
needless to say , i have not been back to this location since .
horrible , horrible !
sun devil auto destroyed the engine on my truck !
i showed an associate a picture of ace brand grass seed in my phone .
teenagers are walking around in the middle of the night being loud .
so ... cheap apartment = ghetto and headaches .
it smells like weed constantly .
cheap apartments , and for good reason .
maintenance is questionable .
i had never seen him before and i was naked .
renew my lease .
so disgusting !
it was horrible !
other than that , nothing else will fit .
my neighbors had _num_ people living in a _num_ bedroom .
you wait , and wait for the work to get done .
the people they let move in most are alcoholic scum .
i showed the yelp offer , and they took the keys .
_num_ stars for customer service & a checkin offer .
_num_ for the latter .
so my advice is be careful .
be very careful with this place .
you have been warned .
go to great wok instead for great take out .
nothing to write home about .
hubby had szechuan chicken .
but wait , there 's more .
very poor customer service !
there was a sign from a bank and some plastic money on a table .
i really like the idea of this place .
`` you guys have any specials running tonight ? ''
so ... it 's not all domestic drafts .
the guy was friendly enough though .
fail .
the more i think about this meal , the more upset i get .
a little adult interaction might do him good !
visited this location for the first time tonight .
the chicken sandwich was excellent , very tasty .
it almost feels like they 're trying to cut corners .
she needs to go because she ca n't handle the pressure .
that is not customer service .
today , my mother and i went to native for dinner .
i was disappointed .
i will try this place again , i always give places another try .
we came on sunday , and the wings are crazy cheap .
we did not get enough wings .
it 's your money people , it 's your choice .
came here today for the _num_ cent wings with co-workers .
very slow .
not to mention the diet coke which she finally brought as a doctor pepper .
it 's hard for them to cook your food the way you want it .
sarah was rude .
_num_ of us in our group are in the industry .
i will not be back .
food came late , drinks were n't refilled in a timely manner .
everything was overcooked .
horrible service !
since then , our showers are still having problems .
you people are freaking crazy .
i see .
you can really hear upstairs neighbors walking .
i 'm so glad to be done with them because they suck !
once again anyone thinking about this place , run for the hills !
i would not recommend this property .
this management company does not deserve your hard earned money .
just do n't rent here .
i have shopped at this bashas for over _num_ years .
he comes back and tells me it 's a max of _num_ .
every time i have gone in there the power chairs have broke down .
it 's friday night and they have _num_ cashiers .
the lines are at least _num_ people deep each line .
the prices are n't cheaper .
the service is not fast .
in the last couple months i have had to return defective merchandise from amazon .
no thank you .
it was very frustrating .
i stopped on the way home tonight .
staff is loud , ever see `` king burger '' video ?
mcdonald 's has changed so much over the years it 's hard to recognized .
food was hot and all but the service was eh .
my request .
_num_ hours ... .

and do n't treat me that way !
and asked for my money back .

had to repeat our order _num_ times to employee .
it was ridiculous !
this dirty and slow !
the taco was literally soaked in greasy sauce .
_num_ .
for _num_ miles after the first change i 've had an oil leak .
Neutral
he just looked away and walked off .
thought to myself , ok , i 'm out of here then .
my car is still not ready .
why do they call it jiffy lube ?
terrible .
terrible .
terrible .
also they never lock my floor mats back down after vacuuming ?
_num_ for `` super '' wash and floor mats but forgot the floor mats .
the car wash was gets a cut from these guys .
i 've been here twice .
they seem to rush the car wash process .
i 'm _num_ but i do look like i 'm around _num_ .
absolutely ridiculous .
i will never be spending my money here again .
they are horrible .
now i 'm going to have to spend 30-40 min detailing the car .
got the # _num_ .
let crumbs in plain sight .
so sad .
very slow .
_num_ strikes your out !
hard to see the cheaper wash options .
are they permanently closed ?
i 'm not a fan .
tonight was my second visit to sakana .
more sushi than i could eat , for _num_ bucks .
tonight i stopped in for cali rolls , unagi , and edamame .
but in the end , the rest of the meal was just ... meh .
i 'm a sucker for spider rolls .
these guys want more eel , she wants it sweeter .
she also had some unagi nigiri .
this place is horrible !
cheap drinks and appetizers was all that was a positive .
i was so excited to try this place after reading the reviews .
not a good first experience .
every time i 've gone , the servers completely ignore us .
it was a little busy , but eventually completely died .
the service was a bit better .
it was awful .
it was very hard to keep down .
after the 2nd trip , i 've decided not to come back .
ridiculous .
what 's not to like .
probably the very same week .
the sushi chef was different though .
if you 'd rather not play the game , go to sushi ken .
i 've eaten at about _num_ sushi joints around here .
i am giving _num_ stars just because it was really cheap .
and this place plays _num_ 's pop music loudly .
our tofu tempura appetizer came out after the entrees .
did n't add to the experience .
wo n't go again .
that 's just me being critical though .
entrees were mostly tempura too .
my boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki .
the udon was nearly gone .
i ate most of those before my rainbow roll came out .
i had also heard complaints from my group on how dim the lighting was .
extremely poor service .
i regret that decision .
avoid !
until a year ago , i 'd have given this place ten stars !
this is not an exaggeration .
rude and unprofessional .
recently the quality has suffered .
not a fan .
bar is mediocre .
service could be loads better .
not impressed .
wo n't come back .
i was so disgusted .
such a bummer because i 've always heard such good things .
we were so disappointed .
they gave us a coupon to try them again at a later time .
Negative
i am so disappointed !
never going back .
when we got the spicy tuna roll , it was pale .
beware is all i have left to say .

it was n't crunchy .
they only get _num_ stars for the excellent service .
disappointing !
seaweed salad too chewy to eat .
wo n't be returning .
party of _num_ .
the rib-eye was extremely fatty , essentially like gum .
Negative
id rather have a mcdonald 's burger than wait for that plate .

in the place where pool tables once were , are now teppanyaki grills .
unfortunately , everything was bad .
was it sitting in the kitchen long time ?
rice seemed to be old .
an employee greeted me and i said , `` just one , please '' .
checkout lines almost always long , staff rarely available to help .
not super clean .
ryan kept rolling his eyes and was very short with me .
really needed to go and it 's as though it never existed !
walked in and got the crazy eye from the old lady .
why on earth would anyone come to this location ?
from the salad bar that needed maintenance to the restrooms .
bathrooms need more regular maintenance as do all of the games .
service is bad .
i have been here on _num_ occasions .
the worst experience ever .
never was this told to us at the time of purchase .
peter piper pizza was a way better choice for dinner last night .
even saved me about $ _num_ .
staff was not friendly or attentive .
of course what does she bring me , a chicken quesadilla .
not a crappy quesadilla .
i would suggest finding a better option .
not everyone has time to wait around while you take your sweet time !
i have gone to denny 's later and had more cheery people around me .
anyway , so my bro and i get this one young waiter .
first of all it seems to have gotten less appetizing all around .
this was the resort that was chosen after a night out .
_num_ % disappointment .
nonetheless , all cold .
like it was such an inconvenience to her to place such a complex order .
in the beginning , everything was great and servers joked around .
today however the experience was much less than expected .
my vegetable omelette was almost half its usual serving .
Neutral
this restaurant was horrible !
we showed up at _num_ o'clock tonight and ask for a table .
the problem is service !
the breakfast experience started with two coffees and two waters .
i will not be back .
do n't spend your tip all in one place !
the booth was n't even clean .
this place is disgusting .
so _num_ month and yet again visited not on a busy night .
no sir no its not .
the good part of that meal were the kettle chips , really !
trying to be upscale but it really doesnt get there .
the pale ale was better .
dead wrong .
no real surprise there .
the food started off pretty well .
also , their kettle chips are only okay .
horrible service .
avoid .
: ( white ale , red ale , dark ale ?
oh well , just will quit going .
everything is pricey too for being so-so food .
salads are $ _num_ and up .
walking back i noticed the floors were covered in crumbs and food .
my friends had ordered a bagel with spread that looked better .
it was about $ _num_ with tax and i left still hungry .
i 've only ever tried breakfast bagel sandwiches .
customer service could be way better .
very disappointing !
bagels were just ok .
what a ripoff .
it was very disappointing .
the service is terrible .
if they do that well , then they forget something else .
the bagels are always cold .
food is mediocre .
i was craving dairy queen for quite awhile .
so ridiculous .
will not be back here .
the service at this store is deplorable , and here 's why .
you will get screwed !
fuck you big o assholes .
no customer service here .
he was rude .
he did n't even tell me .
in other words , you get a lot less coffee for the money .
looks like i 'm going back to starbucks !
first off i paid my rent , a day late .
then someone broke in and stole my stuff .
= $ _num_ .
ugh , what a waste .
poor decision .
last night , my pollo asada had a piece of metal in it .
but no !
but still nothing .
it started off good when it first opened about _num_ years ago .
the rice and beans where hot on the outside and cold in the middle .
not really .
they were each sized like pieces you 'd cut off a steak .
ultimately it was removed from our bill .
_num_ .
_num_ .
bland .
the beans were terrible .
stopped in for dinner tonight and was greeted promptly and seated very quickly .
the lettuce and dressing were pretty good though .
she too said there were some changes to the menu and recipes .
and i think the cheesy dcor is pretty cool , too .
the tortillas are not authentic mexican at all .
for starters , the chips .
boring .
a+ they are flavorful but portion size is down .
you have not had great red enchilada sauce until you 've had this one .
no rice .
another disappointment .
i think an egg batter a la chile relleno would be an improvement here .
the old macayo 's was much better .
service was so slow !
kinda mushy ... stuff .
unbelievable .
just had dinner at this location with my boyfriend .
worst waiter ever !
in sum , it was a real shit show .
the food - acceptable .
the service - inept from start to finish .
service was very bad .
my wife and i went there last for `` beef taquitos '' .
well , they are not available on the new menu .
no more !
so disappointing .
i have not been in forever .
i see why the group does not come here anymore .
service is awful and slow .
worst place ever !
we will not go back .
the fried batter was just about all there was .
panda garden - not good !
the portions are very small , even the rice is a very small scoop .
= not going back !
tip : hot wok mr. cook on warner rd .
these dishes lack flavor .
terrible staff , rude .
never had a problem with staff or food .
maybe more help needs to be hired .
never no apology .
plus service sucked !
very very disgusting !
it was very bland .
for chicken , it was okay .
it remained me of orange chicken from panda express with some spice .
i will probably not coming back .
food ... not spectacular .
not my favorite .
yes you can have too much lemongrass .
thankfully the music became the highlight of the evening .
my wine cellar is the first stop .
for a minute there i was getting thirsty .
we ordered some roasted brussel sprouts , classic pizza , fries , and hummus .
3rd try - stopped in for a glass of wine in the early evening .
are you kidding me ?
we will not return here .
we got _num_ oz of white wine and one shrimp wrapped in prosciutto .
there are other wine bars that do this better such as the living room .
horrible service .
the manager , samantha , really needs a lesson in customer service .
completely rude !
they were really understaffed .
was n't pleased .
the place was n't really busy .
this place can not handle big crowds and the waitresses never write anything down .
the wine selection is laughable for a place with wine in the name .
pathetic .
i am so thrilled to be away from there .
_num_ .
paying the high rent that we do , we should feel secure .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
but tonight was it .
talked to the staff and not much there .
but that is not the case .
this has been going on for months and never has a car been towed .
maybe the basketball court should close at a decent time so kids can sleep .
file gets transferred to another leasing agent who is to take over the file .
_num_ .
not to mention anyone can come and go as they please .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
customer service is a joke .
_num_ .

ridiculous fees all around .
it made getting things accomplished very difficult .
the restaurant to me looks like it 's been written off .
tables were not clean .
we just went to the _num_ e ray rd location in phoenix az .
fatty gross meat .
but now its really in decline .
high prices , and lower quality .
)
not family friendly at all .
we could not even finish it off .
why are we paying that much again ?
the food , however , was delicious .
skip ahead a week .
worst !
disappointed .
seems like the melting pot should read some of these reviews to make improvements .
this was our very first visit and it may be our last .
and it 's very expensive for only a so-so dining experience .
i 'd rather spend $ _num_ at a better restaurant .
please comment and follow me for more reviews !
boy was i wrong .
- the meat is overly seasoned ; coated head to toe with salt .
this will not happen again .
ok , whatever .
he just walked away .
seriously , get over yourself .
it was extremely rude .
our server was extremely personable and courteous the entire evening .
so , we spent all last night in and out of the bathroom .
he later returned with _num_ shrimp and about _num_ bite size portions of beef .
we sure did n't feel welcome .
for such a high-end restaurant , they sure do n't treat you that way .
not at this place !
first off my husband and i went to dinner here on a thursday night .
are you kidding me ?
_num_ hours !
that being said , this restaurant was a very big disappoint to us .
it was dark and dated in appearance .
wo n't be back .
the table situation was another big miss .
i was very disappointed .
_num_ ) the restaurant it self needs to be updated .
the ambiance and dcor was similar to that of a black angus .
just not very classy .
tables were pretty small too .
the white chocolate portion was delicious .
for about $ _num_ a person i expected so much more .
never poured our wine for us .
it was very pricey though .
too expensive .
the food was fine , atmosphere normal , drinks were drinks .
well , the new breakfast menu is nothing like that .
puff pastry , eggs , and marinara for breakfast ?
no thank you .
extremely disappointed .
last night , i ordered the catfish on special .
still no refill .
i flagged our waiter down , and asked for a refill again .
overall experience felt cheap , when the bill was quite pricey .
i would not recommend .
this was a restaurant we ate at very frequently .
the worst waitress ever .
worst service ever .
i can not over state this .
my wife ordered the other special , chicken tortilla soup and a turkey melt .
i sent my patty melt back to be cooked this time .
jewelry .
shoes .
i saw some purses that were a little better but they were over-priced .
why are there two separate lines if that is the way it works ?
now it is awful !
ugh .
the thing that stunned me was the hostess .
my wife and i went for lunch to celebrate our anniversary .
service very slow .
he just dropped it off and went away .
manager brought out more eggs as we were paying the bill .
they adjusted the check though , so that was nice .
just disgusting .
this was my first time visiting mimi 's in ahwatukee for mother 's day .
the food was mediocre .
my kids that ordered burgers had a plate full but i had _num_ .
the only bright spot was our waiter who was very attentive .
avoid .
slow service !
im not the biggest fan of this store .
milk to be expressed .
that i would wait anywhere between 1-2 hours .
anyways ?

well , you are .
the service is atrocious .
they sliced the other bagel in the bag , though .
seems like the management and service needs to get it together .
seriously ?
annoying .
people around me were blown away by the `` mean girl '' performance !
two stars because the margaritas were tasty .
the food was horrible .
they were not very good .
ate here several times and the only decent food is the rice .
the redeeming factor of this restaurant is its patio .
kudos for the hostesses who were very apologetic .
the waitress was a bit of a pain .
this restaurant is off my list for good .
the service is terrible .
i 'd give this _num_ star in terms of food .
the service , chips and salsa were fine then it all went south .
it was pretty awful .
Negative
horrible service .
also ordered a side of sour cream .
will not be back .
horrible visit .
but they obviously do n't train their bartenders correctly .
ordered a _num_ sauce chicken burrito without onions and peppers .
no manage apology .
not real busy .
there might be a problem .
what a shame !
i ordered a chicken taco ( crispy ) and a spinach and mushroom enchilada .
they added their corn in the enchilada .
my _num_ tacos could have made up _num_ whole taco .
i ordered a chicken taco ( crispy ) and a spinach and mushroom enchilada .
they added their corn in the enchilada .
the burritos here look like taquitos , small and skinny , with open ends .
it was just a tortilla stuffed with veggies .
i will never visit this place .
different locations of course .
never will go back .
waitress was prompt in getting our drinks and taking our order .
she made a comment that she had put the order in .
i could have paid half as much for a better meal at rubio 's .
the food is disgusting .
the tamales sucked !
extremely mediocre mexican food .
service always slow .
been to _num_ different locations .
chips were n't fully fried .
but whatever .
on my last trip to this location i had a fairly typical experience .
service at this location seems to be a frequent issue .
uh , ok.
looks like a macaroni grill is not a macaroni grill .
finally , we went on a saturday for dinner and it was insanely crowded .
only one small problem .
you could get a lot nicer salad at a sit-down restaurant for less money .
that 's ridiculous .
not worth the money .
i was excited they had gluten-free options but hoped for more than _num_ soup .
every time we have ever been here , they have had clam chowder .
this place is not clean .
only location i like in the east valley is the one in gilbert .
however nothing ever looks appetizing .
sadly , not true .
i recently went to joe 's for a haircut .
i wear my hair long .
Positive
that to me is really shady .
given my prior experience , however , i tend to doubt it .
the gold would probably turn out to be just plated .
are you kidding me ?
not coming here again .
we chose to get a manicure as well and i immediately regretted it .
however my last visit has officially sealed the deal .
doing .
terrible customer service store !
i would not recommend !
wtf !
i really ca n't say anything , to be honest .
nothing to write home about .
prices were nice and cheap .
nothing special .
drove _num_ miles to check it out because of the tv show .
was n't worth it .
this place was featured on diners and dives , so we had high expectations .
we had _num_ types of tacos and a shrimp burrito .
the lengua was alright but the pieces were too big .
the shrimp burrito had very few small shrimp in it .
the cash and messed my order up .
i arrived at the restaurant estimated ready time stated during our phone order .
the beans are all cold .
whether , chinese , mexican , greek .
prices were quite reasonable .
just plain gross .
well , i 'm gon na be honest .
the food is bad .
sauces taste nasty .
meat is not the freshest .
the prices are ridiculous .
would not recommend .
i took it up and showed the cashier girl .
try burrito company instead .
so it was half full ... .
terrible service !
the 1/2 dozen other customers were all waiting same time .
this place feels like a fast food place to me , not a restaurant .
$ _num_ bucks is too much for fast food imo .
i was wrong .
taco bell has better bean and cheese burritos .
disgusting .
however , thumbs up for customer service .
however , thumbs up for customer service .
i ca n't imagine coming back .
do n't go on taco tuesday .
is not worth it .
this was my 1st time trying this place out .
salsas are less than o.k .
need i say , i called to order for pick up .
.
but service was bad .
it was my first time here & i was ordering for my office .
this place sucks .
broke ass mexican food at hipster prices .
basically , f this place .
_num_ stars for service , but food tasted good , so _num_ stars .
_num_ orders past our number , i inquired if our food was ready .
they switched their menudo so that it 's only available on the weekends .
they also had stopped serving breakfast for some reason .
thanks a lot .
and the staff is somewhat inept , if friendly .
i just relocated from los angeles _num_ weeks ago .
first impressions mean everything .
i came here because of a groupon or a living social deal .
i dropped off my dog first thing in the morning when they opened .
i boarded him for _num_ days .
i 'm gon na have to pass on this place based on my experience .
questionable !
i ordered the italian beef sandwich , she an artichoke chicken pita sandwich .
had two pieces of tomato very few onions and some tzatziki sauce .
the chicken was dry & tasted weird .
for example i had the greek salad with grilled chicken .
we ordered a gyro and a chicago hot dog .
both were horrible .
the hot dog was also small and not really made like a chicago dog .
this place is horrible .
wrong .
when i had them transferred to my new dentist ( dr .
really - how exactly does one use a pool vacuum too much ?
i talked to the service manager and even the owner .
it was very posh .
i just wish they had used the money for that to hire better stylists .
i placed a small down payment to reserve my item .
the salesman was extremely helpful and offered us all of these great deals .
that salesman we liked has a difficult time returning phone calls now too .
i 'm planning on contacting the attorney general and bbb .
i 'm about ready to return it .
seriously what is it with furniture salesmen , they 're just like car salesmen !
is n't that classy ?
nothing like having company over .
_num_ weeks later , still nothing .
dont buy from them as obviously they are down to only a few stores .
zero stars .
we will not be back .
so glad this place is going under .
nothing but cheap plastic and vinyl junk !
they do n't even deserve _num_ star .
pedicure lasted _num_ week .
ample enough time to do a mani/pedi .

i dread going into this bank .
this place is awful .
Very negative
it was freezing cold .
they make it extremely difficult to be a patient of theirs !
this has been going on for a year and a half .
i 'm a really low maintenance client .
i couldnt believe my ears .
all of it lost .
talk about a disaster .
yuck , really ?
purchased a computer - spent extra money to have dropped shipped in two days .
terrible customer service !
you guessed it : same ear buds for $ _num_ less !
ah , well .
i stopped by this location closest to me to pick up a microwave .
we used our reward points to get $ _num_ off .
the laptop was a bit slower than in the store .
either way , not cool .
i suggest going to the chandler mall location .
found it , it does not .
i then visited your store at approximately 11am on wednesday , march 30th .
place looked average clean .
ca n't remember the last time i had a manicure .
i will not be going back .
nails are filled horribly .
Negative
they refused .
the guy was arrogant .
oh , and i 'm still peeling product off my skin .
simply disgusted .
i should 've walked then !
kids screaming , ruining up and down the hallways .
do not stay here .
ridiculous .
i was very angry .
i am never staying here again .
she gave me attitude whenever i requested fresh linen .
who cares that i am freezing cold i guess .
it was actually very hard to sleep .
it was horrible .
checked in late in the evening and housekeeping had plenty of time to clean .
terrible management .
reservations apparently mean nothing here .
avoid .
if i could give it less than i would .
woke up to a roach watching me nap .
my have they changed .
no eye contact no hello .
totally disgusted !
i purchased a few items and went to checkout .
worst service here !
just come here for dropping off packages !
the manager does not know anything about computers .
she needs to take a beginner course in computer _num_ .
this is not the first time .
i told her , i know .
i am so stupid .
the doctor is trying to just find work to do and charge the insurance .
they are still calling me to schedule an appointments for my teeth fillings .
ever since they worked on my teeth i 've been in pain .
i thought the whole point of taco bell is its open late .
i guess this is the deal for you .
no pepperoni ?
as i remember one of my colleague told me a must play course .
well this just confirmed by belief .
i scheduled an oil change over a week ago .
really poor customer service .
i 'm not coming back .
had a hot sub , was heated up in a microwave .
_num_ , maybe _num_ seconds ?
sanitation on that situation = _num_ .
my chips taste terrible .
not crunchy at all .
not so clean , both the facility and the workers .
excuse me ?
whenever we 've gone there , there 's rarely anyone to help you .
the lady at the cutting table always seems overwhelmed , too .
i 've taken several sewing classes and buy fabric here all the time .
slow slow slow !
ridiculous !
rude and dismissive .
are you kidding me ?
i left without buying anything .
i just needed to buy one thing for my halloween costume .
avoid if you can !
not impressed .
needless to say i was very dissatisfied .
ive gone here about eight times over a year .
not a tour !

terrible haircut .
it is typically bands just starting out , not established valley bands .
this is a decent place to grab a beer and watch a ball game .
a cover charge ?
the guinness was properly poured but not served in a traditional pint glass .
hard to taste the beef through all the seasoning though .
jack 's is probably a good neighborhood drinking hole .
do n't expect anything more than cold beer and casual atmosphere .
if washed up covers are your thing , this is your place .
they do n't care .
i was afraid she might attack , which has never been a concern .
never again will i go this vet .
only down side is they are very very expensive compared to other vets .
but i suppose the old folks that come here are n't exactly picky .
sadly , no .
skip that bread too .
it 's soggy and stale .
good location , average food , but too expensive .
drink service is slow .
good location , average food , but too expensive .

this place is too pricey for the quality and size of their food .
_num_ different prices for the same brand of beer .
if you really have a choice , go to garage across the street .
mozzarella cheese sticks average to good .
pasta bland sauce also .
the place was packed though our table was ready as per our reservation .
this is an italian restaurant , where 's the ambiance ?
oh ... but it gets better .
gross !
we just should have walked out and said `` really ? ''
$ _num_ for what ?
no presentation at all ?
_num_ .
call them baked oysters , or something , but not rockefeller , c'mon .
Negative
the service was bad .
for the prices they charge i expect more .
i ordered the linguini pasta with clams in a garlic sauce .
after being there awhile we finally we had somebody get our drinks .
the customer service sucked .
i have n't been to a wendy 's in a very long time .
ugh .
only the drinks were correct .
not to mention their prices are now comparable to better quality fast food places .
nello 's you really let me down .
this was the first and probably last visit to nellos .
may come back may not .
i 've tried two pizzas here : the bbq chicken and the vegetarian .
i walked out , plain and simple .
stopped in after a hard day , and got a pizza to go .
as i recall , it was much better .
no kidding !
totally flavorless .
i have been going to boston market for years .
so tonight i returned .
over the years i have been there dozens of times .
horribly slow service !
when i arrived the line had only one person that was being helped .
bad business !
now i remember why we stopped coming .
secondly , their crust is the wonder bread equivalent of pizza dough .
gave ra two chances .
was terrible .
total waste of money .
the low prices are n't enough to get me to return , however .
i 've been to ra a few times in arizona and california .
the loud rock music and night club atmosphere was a little too much .
a little disappointed .
bad idea .
for dessert , we ordered the banana maki .
do n't eat there .
prices are a little steep considering they serve 2nd rate sushi .
- but our waitress was awesome .
it 's hard to screw up miso soup , edamame and veggie rolls .
it 's chain , keep your expectations low .
we were seated and ordered our drinks and all was well .
its just not happening .
a pricy place to grab a bite .
the noise volume absolutely smothered the meal and destroyed the atmosphere for me .
cheap sake , cheap beers , cheap sushi .
the sushi is made in the same process as going to a subway .
would i recommend the sushi ?
but i would recommend the sushi if you want cheap eats .
the service was horrible .
it was just annoying .
the service could be so much better .
disappointing !
mediocre food and poor service .
whenever i see little kids eating here , i question their parents ' decisions .
gross .
the service was not good .

awful , horrible , terrible service .
corporate recently decided to stop their happy hour on saturdays .
in once instance , it was a _num_ cent discount .
the seaweed salad was pretty tasty but the rest was just average .
downhill !
totally ignored us .
i am always weary of eating sushi far from the coast .
everything else i mentioned was safe for me to eat .
i feel like they could have offered more discount or deals .
immediately i felt like i had just sliced my lip open .
tonight was the first time i came to this restaurant .
all i tasted was squeezed lime .
for the money we spent there i expected better service .
her response ?
it was n't very busy .
the service was n't very good .
tonight , we called ahead for party of _num_ .
overly pepper short ribs .
great atmosphere but the sushi fell short especially con the prices .
horrible experience .
ive been craving udon and ramen probably for the last month or so .
there were few vegetables in this curry , and the beef was exceptionally tough .
try great wok instead .
poor .
bland .
probably not .
my old favorite was kung pao chicken , so i ordered it .
besides , i sometimes do eat orange chicken , so i let it pass .
not going to eat there anymore .
bad , bad , bad .
it was brown gravy like consistency with beef in it but almost nothing else .
all this for _num_ dollars .
i walked out disgusted .
_num_ cashier was friendly .
food is n't anything special !
really expected better food after seeing _num_ stars .
rip off .
do not bother !
only vegetables at the bottom of a large bowl of practically cold broth .
not worth your money or your time .
unfortunately this place is painfully slow .
ordered _num_ separate dishes .
the pad thai and the ginger shrimp broccoli .
the pad thai was decent , not the best i 've had .
i did n't finish it obviously .
i feel like this is a americanized thai food place .
i 'm so mixed on this place .
the lemon chicken , curry , and cashew chicken are all delicious .
ordered an order of egg rolls , crispy beef and chicken pad thai .
gross !
absolutely unacceptable and disgusting .
it was clean and the staff were really courteous .
i would order again .
really turned me off .
they were very courteous and apologetic .
the next day i noticed oil on my driveway .
terribly incompetent .
not to mention that my car was returned with the check engine light on .
no , i replied .
it 's this brake masters that is n't fine .
see why i 'm suspicious of the loose bolt issue .
so i mentioned this yelp review .
waste of money .
staff seems friendly but nothing stands out .
never going back .
she was extremely rude !
me being there was such an inconvenience to her .
this location is very skimpy on the food .
was just not good today .
just unfriendly and crowded .
to be fair , it 's been years and maybe it 's changed .
so lame .
just avoid this place .
not to mention that their facilities are in decline .
consider yourselves warned !
i 'm sure the attorney general would be interested in hearing about it .
they really need to spend some money on new equipment .
this does n't exist anymore .
i asked for a full set with gel polish .
i was so annoyed .
if i could give them a _num_ i would .
the water my feet soaked in for _num_ prior min .
it was so large i completely forget i showed up near close .
just for convenience can be very expensive !
the carpet is this yucky commercial low pile stuff .
there is a continental breakfast but i was only tried the packaged yogurt .
we booked _num_ rooms , _num_ being handicap accessible .

the ticket prices are okay ; i can live with that .
hell yes i do !
only the system does n't recognize the word `` one '' .
it never arrived .
big fat thumbs down !
what a garbage company .
i will find other ways to secure ticket next time .
pure garbage .
no directions , no nothing .
maybe i just expect too much anymore ?
my family of four stayed here one saturday night on august _num_ .
seems like that should be standard on a resort of this caliber .
come on , they 've been around for what , _num_ years now ?
they should change the name of their water park from oasis to shit creek .
disgusting .
i did not like the rooms .
there was a baby sink and mirror area .
the beds were mediocre .
and i ca n't stop laughing .
would not stay here again .
i booked a suite for a conference .
and told me that it was more expensive than the king suite .
_num_ '' tube tvs in the room ?
only stayed here because the conference was here .
_num_ .

will not be coming back .

this place could be so much better .
the water park is the highlight of this resort .
staff was friendly with everyone i encountered .
terrible !
everybody i talked to shared my feelings on this resort .
find another resort !
_num_ or _num_ perhaps ?
never - never a _num_ .
the fridge did n't get cold .
the water park was nice though , but the onsite restaurants blew .
terrible food , terrible service .
i 'm sure there are nicer and cheaper hotels for that .
the hotel itself is large and spread out .
a night away from the _num_ kids ( our dogs ) !
is n't that like training _num_ ?
my fiance gives me better massages and they are free .
this is a hard review to write .
both nights !
so it 's a wash for me .
i was smoking mad about the lobby store closing before the posted time .
the cost of keeping an employee in there is $ _num_ an hour .
basically , _num_ customer an hour will break it even .
the rooms are really dated .
ok , starting at the beginning .
- the room was hot .
worst hotel experience ever .
horrible hotel !
the room was expensive , especially considering the summer rates .
for $ _num_ a drink i felt taken advantage .
we have stayed here before and had a better experience .
stayed here this past week on business travel .
just awful .
dirty , stained rooms .
they were completely bad .
please do n't stay here .
i hate this place .
the room was musty and the food was so-so .
very disappointed .
would not recommend this resort .
service is awful .
what a disappointment .
our room was the same room we were originally booked into .
not so .
my wife and daughter would remain in the car .
it looks like a rear entrance .
no sign ?
saturday night we called the front desk to get a late checkout .
that 's criminal .
but the rooms / cleanliness / etc .
is not up to par .
the staff needs an upgrade .
hotel rooms not so good .
it feels like i 've traveled back in time _num_ years .
he was extremely rude .
waters empty .
for _num_ hours , rarely checked in on us .
i give the resort _num_ stars only for the people who work there .
the website made it appear much more grand than it really is .
it was very small and all the fixtures felt cheap .
two of them were either a long walk away or a golf cart ride .
the wave pool was a joke .
anytime you need anything like a towel or shampoo they expect you to tip .
the staff is incompetent .
very poor customer service .
no compensation took place .
we were here to celebrate our first anniversary .
prices are of a nicer resort but do n't let it fool you .
we will never spend time or money here again .
disappointed !
the grounds are what make it a resort , not the experience .
he even kicked the ball on the green while we were putting .
do n't even want to give one star .
the wait to check in was ridiculously long , on a saturday afternoon .
needless to say , that didnt happen .
will not be back !
$ _num_ resort fee per night .
also up to _num_ people can stay in this room -- one towel hook ?
room keys that take up to _num_ attempts to work .
property seems extremely understaffed for this price point .
signage is also lacking .
wo n't be back unfortunately .
do n't let the photos fool you !
not a relaxing way to spend spring break .
easter brunch overpriced .
for the dough , go to disney .
now for the bad .
hell to the no .
so they gave me a complimentary mani .
kinda nice gave us a chance to chit chat .
$ _num_ dollar pedi .
this is a resort , you pay more for the experience .
that is so stupid .
run from this money pit !
the price was more then our cabana in hawaii .
tacky !
shower .
service at poolside bad .
after _num_ mins on hold we gave up .
for the price we are paying , mexico will be next trip .
for two nights with the stay and play package it was around $ _num_ .
we checked in at 4:30 and left at 7:30 .
the taxes are way higher than other hotels in the area .
only one tv of the two worked .
we were handed a map with brief explanation how to find our room .
love the place but the hidden _num_ $ resort fee kills the experience .
very unhappy customer !
the grounds and getting around was very confusing .
room very loud with freeway noise .
halfway through my week stay .
hot dog , $ _num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .

i am assuming this hotel is old because of the odd layout .
i give it a _num_ stars for the room that i stayed in .
they really should close at _num_ pm like the other hotels .
overall : disappointed .
a burger with run you north of $ _num_ !
pina colada $ _num_ !
stayed _num_ night in a villa for work on a corporate rate .
the grounds were nice and so was the water park .
not a fan of ranch ?
it was n't dry .
the veggies were piping hot and the baked beans were tasty .
the side salad and biscuit were decent .
the steak was not good .
the only draw here is the view of the city lights .
the food was `` eh '' , but not great .
bland , slow , no personality .

i 've had a better meal at texas roadhouse !
food sucked .
our meal was atrocious !
i was visiting from out of town and was brought here by some locals .
ok ... you 're either gon na love it or leave it .
the appetizer was nothing fancy .
$ _num_ dollar for dinner for _num_ without alcohol .
meh meh meh ... .
not much more to say .
poor service .
there are better places to spend your money .
rip off !
the servers are good people , the atmosphere is typical for a steak place .
not really mountains to me ) .
it is as if they squeezed the juices out of it .
i 've had soo much better before .
the meal was not fresh .
the ribs were also dry .
both of the kabobs were much better than the rest of the meal .
it was horrible !
overall terrible experience .
i could receive better customer service from a drive thru window .
i could receive better customer service from a drive thru window .
as first timers he explained the menu and asked f there were any questions .
bread and butter arrived quickly .
the meal came with green beans and corn on the cob .
there were two orders for baked potatoes .
not appetizing !
this place is awful .
the waitress looked at , made eye contact with me , then kept walking .
salad wilted and tired .
wine list poor .
the parking lot was full which made us regret choosing this place to eat .
she says `` you only get one . ''
neither were finished .
it was like he grabbed the cup from the back of a dense closet .
he was pretty clueless .
ugh .
by now over an hour has passed , it is after 8pm .
left hungry & not happy .
both steaks were overcooked !
we chose a low top by the window because of our child .
so we get our drinks and take them to the table .
skip ahead to ordering .
all dinners are served with green beans and a tiny corn on the cob .
both were gross !
both were overcooked .
but ... only have ranch dressing or oil and vinegar .
we tried the rattlesnake with prickly pear cactus fries .
went in on a whim last night , cool atmosphere .
we could n't even eat it .
gross !
waste of money .
hurts to have money taken out of my pocket on christmas .
steaks were mediocre .
skip the rattlesnake tho .
cactus fries were pretty good .
terrible .
nope , just as bad .
the band is too loud .
the ambiance and view is a _num_ .
the service is a _num_ .
i have no words .
_num_ for atmosphere and _num_ for food .
was i wrong !
service was terrible .
avoid !
the attitude of the staff was unlike anything i have experienced in this area .
to call this a steakhouse is laughable .
dont waste your money .
what a huge disappointment .
the food was terrible !
zero stars .
others at the table ordered fried chicken , white meat , for $ _num_ .
worst service !
totally not apologetic .
the best part about the dinner was probably the indian fry bread .
everything else was edible .
very mediocre .
on the plus side , my steak was cooked perfectly ( med .
the real downside to this is the pricing ... very expensive !
i even got my husband to go down the slide !
they brought out some salad and indian fry bread and biscuits while we waited .
shame !
the place is awesome .
terrible place .
also not good .
no crazy spices .
seriously , do not go here .
this should be a drinks only stop .
several tables around us made complaints and sent their food back .
i had join my _num_ adult children for dinner there friday night .
my husband and i chose this place after golfing one sunday .
would not even give one star .
views not that great anyways .
be careful of this place .
thanksgiving dinner disappointment !
worst service !
she deserves to be hired at a fine dinning restaurant .
so rude .
but really an hour and a half ?
highlight of the meal was the apple pie .
no seasoning at all .
bland rice .
an adorable bull is near the entrance and the view is awesome .
but i would say this place is more for kids than an adult night .
dry beef , low end salad .
i am hoping management reads this and makes a serious improvement .
... food quality for a _num_ hour meal would be appreciated .
this is the only review i have ever written .
false .
terrible food , terrible service .
what a mistake .
i arrived and the restaurant was extremely busy .
i think our wait was around the _num_ minute mark .
_num_ of us in our party ordered the nacho appetizer as our entree .
probably will not be back .
mr memory of this restaurant was much better than reality .
service is not good .
so disappointed !
we will not be back !
potatoes are ala carte .
Negative
i wish i had taken some pictures .
i will not be going back .

sadly disappointed .
not much else .
worst place ever !
place has _num_ stars and thats pushing it .
go here with out of town guests but not for a nice evening out .
the food was salty for some items & dry for others .
highly disappointed .
had better steak in the lunch room at high school .
almost booked a company dinner for _num_ here too !
also tried the rattlesnake as an appetizer .
really bad .
no second chance .
the waitstaff was not attentive .
overall , our dining experience was okay .
rustic theme would be ok , if i thought it was clean .
next time ordered wings and potato skins .
our dinner was $ _num_ .
i did n't try it .
they were extremely sour as well .
sides disgusting !
salad limp and lukewarm .
beans just awful .
just my _num_ cents .
such a disappointment .
we will not be back .
come here for the experience of it , not the food .
Neutral
worst experience ever !
it 's overpriced and low quality .
!
this place is considered a steakhouse ?
stupid kids running everywhere .
they have a home ranch that is awesome .
the taste and texture was similar to frog legs mixed with chicken .
it was fried which pretty much makes any protein taste the same .
the accompanying fried mushrooms were tasty .
shame on me .
do not wear a tie !
the carrots are overcooked .
it fell way way short .
bland flavor overall .
otherwise skip it .
it 's not for classy people .
there was no taste .
had the worst margarita .
waiting for _num_ pm !
no greeting .
literally in ten mins everything was out .
such a disappointment .
ok food served in a southern way , and the staff wear cowboy hats .
such s disappointment !
checked this place out after a relative suggested it .
extremely disappointing experience .
there were _num_ of us .
there are plenty of places close by to get much better steak .
steaks were cold , sides were cold .
horrible fat filled steak .
beans and fried mushrooms were good .
just presented us with the rest of the expensive bill .
so maybe the general manager should call us if they care .
painfully slow .
i 'm making sure everyone knows how i feel about this credit union .
terrible customer service .

this sweater only visited this store and was never washed by me .
but was not .
i did n't get one .
they actually complain about their hours and their management to the customers .
leave people alone when they eat !
you want italian herbs and cheese bread ?
too bad .
not here .
disgusting .
do n't fall for their _num_ % off coupon either !
also , i never complain or write reviews .
very disappointed once again .
management needs to overhaul this place !
very unsatisfied .
she also compared returning my food like returning a car someone just bought .
consistently disappointing .
but it was never anything special .
i was so uncomfortable !
horrible !
hard to say .
even the pickles , which i had been wanting for a while .
not so much ... ... .
first impression : this place smells like a locker room .
thank god i never paid anything to go there .
ridiculous !
_num_ dec _num_ actually a 1/2 of a star for business practices .
i am having problems getting on to the la fitness website .
bad business practice .
poor management .
i never interacted with the staff , only the front door person .
yet i can sign up in _num_ seconds on the website .

crappy service today .
_num_ stars because it does the job and has a variety of equipment .
the level of customer service is at an all time low .
there are no managers .
in regards to the facilities , the front desk people are hit and miss .
do yourself a favor and pay the extra money to get a lifetime membership .
service was weak .
only one server and he was overwhelmed .
eh ... but its cheap and you get what you pay for .
this has completely turned us away from wanting to eat here .
service was the worst .
my eggs were raw and strawberries on waffle old .
now its only the first time for this place but seriously .
will not be back .
went into get my brows waxed and was dissatisfied .
i 've gone in several times for gel manicures .
worst experience !
never going back .
not because she comped me .
also , my nails were never painted .
it was awful .
she was very aggressive with my eyebrow wax .
today though , i got there at _num_ and left around _num_ .
i went here for _num_ years before switching to public school .
it 's not great like everyone thinks !
on day three , i call to check in .
nearly two weeks later , i call them back .
ca n't open on time ?
it 's _num_ not the _num_ 's .
this place is horrible .
never going back .
never ever will i go here again .
bad service , bad pedicure .
bad business !
horrible horrible customer service .
i had a groupon and scheduled my appointment just fine .
do n't use that groupon !

would not recommend this location .
they 're always packed whenever i pickup a lunch takeout too .
food and service mediocre .
if u are someone who values customer service this isnt the place for you .
seriously , you ca n't afford to hire a couple of waiters ?
worst customer service ever !
very poor customer service .
the waiters were horrible .
chicken curry .
then i get home with second order and it 's way to spicy .
the pain was keeping me up at night .
i was excited to get to the bottom of it and resolve the issue .
i arrived at _num_ and was kept waiting until _num_ when he came in .
disappointed .
dr a came highly referred by a co-worker .
this was the only treatment is been receiving for my shoulder from dr a .
i will never return here .
ridiculous .
every single time i come to this location i completely regret it .
never again !
if they ca n't respond with some sort of empathy i am done .
horrible service and soggy burger .
then they were extremely short with their responses .
very disappointed .
slow service , mediocre food .
last visit was saturday december _num_ for dinner .
my vegetables were overlooked as was my steak .
my daughter 's steak was overlooked as well .
ah probably cuz it 's the only kfc here in ahwatukee .
no apology , no smile .
bad bad bad kfc !
rude service .
bad service mediocre food .
this location was the reason i stopped eating kfc .
never once did she offer to exchange my old product or apologized .
fucking disgusting .
it was fucking disgusting .
do not go to this place !
i returned to star of india last night for the third and final time .
our seconds experience we ordered for takeout and not as good .

you leave after sitting in a booth for one hour .
food was bland .
not spicy .
my wife and i have been going to this restaurant for about _num_ years .
disgusting .
give it a miss .
mediocre at best .
terrible .
such a disappointment .
Positive
the rice was cooked nicely as were the vegetarian portions of the assorted snacks .
such a ripoff !
a large cheese thin crust pizza is _num_ bucks .
do yourself a favor and check out sal 's pizza in tempe .
so this is my second time getting pizza from rosati 's delivered .
tonight , we got the thin crust .
it was the same experience .
she offered garlic bread instead .
alright , i guess .
the sauce has little garlic flies in it .
yes , it was a friday night , yes they claimed to be busy .
get it together , rosati 's .
she responded , `` it 's not too far from where i live .
just kidding , just kidding !
do n't trust me .
i wish i was back in chicago where i could get good pizza !
no explanation no sorry !
husband calls me , rosati site still on my computer screen .
horrible customer service !
me : sigh ... .
this location has me thinking twice about renting from them and enterprise in general .
horrible customer service .
do not recommend .
your business should too .
i was assured that it was absolutely vegan and a _num_ % soy product .
not terribly surprised .
not a fan .
watched _num_ people order after us and get their sandwiches before any of us .
horrible .
i would n't bother .
i ordered a turkey sandwich .
are you kidding me ?
not this time .
tough and dry .
but the changes were n't just with the food .
so really , i had a cole slaw sandwich with a little corned beef .
so very disappointed .
the fountain drinks had a really odd taste , especially the diet dr. pepper .
off to find a new cheese steak place , when i can stomach it .
it 's dirty and outdated .
it 's a shame .
it 's dirty and outdated .
it 's a shame .

ca n't wait to move !
i have had over _num_ scorpions in my apartment in _num_ months .
the apartment has sprayed my place twice but it has n't helped at all .
and they never solved that problem .
turn over monthly in that place .
do not rent take your money somewhere else .
the 1st time i went for just a milkshake .
worst experience ever !
they did give me a napkin , yes , one napkin .
you always expect a little wait going through the drive-thru .
i have visited this place before and they are slower than other places .
drive through quickly at 10:30 in the morning .
not the definition of fast food .
very disappointing .
not traditional chinese food .
not worth the money .
i was sick .
the rice was overcooked .
steamed rice -- average ... but how could you screw this up ?
way overcooked .
because i got chicken tenders , not chunks .
do n't eat here .
egg rolls were more spring rolls with thin deep fried paper wrap .
at other chinese places , this is usually less than $ _num_ .
i asked for sauce and mayonnaise was brought to the table .
in my opinion , i would find another dentist office .
very unhappy customer .
i called in , made an appointment .
make another appointment , take more time off .
ranks are questionable at best .
rude rude rude .
i am a gold card member and shop a lot here .
not here .
no courtesy at all .
the repairs were n't fixed very well either .
apartments are n't renovated do n't let them fool you .
the cherry wood cabinets are just painted brown .
the stains in bathtub are just painted with spray paint .
gates are left open all night long .
all my experiences have thus far been satisfactory .
horrible .
no thank you .
i will never be back .
horrible customer service .
i did really like the physician however .
yay !
a sour cream burrito !
the 1st bite is cold shredded cheese and the very next is melted cheese !
cold shredded cheese immediately followed by melted cheese !
perhaps one day i will again venture to this taco bell .
one week later , check engine light comes on .
brought my vehicle back to have check engine light looked at once again .
got truck back , _num_ day later ... check engine light on .
saved $ _num_ .
no appointment scheduled .
now my car is parked at the curb as if it 's done .
use this place for my work vehicle , so not expecting perfection .
appointments do nothing here .
there 's better shops close by , like really close by .
not the place for me though !
ever .
wrong !
ripoff !
oil change , power door on passenger side - having issues with closing .
she insisted i go try on my clothes before giving me an estimate .
!
the service there is hit or miss at best !
no really !
that is not the case here .
if i go back , i will only pay cash !
pretty big portion but at $ _num_ it was a fair price .
well that 's not a good sign !
what the hell !
a big disappointment .
atmosphere was ordinary , but it appeared that they were professional .
?
wo n't be back .
for food , i think the place is overrated .
not even close .
this lobster ravioli was priced around $ _num_ .
was there $ _num_ worth of food there ?
the portion to price ratio is very skimpy .
that 's what got this place _num_ stars .
my vegetables that accompanied my dish were mostly just a pile of red onions .
the manager seemed loud and overbearing .
however , two chances is all i 'm giving .
not impressed .
the portion sizes compared to the price are way off !
it was accompanied with _num_ yellow soaked pieces of pasta .
my wife and i went there last friday night .
but he insisted .
prices were even higher than what they were .
i 've been using them on and off for about _num_ years .
however , i recently took one of my little angels there .
she never recovered .
it only takes one time , and obviously , you just never know .
terrible !
terrible !
terrible !
i felt like they totally took advantage of me , being a young woman .
so we guessed and they replaced that tire .
came here last friday for a routine rotate and balance .
i was given my keys very quickly and thanked .
do i really have to inspect the car after a simple , routine service ?
truly disappointed .
i 'm always hesitant to get automotive stuff done on my own .
i needed _num_ tires and a wheel replaced on my _num_ nissan car .
in short , i followed their process .
hence , the the reason i 'm writing this review .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i wasted my day .
never gon na buy tires from this place ever .
should have stayed with costco .
what good is the appointment if it 's not honored .
does anyone expect a lot from a chinese buffet ?
this place was just half ass .
i also tried the sesame chicken , mongolian beef and sweet and sour pork .
after reading all of the stellar reviews , i was expecting stellar .
made to order sushi `` all u can eat '' bar .
mediocre buffet items .
meh , i have had way better !
i would much rather to to pacific seafood buffet for the same price .
probably had forgotten why .
not good !
from the egg foo young , to the orange and sesame chicken .
no thanks !
i will not be back .
we were very disappointed .
however , compliments to the waiter , who was very friendly .
this review is not in regards to the food .
the meat taste strange , i mean real strange .
nothing gourmet here , greasy fried food .
_num_ persons $ _num_ .
horrible food !
i walk in and manager ( owner ) greets me .
then , he comes back .
then he leaves .
then ... he comes back .
nothing special about this place .
gross !
no thanks !
disgusting !
never again are we going back.
food quality is questionable .
too expensive for what you get .
not a good selection of food .
we ate over half our meals without any refills .
do n't go to hong kong !
avoid !
the food was obviously left out for some time .
we will never return here again .
service is poor !
smelled delicious and there was people eating in the dinning area .
i 've been going to hong kong gourmet buffet for over a decade .
in the past year , i 've eaten here _num_ times .
it does n't make sense .
they refilled the shrimp tempura one time .
they did n't have oysters .
the food here is of very cheap quality .
very disappointing .
very disappointing .
ca n't price match your own website ?
Negative
wrong again .
totally unnecessary .
will not go back ever .
have only been here once before but it was fine .
rude !
orders are often wrong .
this girl needs some serious customer service training .
a disappointment today .
that 's why i asked what you needed .
no apology , nothing .
i left highly annoying .
it takes _num_ seconds to pour .
worst .
it was disgusting .
really , just disgusting .
after tonight , f -- - del taco !
avoid at all costs .
never seen this before in a restaurant , ever .
zero stars .
cheese on half of my nachos , cold fries , etc .
i may not be back !
Neutral
zero stars !
worst customer service ever !
however in this case i must , if i am to tell the truth .
too much time between making the salad and service .
first , i like crusty italian bread , this bread was soft .
just ordered a margherita pizza , large salad and large cannoli .
the service was not that friendly .
went there for dinner on a recommendation and were really let down .
the meatballs tasted as if they were frozen .
bad !
not a fan .
basically , this is mall food court quality stuff .
absolutely not _num_ stars .
food here was bland .
this will come back to bite me , hard .
worst service ever .
this is where the trouble starts .
my experience was horrible .
i am not going back there .
this should not be this way .
i ordered breakfast , which was just alright .
gross .
i abandoned them after a couple of bites .
thinking he was just being difficult , i said he had to eat it .
for years ive been hearing how great this place is ... wth ?
what a disappointment !
maybe lunch would be better ?
never again .
coleslaw was blah .
the waitress could care less .
the salad was small and had lettuce , tomato and that 's it .
my total bill for my plate was _num_ dollars .
if your grandparents are in town , then they will probably like cracker barrel .
very bland menu .
ordered biscuits and gravy with sausage .
went in tonight for the turkey dinner , and chicken fried steak .
i know this is not disneyland !
it was absolutely ridiculous .
that was an insult .
i guess if i had just started going there i would rate it higher .
it 's not anything like it use to be .
i like my scrambled eggs done .
not so good .
the atmosphere is that of a very noisy cafeteria .
raw chicken is serious .
my last visit here was much more pleasant than tonight .
just ca n't do it .
now , for the minus _num_ stars part .
but the more i shop at this albertsons , the more i despise it .
albertsons is my closest grocery store .
they do n't sell your information .
gross !
truly disgusting .
certificate to show their concern .
eh .
the food was not good .
i happily went to the scottsdale quarter and they honored the sale for me .
she always makes unnecessary comments .
left my # every time .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
when i saw how big they were , i was kinda surprised .
the decoration of cpk is okay but it kind of feels like an ihop .
wo n't be back .
where are my caramelized peaches ?
they sent me a coupon for a free salad , that was nice .
was there a shortage of bbq sauce today ?
no biggie .
worst service ever .
i 'm rating this place based on the last waiter we had .
horrific service .
so hats off to you !
bathrooms are extremely disgusting .
worst service ever !
it is disgusting .
nobody wants to eat at a place that smells like that .
it is an on again off again situation .
stopped by today and picked up a fish and chicken taco .
there was salsa all over the seating , really the interior needs a facelift .
i find this annoying .
he responded with $ _num_ .
when i arrived he greeted me as `` one who called '' .
people are not as friendly as some other places .
i got the gel manicure and the spa pedi .
if you go here get a regular manicure not gel .
never going back .
when you are providing a service to someone , stay off the phone .
when i first went in , the lady who greeted me was super friendly .
i would n't return for services .
worst experience ever .
i had cindy , she may be the owner .
ugh .
makeup staff is rude .
i scheduled an appointment with jen for a haircut .
i went to ulta salon because i wanted a cheaper decent haircut .
i would like to give desert ridge cleaners _num_ stars .
i have never seen this before before and i get all my pants hemmed .
and the tailor is n't in on weekends .
avoid at all costs .
avoid !
avoid !
avoid !
also , they advertise `` same day dry cleaning '' .
bad service with poor tailoring .
too much trouble !
`` we will call you '' .
i 've been a customer for more than almost _num_ years .
quantity - here 's where they really fall behind .
for desert ridge i would suggest another place .
not going back .
i am never going back .
it disgusted me .
how this kid can pass inspection and be hired is beyond me .
how could management not see that .
all they put in it was yogurt and a few strawberries for $ _num_ !
not to mention what sub shop runs out of turkey on a sunday ?
terrible .
not good service .
no sense of urgency whatsoever .
will not be back .
this place is gross .
i will not be back .
terrible experience .
and there were more employees than customers in the store .
trash cans overflowing .
i spend a lot of money online and in the store .
they never acknowledged me .
worst experience ever .
all paradise bakeries are busy !
went here for lunch with my husband and _num_ year old .
avoid this place .
they use paper plates and bowls rather than real dishes .
three people at the cash register and only one person making the actual orders .
i finally asked for another cashier and they brought out an equally old cashier .
it was painfully slow .
no complaints there .
they are not accommodating .
i was very disappointed .
and whoever is baking for them needs to take some culinary classes .
they left out the soup and half sandwich as well as the cookies .
so we paid _num_ for a sandwich and half salad .
ordered the tuna .
did n't get it .
that may be why my order got messed up yet again .
the same sales representative that i purchased my products from earlier .
showed the salesman a picture of the item that they were selling .
however , there hours are great !
more money for my dogs .
top of head was halfway done .
this was my dogs 4th visit and now the last .
worst grooming experience ever .
may be he smelled less than he was before grooming .
my fish tacos had room temp .
this place is essentially a jimmy buffett themed tgi fridays .
i am not exaggerating .
disgusting .
i 'd probably regret drinking that much anywhere else .
what a joke .
it was more like a mini slider so definitely not filling .
not very flavorful at all .
nothing like i remember .
i tried a burger too ... definitely not as delish as it was expensive .
i probably would n't return .
how disappointing .
another group of _num_ people came in after us , put their name in .
it feels like the men 's department is just set up as a courtesy .
i can only recommend ross as a desperate last resort .
america is fee 'd to death by businesses like verizon and banks .
their $ _num_ loyalty credit in confusing as well .
money is n't everything in this world .
worst sales reps ever .
they then suggested i go to batteries plus .
anyway , i called verizon .
this place does n't receive a star .
but i guess not .
terrible customer service .
horrible experience .
had an unbelievable experience here .
i was there to upgrade _num_ phone as well .
i hate verizon stores .
it was insulting .
do not go here and do not trust eric !
horrible customer service .
on may 10th i get an e-mail stating my order has shipped .
rock bottom is the reason that i 'm not big on chains .
... especially considering they 're not all that great .
rating _num_ and half .
_num_ of us ordered drinks and i ordered sweets .
it is gross .
so gross !
we had the pretzels to start , which were really good .
the red onion overwhelmed the salad .
waited _num_ mins for service then left .
the food is a tad better than okay .
the service is somewhat mixed , it depends who you get for the evening .
something 's wrong here .
atmosphere is half the rent .
nothing stands out at this pub eatery .
i will not be returning .
slow service .
will not go back !
walk away .
ick .
wings , burgers , chicken , french fries .
so we thought why not .
will not be going back .
the manager was going around apologizing for delays .
he processed our bill and came back .
no , no , and no .
no comment , dead silence .
staff is messing around , watching tv , chatting with friends , etc .
oh , and on top of everything , the place was freezing !
big mistake .
_num_ o'clock and they were packed !
i could n't believe it .
after getting our drinks , we ordered some guacamole and chips as our appetizer .
i got the bruschetta chicken pasta but asked for shrimp instead of chicken .
waitress said no problem .
nothing special .
we used a coupon buy one get on free .
it was ridiculous .
but you have too many .
unacceptable !
Neutral
i was very displeased with the size selections .
terrible staff .
ugh .
the texture of the pasta was funky , hanging out on its own .
the server was attentive enough to notice and brought me more sauce .
appetizer : calamari was yummy .
also the salad is n't great .
and everything else is only fair .
sad really .
i ordered chicken , garlic , broccoli , spinach , and marinara .
this it third time i have tried this location .
my son ordered fettuccine alfredo with chicken .
my son 's fettuccine alfredo showed up sans chicken .
however , this is the third time .
i am beginning to wonder about the management here .
it feels too fast food .
i will have to go back to the one on gold dust .
the food is mediocre .
my husband said we should tip anyways so we tipped _num_ % .
!
and yes !
none at all .
fake chicken ?
bland pasta sauce ?
bland bread ?
actually worse than awful .
getting cold .
shame .
at least not the one at desert ridge .
which ill get to more in a minute .
the food was awful .
truly disappointing .
she finally poured some into the little glasses they use for wine .
no ice .
i can only question : are they understaffed ?
Negative
do they not realize that they are open to the dining area ?
are you stupid ?
Negative
ok super horrible service !
wrong .
but , the long time it took was unreal .
mediocre food .
mediocre service .
he was very unsure of himself and it showed .
what a disaster !
gross .
Negative
she was really in the mood for spaghetti and ordered spaghetti and meatballs .
she did not finish it .
it 's covered in mushrooms , which i 'm allergic to .
.
and the meatballs were reminiscent of frozen cocktail balls in my opinion .
and this was not even close .
this is wine not tang .
too little too late .
it was a disaster .
most of the other reviews will support my experience .
the next morning i put the skirt on and carefully took off the tag .
she cut too far back and too far to the sides .
ugh .
the fries were horrible .
even wendy 's or burger king fries are better .
will not go back .
the staff showed little care for their product .
very little customer service .
not impressed .
were empty .
the bagels themselves were fine , as was the cream cheese .
i keep searching for something healthy on the menu but can not find it .
i ordered a turkey sandwich on a thin bagel .
horrible service .
a long line at an einstein is to be expected on a saturday morning .
horrible service .
i 'm still standing here waiting for the food i just paid for .
sooooo slow .
terrible customer service !
that is not acceptable .
she did not offer me a receipt .
stick to starbucks or dutch bros if you want quality coffee .
what a disappointment .
bad bad bad !
i was wrong !
it was n't even that busy .
cheap as can be .
we sat down in a booth .
gross !
i sent all the food back .
while their food was good , they sure did skimp on the quantity .
you get _num_ star for your store being clean .
clerks behind the counter and _num_ register running .
they kept pushing me to add all these extras .
got a standard car wash for $ _num_ and it was pretty subpar .
so nothing was resolved .
i would still never bring another car there again .
they are extremely unprofessional .
that is not customer service .
batteries are under the wheel well , yikes .
stupid bad .
horrible service .
bad haircut .
terrible service !
the place needs major major surgery !
my guess is the business is probably out for sale .
this place sucks .
been there once before , but not my favorite .
be very weary of this place if you are not a local .
avoid this company !
i just called for a quote to clean windows and base boards .
no thanks !
stay away from this pharmacy .
bull .
worst pharmacy .
horrible customer service .
i drive away and am having my prescription transferred to another pharmacy .
might want to think about the people you hire .
the pharmacy is _num_ hours and generally always busy .
i do n't expect perfection .
and her attitude was not pleasant .
not very happy with it .
the chicken fries also seem to sit out before being ordered .
not in my case .
i got the lettuce wraps , tiger shrimp , and chocolate souffle .
what a complete disappointment !
would this deter me from another visit to roy 's ?
maybe this is one of reasons why they have closed down the scottsdale location !
the restaurant is fancy , upscale , expensive , romantic , etc .
i was offered pasta & artichoke .
i do n't consider myself a picky eater , and i love seafood .
the drinks were tasty but pricey which is expected for the setting .
for $ 30-40 per entree , you can do far better .
times are getting better , much better .
i 've eaten all over the world , i 'm somewhat experienced .
it was just appalling .
totally screwed .
two ribs , pieces of chicken , shrimp , potstickers and sushi rolls .
overdone , dry .
not going back .
sat outside where it was a beautiful evening .
mahi was dry .
salmon not cooked thoroughly .
this time nothing .
the pot stickers had been under the heat lamp way to long .
so slow !
waited _num_ min between courses .
food was good , not the service i expect at its price point .
disappointing .
for the price point you 'd believe it would be fantastic .
not so much .
a few were very loud and instantly , roy 's became a pub .
roy 's invited this by setting up this seating area .
they need lots of training in customer service and guest satisfaction .
it is not !
shrimp was bland .
very mediocre meal .
had an apple desert where they fire roasted the apple .
was nasty .
did n't eat it .
you 'll save money and have a better meal .
butter fish was awful .
this time was disappointing .
the caesars salad was wilted and somewhat brown .
they serve me sake wine glass !
meal # _num_ was filet mignon with teppanyaki shrimp .
i asked for it to be cooked for a little longer and they obliged .
it was not .
only went here because we were early for our movie that was next door .
looks like a converted subway with an actual grill .
my wrap was sad .
just not for me .
worst part ... .
their quality is terrible .
i got transferred without notice ... then nicole answers the phone .
the first time , the groomer was found outside , smoking .
very very disappointing .
too much .
also , the artichoke dip , sliders and tacos .
artichoke dip = large jar of mayo .
be careful not to sit next to the kitchen .
noisy !
terrible service .
i did n't try it .
the bill arrived and to my surprise the chicken sandwich was still on there .
others around us had similar problems .
elephant bar and grill is americanized version of asian food .
sadly .
very boring .
for lunch , it 's a decently priced meal for a lot of grub .
very scary episode for me .
i also tried their pork banh mi sandwich .
horrible .
i would not return here again .
ate here for lunch the other day , food was pretty meh .
really really bad .
* rice noodles in my chicken pho are gummy .
* bean sprouts are brown / old .
bad form .
this is an attempt at pho and vietnamese food .
not a fan of americanized pho .
what a huge disappointment .
sick .
they could have cared less .
terrible service .
the top was cover entirely with onions and green onions .
rip off .
for lunch i ordered the number # _num_ bun w/ beef .
literally was a few pieces of beef and the rest was all noodles .
went in tonight to try this place out .
so disappointing .
very disappointing .
skimpy on the noodles in the pho bowls .
the looks that chef would get from the workers and customers would be epic !
ridiculous .
it does not sound true .
terrible experience .
i had a questionable experience with this dealership .
when i asked what had been done , they only did the recall .
audi north scottsdale literally stole my car from me .
either way i would strongly recommend avoiding this place , especially their service department .
very disappointed .
do not go to this dealership !
needless to say , my experience with chandler bmw was much better last year .
got some salesperson , do n't remember his name .
oh well - probably a sign not to buy a car here .
i would never come back .
so , now im left to taking them to court to sort this out .
i like everything mix together not just piled on top .
there is nothing immediate about this facility .
nothing urgent about this place .
poor procedure inside .
the worst service ever !
do not visit this location !
not really customer service oriented .
i will not be returning .
she quickly said .
ca n't do it .
they have driven me to cook my own chinese food .
no complaints here .
food is horrible now .
it just seems that they are using cheaper products but have still raised prices .
service is horrible .
hour and _num_ later not ready .
poor quality meats .
i never get sick !
i never get sick !
i highly recommend not using this location .
i finally just walked out .
the receptionist is rude .
ok , can you get me in on sunday or another day ?
i was very embarrassed .
no banana outlet ?
this is a strange little complex of stores that calls itself an outlet mall .
they could definitly upgrade on alot of their stores to become alot better .
the experience they had was way less than pleasant .
that 's too bad .
they do n't care !
they do n't deserve your hard earned money .
she knew beyond question that she was far better than me .
even the ones that are meant to go in the microwave are questionable .
pizza might be good if it was hot .
unbelievable .
it makes me cry every time i walk in and out of this store .
secondly , the prices on most of the things are very over over-priced .
also , the miniature dog bed prices are out of this world .
poor customer service .
way to reward loyal customers domino 's .
put in an online order for a couple pizzas and cheesy bread .
disgusting !
it 's not a difficult job .
but not this one .
wrong .
not even domino 's .
it was tasteless and soggy .
not to mention it was extremely expensive .
totally disappointed .
this is not it !
we have ordered pizza from this location on several occasions .
no call ... .
was i disappointed .
tough , over cooked , half cold .
_num_ stars for the drive through .
last time i come to this location ever !
absolutely horrible customer service .
bad attitude and no personality .
maybe someone can open a dutch bros in anthem .
also , i spend about _num_ $ a month on starbucks me alone .
not going back .
just horrible !
they are so slow .
no urgency .
bad customer service rude and nasty .
home depot has much better pricing and better customer service .
low quality and not very authentic .
this place is disgusting !
manager did n't care at all .
out of the entire store there is only one friendly guy up front .
worst customer service ever .
horrible food .
disgusting .
it also took a long time to order another beer and our check .
an adequate sports bar if you need one .
not good .
i came here with _num_ adults and _num_ kids ( all under _num_ ) .
big mistake .
no just more styrofoam .
on the positive , restaurant seems cleaner .
beyond that , restaurant remains subpar .
i was disappointed .
hamburger and fries were cold .
typical prepared , previously frozen bar food .
mediocre food .
mediocre service .
mediocre decor and atmosphere .
terrible snob attitudes !
not impressed .
zero stars .
he ordered multiple x rays of my _num_ month old son .
because of location , i chose a pediatrician closer to my home in peoria .
awful cut and awful experience .

sub-par produce .
frequented by creepy `` hills have eyes '' people at all times .
like , literally .
uh , ok.
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
stupid expensive !
the staff is hit and miss .
too bad .
not when i 'm the only customer in the store though .
if you have options do n't stop here after 11pm .
not the best location .
the other waitress could have covered up some .
restaurant full of smoke when we walked in .
lots of mushrooms but not much meatball .
almost to the point of being too much .
checked out this place from the groupon last night .
friday night at _num_ most tables were full one server .
until then , avoid .
it was soo greasy and a bit salty .
service was not very friendly .
place looks like it needs some tlc .
the pizza was thin , cheesy , and greasy .
if you decide to try this place stick to pizza with marinara sauce .
if you decide to try this place stick to pizza with marinara sauce .
much less sauce and cheese on the pie .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i remember it being much better a long , long time ago .
unfortunately i ordered pasta .
my husband got pizza , and i tried a bite .
customer service was meh .
if i 'm going out for pizza , i go to venezia 's pizzeria .
the next visit we decided to stick to the plain cheese pizza .
it is awful !
we did n't even finish our slices .
so terrible .
the pizza was garbage .
well , it looks like i am back to square one .
i purchased a groupon for this place and finally got around to using it .
no big deal ... .
it just meant we had plenty of time to second guess our ordering decisions .
_num_ tables being used .
but no .
this time was n't so good .
tasted horrible .
_num_ years .
it 's inexcusable for a restaurant to serve what i was served this evening .
i have been here two times and that 's gon na be it .
did i mention the sandwich was completely overpriced as well ?
she said they would honor the groupon .
lousy service with incompetent employees .
i ca n't speak to the dine-in experience since we took it home .
very heavy on the cheese and very little sauce .
totally unacceptable !
horrible !
and , they charge for rice .
this time around though , i felt like i wanted to kill myself .
we walked in , it was busy .
bottom line ... .
)
tonight makes me want to change my mind .
i walked in and then straight back out .
terribly .
if you like wings , go to another store and get the good ones .
this one does not .
horrible service .
i 'm really unimpressed .
he was awesome and trained the other servers .
they 're clearly struggling to find their way .
the prices went up over _num_ bucks for a dozen wings .
i wish they would go back and purchase quality wings .
horrible experience tonight !
according to our server , this happens every monday .
the kitchen just seems to fall apart she says .
went in to grab some lunch after my haircut .
terrible service .
have n't been to native in awhile and decided to try them out again .
the wings were good but too much sauce in my opinion .
the server was horrible .
rude .
horrible college !
not just once , but several times .
this is crap .
seriously so annoyed .
they deserve 4/5 or 5/5 stars .
i walked in and asked for a quote on the rates .
then gave me a quote of _num_ a month for a one bedroom .
the previous tenant was getting calls all hours of the night , every night .
the guy above me sounded like he was moving furniture until _num_ am .
_num_ bed bug can have _num_ 's of babies .

seriously , find somebody else .
the reviews on this page are _num_ % accurate .
i 'm pissed .
i was n't that impressed .
having been here before , i knew what to expect .
two of the four dryers nearly dried my clothes in one cycle .
past _num_ years have been back , maybe once a month .
horrible customer service .
this is insane .
does n't stop us from getting our midnight shakes though !
i live close by .

just ridiculous !
bad business and bad services .
i hope they shut this place down !
teriyaki chicken was nothing special .
curry chicken just was n't good .
almost too big really .
my chicken was so plain .

very disappointing experience .
this place has me fucking furious .
it was just really scary to go that long in a hospital without help .

poor service culture here .
dash off to another firm .
they just want to see numbers not a quality visit .
what an impersonal treatment !
simply they do not care .
the bacon in my burrito was raw for starters .
there carne asada with more like dog food .
everyone has bad days .
i wait , and i wait , and i wait some more .
ok , ok i thought to myself .
just kidding , out again .

also there were hairs in the sandwiches from the guy who made them .
not pleasant .

eh it 's nothing special .
but every time i ever get food from here there 's an issue .

_num_ stars for roasted meats .
hello , we 're trying to send you a message idiot .
well what can i say about best hong kong ?
the service is terrible .
my girlfriend and i tried this place out for the first time .
the food was slightly warm and got cold the minute i started eating .

service is sooo bad !
roasted duck is mediocre .
i ordered cashew chicken lunch special .
terrible service .
massive disappointment .

Neutral

just ramen and a lump of curry paste .
avoid this place .
but everything just seems off .
i would not order sushi here .
the tuna was not fresh .
there was nobody at this place .
the food was alright , but the service was abysmal .
what a disappointment !
overall , the food was better than i expected for a place in phoenix .
even when they make eye contact , they ignore you .
they did not even smile .
i wish we could have given him all the tip .
menu not big enough for me .
yes .
our service was terrible .
it is not easy to get the waitress 's attention .
another _num_ to get our drinks .
they give complimentary salad which includes iceberg lettuce ... and teriyaki sauce .
no thanks .
it should be thin , and tender , and flavorful .
it blows this place away on all levels .
rude .
probably the last time i 'm coming here .
i 'm asian , so that make me a automatic expert on korean food .
not worth eating out .
i never stiff wait staff , having worked in food service myself .
however , they added a mandatory _num_ % gratuity to our bill .
i mean , really ?
but they are constantly busy , bringing out food to other tables .
but every cart is full of those side dish and the potatoes were there .
pissed me off .
too slow .
so bad .
i taste nothing but salty overly done chicken meat .
first , i would like to say that the staff and waiters were nice .
so overall my experience was a _num_ and a half of _num_ .
the two waitresses were running like crazy .
the seafood pancake had only a couple of tiny shrimps in it .
well , chinese take-out is at least cheap .
very bad service .
: ( went out , and went back to throw up .
: ( i truly felt like i was going to die .
rushed me to hospital .
he also gave me a gift card for future use .
plus the food has always been a hit or miss .
the only constant thing i have enjoyed is the kimchi pancakes .
there are better korean restaurants around .
looking back directly at three other servers as they just stand around talking .
ca n't be all random .
service is so bad .
i know , weird .
$ _num_ for spicy pork ?
both of our dishes tasted less appetizing than usual .
rude !
worst experience ever !
they 've been here _num_ times and it is not fixed .
absolutely crap .
do not use this company .
poor customer service !
the ones i used to go to in louisiana were good .
they had etouffee and mardi gras cheesecake that were great .
this one is awful .
the chicken was old and not fresh .
my friend and i had a craving for fried chicken on a saturday night .
like previous reviews stated the restaurant is very messy .
i ate my chicken , even though i ordered spicy they gave me mild .
restaurant could use a deep cleaning as its quite aged .
but tonight was terrible .
usually find myself trying to get in and out rather quickly .
you might even be asked for money in the parking lot .
normally have to repeat myself a few times to get the order correct .
ca n't resist getting several jalapenos to give the meal some additional kick .
tried the catfish on my last visit and was surprised how small it looked .
horrible service .
do n't ever walk our of here without checking your order .
service here is horrible .
poor quality and awful management .
this location is terrible .
i went there today to get a simple _num_ piece mild dinner .
my problem is the employees .
now ca n't even get money back .
picked up _num_ strips and _num_ fish strips and fries .
i think i 've ate there twice today my first and my last .
i was not happy .
i was incredibly disappointed .
after a long summer in flip flops i really needed this service done .
not a good nail salon .
it 's just loose money .
last weekend i had my bridal shower and got my mani done here .
not impressed .
if you like good coffee you do n't like starbucks .
Negative
very low tech .
they are n't willing to work with you .
then the servers just happened to crash .
first thing i did was hang up .
i was sent to the new chandler location , though .
three visits so unnecessary if everything had been done right the first time .
this is ridiculous .
very professional considering i had made the appointment a month before .
it was $ _num_ .
this place was terrible .
very poor service !
the cooks were n't paying attention to portion or size control .
they brought me frozen creme brulee .
the waiter never poured the wine after the initial pour .
the staff was n't very friendly .
and someone finally greeted me after i already looked around the whole store .
i was so upset i had to get outta there .
it seems like the place is run by teenagers .
so disappointing .
avoid , avoid , avoid .
just out to make a quick buck in an expensive industry .
avoid at all costs .
extremely disappointed .
our old instructor mr brian was awesome .
the reason why this place get 's two stars is mr. brian .
if you do decide to go here , only go to mr. brian .
after that , quit .
yes is cheaper , but you deserve better .
horrible business .
_num_ .
_num_ .
then tried to charge me more money !
_num_ .
the tux did not fit .
_num_ .
stay away .
i have been going here for years .
the bottom line , our end is taken care of .
this is all according to our health care .
it 's come to the point that urgent care has become her primary place .
we kept the same appointment time with another physician .
needless to say we left .
double ear infection , fever over _num_ and needed meds for her .
the gilbert office was booked so we were referred to the chandler office .
two things that i would assume to be common since .
not planning to stay here again with so many other options .
three of us stayed here for an event that was happening in mesa .
the staff at the desk was friendly and check in was very fast .
i woke up drenched in sweat and hearing this loud noise .
the hotel looked really , really old .
avoid at all cost !
manager danny rude .
ghetto shit hole !
this place is awful .
wrong !
the room was clean but had a strong musty odor .
dirty , stinks horribly !
could n't wait to leave .
pillows small and lumpy .
breakfast mediocre .
the motel is old point blank .
but still could use a little more tlc .
should n't of done it .
we only stayed two nights .
my room key did n't work .
still , a pain in the butt .
oranges , apples , bananas .
also , it had only four small , really tiny pillows on the bed .
i called the front desk again , only this time a girl answered .
there were bottle caps on the floor , as well as a used tissue .
not a place i would stay again .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
Negative
this place is awful .
apparently most people feel the same .
we checked out as soon as we saw our room .
then the a/c went out in our new room .
even though i had a contract booked _num_ months in advance .
do n't bother .
but plan to wait forever for your car .
i did not buy their tire .
i will not shop there again .
the food was ok nothing special .
their hollandaise sauce was sooo salty .
not impressed at all .
tired .
the place seems tired .
first , i find a bug in my water .
_num_ scrambled eggs , bacon , english muffin and potatoes .
sure do miss our old good egg .
now the bacon is thin , cheap , blah bacon .
no thanks .
lame .
alas , it 's time to find a new place for pancakes .
this has been one of our favorite breakfast places for years .
since the change we have not had _num_ good experience .
just cheap pizza that is good enough to eat .
jimmy and joes pizza blows this away .
he was very defensive .
she put me on hold a total of _num_ times .
i walked in on a friday night and ordered a large pepperoni pizza .
disappointed .
i just wish they were consistent at every location with quality .
holy grease balls !
the franchise manager never contacted me .
it definitely depends on what you are looking for .
so disappointing .
do n't ever try to return anything to this store .
they sold me a used jazz piano book for the full $ _num_ price .
totally absurd .
worst experience ever .
on top of that , more procedures were added that were never discussed .
Neutral
thought it was a bit weird that the chicken was dark meat .
terrible .
holy crap .
all the chicken and pork : overdone .
just decided to try this place tonight on a whim .
i ordered the drunken noodles and the golden tofu from the thai menu .
the person on the phone needs to learn how to communicate better .
that 's very odd to me .
i 'm looking elsewhere .
ugh .
we wandered around and went in the back area where all the cages were .
then we saw the back area where they have the boarded birds , etc .
ugh .
overly crowded is putting it mildly .
one baby had hopped up on top and later flew down to the floor .
while he walked around with us he was feeding french fries to the birds .
the name phoenix children 's has a trusted name , sure .
2nd visit _num_ week later to cast arm .
i do n't usually write this sort of review but i am so livid .
it gets worse ... .
i could n't believe it .
he is awful .
no kidding !
we got in quickly , waited awhile between nurses , doctor and x-rays .
overall , that part of my visit was a typical urgent care experience .
i asked for a supervisor and spoke to manuel .
pathetic .
i am so disappointed .
horrible .
completely unnecessary !
handle the stress ladies , its just a coffee shop .
it 's faster to drive a little bit further out to get better service .
line out the door an _num_ people working .
step it up and hire some more people already !
this has been my experience the past _num_ times in here ... .
i had two tires replaced on my _num_ honda .
goes off and says let me tell the tech .
stay away from sears auto !
got there on time , dude said _num_ hour .
its a freaking oil change .
it takes _num_ minutes !
i went to sears as my engine light came on .
i just leave after that .
i was at discount tire earlier in the day better service and quicker .
worst service ever !
buy your books from amazon its cheaper and better return policy !
worst place ever .
this is that goodwill .
terrible customer service !
probably never coming back .
place was way understaffed .
the lanes that are currently open are for league players .
this is now completely unfair to the people she initially turned away .
of course there is now another `` _num_ minute waiting period . ''
_num_ minutes away .
the management needs to start training better here .
terrible customer service .
will not come back .
never had a problem .
they are horrible !
rent a car from any other place .
absolutely miserable and frustrating experience .
i called as soon as i left because the tire light came on .
rude horrible service .
called and spoke to someone whose name i dont remember .
terrible service !
but then there is now way to change an appt .
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
i then waited an additional hour just to be called into an exam room .
my experience is not a novelty visit like some posts on here .
sugar attracts more flies than vinegar .
can i give them _num_ stars ?
she was a bit nicer .
all ra patients are suffering due to his quit .
!
we can forward your medical records to them .
find another dr immediately .
wrong .
rude !
he was as cranky as the _num_ year old .
nobody ever died from being nice .
food was really bland .
i 'm sure it was the style in _num_ or so .
hard to finish without liquid .
been coming here once a week for _num_ months .
chicken fried steak and eggs was my fave .
she left the receipt without a word .
very short review , village inn let down today .
took a long time for anyone to come over to get our drinks .
being my birthday i was really craving crepes .
its something i only get on special occasions .
i was really excited to get them .
wait , wait , waiting .
so disappointed .
really sorry .
gross !
no second chances here .
terrible service !
service was terrible .
food was bland .
they have less than _num_ % of life than any other type of lighting .
such a disappointment !
my son is _num_ .
i can not tell you enough about what a jerk he was !
this is not the way ordering should work .
i asked if it was peking chicken , and she said yes .
it was that bad .
but i needed my bill .
my waitress did n't do anything .
have been coming to golden canyon for at least _num_ years .
very poor staff training .
have been coming to golden canyon for at least _num_ years .
very poor staff training .
chicken was way overlooked .
because of the language barrier they can seem a little rough around the edges .
i am rating strictly on my experience today with take out .
seriously , how rude .
we have been going to golden canyon chinese for _num_ years .
we stopped in at golden canyon on saturday feb _num_ for a friends birthday .
it seems the staff was busy counting cookies and not waiting on tables .
bathroom was terrible .
wo n't be back .
was disappointed .
got our drinks quickly .
food was mediocre .
chicken marsala needed more sauce and mushrooms .
what a crap experience !
horrible horrible service !
i spoke too soon .
she wants you to quickly buy what you will and then get out .
i want to go the distance , to another place next time .
i just have n't got much good to say about going here .
my lil man came in with a temp of _num_ when _num_ was normal .
horrible !
never bring your pet to this place .
they are not trustworthy or loving to pets at all .
ridiculous !
ridiculous !
my advise find another black owned barbershop to go to .
i suggest albertsons for all meat purchases .
i have been using this pharmacy practically my entire life .
she 's rude .
i dread picking up prescription from her .
i have three dogs and five cats and they are my children !
the service is mediocre .
the bathroom is stinky , i had to hold my breathe .
terrible !
the windows carpet and booths could have all used a good cleaning .
nobody knew how to run the cash register .
this is the second ( and last ) time i 've come here .
the muffin came out quickly and was decent .
consider yourself warned .
the service completely sucked !
i was extremely offended .
i signed online to schedule an appt .
is closed for renovations this week .
if not , you were probably transferred to a different therapist .
if you want deep tissue , book him .
i provided direct feedback through the massage envy survey six days ago .
recently i went in with my dog .
i will not be back .
also , we might have drinking water but , that is it .
desert trees are only what he has in his yard as he told me .
worse customer service !
)
poor service today .
i run up to the door and ... .
staff ignored me .
they are not parent friendly !
not female friendly !
_num_ months , nothing has changed .
the play area was just a few balls and some toys and a tv .
things get fixed fairly quickly .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
there is usually a wait , especially in winter .
the last two visits we have made have both been for birthday dinners .
unfortunately it was n't .
i 'm hoping someone in our party had mashed potatoes .
it may have tasted better if the experience was better .
very mushy .
but not great to me .
maybe they would 've been better .
he did n't seem to care .
terrible !
we will not go back .
service wasnt all that great this time .
i would opt out in eating chicken and steak here .
: ( rosemary chicken needed more sauce as well .
the tiramisu was gross .
terrible service .
i will not be back !
will not come back .
sorry olive garden .
worst dining experience .
she put us down , but when she did it was for _num_ people .
extremely disappointed with service .
would not recommend .
we picked up some togo food tonight from olive garden .
i would hate to work with her .
foods still bomb though .
the waitress was nice , but seemed really stressed and in a hurry .
my experience at the gilbert location was awesome compared to this one .
fist time i was there someone threatened to shoot up the place .
the service is nonexistent .
they are n't bright !
they are rude !
this night , sarah served my first beer .
keep in mind , i am by myself at the end of the bar .
this joint attracts shady characters because of their cheap prices .
not a place to go alone to have a drink .
cheap drinks and full of native americans .
this place is not for me .
this place is horrible !
i 'm not new to mediterranean food .
however , this was my first attempt at eating falafel .
here it 's horrible .
i ca n't recommend this place for a date or for families .
it 's just mediocre .
service is all over the place .
inconsistent .
why not treat all of your customers that way ?
inconsistent quality of food .
customer service _num_ out _num_ !
their selection was incredibly limited .
the food was not memorable .
other salespeople are just standing there .
i go to the back to wait for my husband to get done .
no apology for poor customer service .
there was no excuse .
i was in the office purchasing my glasses for _num_ hours !
my rx is very week .
it was not edible .
i have eaten chinese in hawaii , japan and california .
the place really needs to catch up about _num_ years .
in fact , my egg foo young tasted a little spoiled .
my dining companion had the garlic chicken and it was a little slimy .
too bad .
you 've been warned !
went for lunch after recently returning to the valley of the sun .
not much to write about my lunch .
portion was small .
boring .
probably wont be back .
disappointing .
i feel like a stone cold sucker !
my friend and i were the only ones there .
the food was mediocre .
the rice was cold .
no acknowledgement for _num_ min .
it 's not even busy .
_num_ minutes later .
it was pathetic .
!
if he treats customers like this , imagine how he treats staff .
completely absurd customer service !
will be filing a report with the bbb !
poor professionalism .
my wait was _num_ hours .
not even kidding .
as for the salon itself , everyone else was courteous and clean .
it looked very run down .
also , the selection of gel polish colors was dismal .
so i really needed a fill and color today .
i ordered a combo plate , trying a beef enchilada and a chicken taco .
i would not come here again .
i was mildly annoyed .
was this bad ?
he 's _num_ , he likes `` mildly seasoned '' .
wo n't be returning .
i cant think of any reason that would be acceptable .
we got _num_ percent off .
but so me one please give me a reason why i should go back ?
no refills were offered .
my huevos was around $ _num_ .
thumbs down for this place .
i was craving mexican food .
our selection for tonight was rosita 's .
the pricing for most of the menu very over priced .
the whole reason to dine out is to be served and taken care of .
for $ _num_ .
four tacos for $ _num_ .
dude just needed to listen better .
food came out extremely quick , soon enough i 'd realize why .
mexican food ai n't fancy food .
worse attitude ever .
on the other hand ... dave the finance guy was a god sent .
this is the second time i 've gotten shit from these guys .
very poor service .
i wish they were a reputable dealership .
should maybe take in to consideration that she has a customer waiting .
one of the bottom _num_ restaurants in my entire life .
_num_ ) i ordered kung pao chicken .
horrible horrible establishment .
my eating partner just had an egg drop soup .
it was not over fried .
i did not eat it .
there is nothing here that you want .
ordered _num_ chicken dishes .
lame school .
i was wrong .
the pants were replaced on the spot .
you ca n't button your jacket properly without it !
i try to give businesses the benefit of the doubt .
the people that work here only care about commission and not the customer .
the representative who helped me kept bringing me more and more shirts .
_num_ stars given for the attitude when i came to do a return .
they are practically identical shirt in a slightly different fabric ) .
no stars from me !
right off the bat i could tell that she worked off of commission .
do you really need to be that desperate ?
only myself and one other customer were there .
yelp says it opens at 9am .
google says it opens at 10am .
so i went at _num_ am .
wasted my time there .
i walked into this store to buy chocolates for mother 's day .
no dice .
i went in looking for ski boots that would fit a very narrow foot .
too busy today .
i walked in to get a mani/pedi with my friend .
my pedicure was $ _num_ .
( and acted like it was me being high maintenance ) .
_num_ times .
_num_ times !
ugh .
horrible customer service .
i do not recommend this company .
1st off , , , staff there is stellar .
left with nothing .
took hours to get him ready !
this place is horrible !
as i walked in the store , the counter guy was on the phone .
wrong !
the majority of it is _num_ 's & _num_ 's rock .
i was very disappointed .
the staff is much friendlier at barry 's too .
really !
bad business all around !
barry is not .
i miss fiesta mall .
fix your debit machine on the pumps or at least require a zip code !
i waited one minute and nothing .
stopped here in a hurry and ... we deeply regretted it .
there was a lot of profit in that little burrito .
this place is so crowded .
went to the appointment and everyone upfront was extremely friendly .
they just replaced the lens with the same script .
so , now that it 's my last year , i have had it .
the hours clearly say they open at nine .
valentine 's day is not a national holiday .
the area it 's in is practically dying and it 's very unsafe .
they treated me horribly .
when i talk to my neighbors everybody feels the same towards the management .
they said we turned the ac down to low and it broke .
i also had a lot of problems with the washer and dryers .
i 'm starting to regret i even considered calling this apt my home .
no biggie .
i will not have them back !
after finally fixing gates so they operated properly , they wanted final payment .
this was an $ _num_ job !
i would highly recommend using a different company for your garage door needs .
very disappointing experience .
even for fast food i just ca n't stomach it .
so we wait .
_num_ minutes roll by .
jalapeno poppers ( _num_ ) had a bitter taste .
$ _num_ which someone would open a decent fast food on this corner .
and a friend of mine .
do not visit this location !
horrible place .
?
so if you are craving sonic , just go to a different location .
very poor service .
if i could give less than _num_ star i would .
i only got a medium strawberry limeade .
dumped it all out and found lettuce in it .
today - nasty .
they offered to swap it out for a comparable item , and we agreed .
said item was $ _num_ more .
so annoyed .
no response again .
this is officially the last time i will ever come here .
what the actual hell .
diet coke was flat .
so , i was very excited to find this place .
but , no .
very bland .
i also would like to say that it 's not just this store either .
over the past year , their propane exchange kiosk has only worked once .
how rude !
i will not be back !
_num_ ) the cleanliness .
_num_ ) water bottles .
what a ripoff .
pizza hut is terrible !
big mistake .
then just last weekend i ordered a different pizza because they were on sale .
big mistake !
lame .
i ordered online and chose a future delivery time of _num_ pm .
the first time we ordered and had it delivered , everything was awesome .
omg , really ?
umm , no .
then 3rd was tonight , forgot an order of breadsticks , i ordered two .
there will not be a 4th .
the crust was like a pizza stone .
bad choice .
more expensive than most of the sushi places in mesa .
if i could give this less then _num_ star i would .
the chef came out then promptly dumped the veggies and raw meat together .
food was ok , nothing special .
the dog sat on her lap while they ate .
it was very disappointing .
are you looking for the cure for your sushi cravings ?
do you wish that you could be permanently rid of your roll addiction ?
then businesses wonder why they are going under .
i visited the location on gilbert and southern tonight .
this is place will close down before to long .
so disappointing .
but the service needs to be a focus in this place .
it 's a brioche bun that 's kind of hard .
also , the `` what ? ''
that was it , i was done .
i had purchased an online coupon quite a long time ago .
this review concerns a visit i made to the store approximately _num_ weeks ago .
wanted to try this place out so i went there the other day .
horrible customer service !
chips and salsa are complimentary .
i was disappointed .
we will not be coming back .
my wife chose a bean , egg , and cheese , breakfast burrito .
i walked in , ordered some food to go .
disgusting !
duh , the more expensive one , the protein bistro .
_num_ and still showed an available award .
even machines that work could use maintenance .
but if you are even remotely considering going to this gym .
equipment is old dirty .
parking sucks .
rude !
this gym only cares about its numbers .
these places are not exceptional at all .
how about the $ _num_ minimum to get in ?
the sound was n't impressive .
their 3d movies seem to be outrageously priced .
very rude .
all the customers at the movie theater were high and jerks .
probably the last time we visit an amc theater .
very poor customer service .
they actually charge more than harkins !
my back is still killing me .
smaller theater , late showing .
the movie volume was very low for some reason .
not at those prices .
there was nobody there on a friday night .
the prime theater is ok if you do n't mind the extra price .
i rarely ever use another theater , until now .
terrible terrible place !
andrew is lucky for these ladies because he by myself , turns customers away .
boring .
w walked in and the atmosphere seemed decent too .
i was disappointed .
my husband got the wood grilled blackened halibut , and it was tiny .
they were dry and had very little flavor .
by the time it arrived everyone else was done their meal .
red lobster would probably have been better and cheaper too .
seating was very quick ; they are n't crowded at lunch .
there is no coleslaw .
the reply was '' oh , yes , another vegetable . ''
overall our only positives were the side salads .
completely ruined .
inspect your gear thoroughly before leaving the shop .
nothing was wilted or sour .
the fruit was in good shape , too .
they offer baked sweet potatoes as well as baked potatoes .
officially switching over to another pharmacy .
they did bring out pizza to satisfy a little bit of our hunger .
no personality at all .
it 's a noodle with ricotta cheese in it .
yet another disappointment .
totally terrible service .
i recommend getting the chicken marsala though .
it 's ridiculous !
worst service ever .
their use of the word feast borders on deceptive advertising .
the food is only ok .
very disappointing .
it seems so unsanitary .
i do n't need every drink and appetizer described to me .
seriously gross .
again - gross .
it was positively dripping in pesto cream sauce .
really , really unpleasant .
overall a huge disappointment .
the food is greasy and sits like a lump in your stomach .
downside , they use processed white wheat when they make the food .
talk about overpriced and not very good .
chopped antipasto salad and it 's not chopped very well .
we recently ate at buca in st paul near the airport .
not a very good take out experience .
chicken parm was bland .
bread was stale .
love they take you to your seat through the kitchen .
the waiter brought our drinks and some house bread .
we had the chicken parmesan , which was good .
just downright nasty .
worse than the food .
_num_ ) ick .
ridiculous !
_num_ ) .
very bland .
no exaggeration .
really disappointing .
seriously do n't bother .
weird sewer smell and dusty everywhere .
will not be back .
literally zero flavor !
Positive
family style dining not really my thing .
it tasted like nothing .
severely disappointed in this place .
then are entrees came in which was much smaller than i thought .
service was not good either .
the prosciutto chicken was delicious , but the portion was small for $ _num_ .
_num_ plus tax .
brutal .
just came here for mothers day pickup for catering .
i am going to cook burgers .
forget these clowns on a holiday .
gross !
what a disaster .
the waiter brought out dinner plates which i passed out .
not digging that .
gross .
it is processed crap .
plus the alfredo sauce was laughable .
however , if you ever need to go order , pass it up .
it was in a small catering tin and was probably 1/3 full of food .
very , very disappointed .
incredibly horrible service .
very disappointed .
they appreciate the customers they get , as should every restaurant .
it was awful .
friendly wait staff .
if the occasion called for it , i 'd come back .
horrible `` food '' !
would like to see them make it a little more user friendly .
rude employees here .
oh ok ... so that makes it ok then i guess .
she came back stating the turtle was indeed turning himself over .
apparently she was upset that we cared too much for a turtle .
shame shame shame .
took our _num_ 1/2 yr old lab here for doggie day care .
this particular petsmart need to do a better job at training their employees .
she is almost _num_ yr old .
so that visit was so-so .
now _num_ months later i made sure i scheduled with someone else .
so disappointed .
do not recommend .
never dealing with petsmart again .
no more .
was petsmart taken over by new ownership ?
did petsmart forget they have competition ?
i suggest going to a competitor or buying online for your pet supplies .
so , that 's why i ca n't rate this place very well .
really ?
my waitress said no .
totally ridiculous .
i will not be back .
they are always fall of the bone tender .
oh , get rid of the cinnamon butter .
the big problem were the ribs for me .
not impressed .
although , the group selected afterwards were seated promptly .
idiots !
i was here on monday night for my moms birthday dinner .
not vegan friendly .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
does n't value paying customers !
ps reading their facebook comments , others experienced the same as we did .
poor management !
horrible food .
tonight was one of those nights .
ate it all , then came the entree .
all i asked for was sour cream and butter on the potato .
again , it was me having a little food with my salt .
she sent gets back .
this restaurant must have stock in blood pressure meds .
sorry , texas roadhouse .
horrible customer service .
the hostess asked how many people we reply _num_ adults _num_ children .
i came here on a wednesday night with a friend .
when they arrived , the rib 's were good , chicken was cooked nicely .
i drove across town to eat here after reading the mostly positive reviews .
the bartender immediately brought me a basket of their rolls with cinnamon butter .
they were also too salty to eat .
it was just salty corn in salty oily liquid .
customer service is lacking .
had the prime rib with sauteed mushrooms and steamed vegetables .
that would require me to come back to eat at your restaurant .
i ended up cleaning with a wet napkin .
not good .
they never get the cook on my wife 's steak right .
no call no credit !
i could hear courtney laughing and they covered the phone .
they are stealing your money !
will never return .
_num_ gals went there for a birthday party .
hot foods were warm .
this store 's manager needs to get there staff in check asap .
then they gave us coupons to come back and sit for free next time .
totally agree with the other reviewers about einstein 's being overpriced .
i so want to like this place .
this store also does n't deliver the bagels to your table .
pick one of those places and buy yourself some bagels .
you have been warned .
second visit w/ my family of _num_ .
not a difficult order and not a busy time .
now i am terrified that more stores exist out there like this one .
go to your local grocery store and buy your own dozen .
avoid !
nasty bathrooms .
a third party booked this room for me for _num_ nights .
my husband and i stayed at this motel for the last three nights .
are you kidding me ?
originally booked a room for _num_ nights here because they were pet friendly .
i was worried about leaving my dog alone in the room let alone myself .
the bathroom clearly had not been cleaned .
nasty .
gross .
however , the beds were comfy .
he listened , looked at all photos .
it 's disgusting !
wrong !
mmmmmm , chicken strips .
wrong again .
not good .
the clam chowder was ok .
no alcohol here .
and no beef selection .
i counted _num_ counters including the drink station .
freakin ' hibachi grill has way more selection .
no chicken enchiladas here .
not good .
they are n't next to the right food .
we were not thrilled .
the food was dry and cold .
more food was out and it was better .
i would not recommend going there .
disappointed .
as we got closer , we discovered it was cheesy mac and cheese .
seriously gross food .
not the best but wanted breakfast and had a coupon for the family .
-the maze is gigantic .
very gross !
this facility does cost more than other competitors in the area .
check prices before you go and see what other facilities are offering .
not cool !
the laser tag itself was pretty decent but everything else wasnt great .
i will not be going back .
this is the second applebee 's that i tried in the last year .
not so .
all of ours were cold .
very poor service .
nothing there that would keep us coming back like before .
ate at the bar on a sunday after work .
no discount .
service was mediocre .
i was not happy .
she gave me my limeade free of charge .
thinking back i do remember having a problem at this location about _num_ yrs .
waited _num_ mins for drinks .
tonight was definitely not their night .
bathrooms are a mess .
service was terrible and slow .
service very slow !
terrible service .
terrible meal .
place is disgusting .
drinks were terrible .
do not recommend this restaurant .
i had the teriyaki chicken , which was pretty good and very flavorful .
the worst !
did not get what we ordered .
i do not recommend to anyone .
my husband and i went there for our first time today .
what a mistake .
too late .
service was horrible !
i order bacon & eggs , wife got the _num_ $ omelet .
my biggest beef the music was ridiculously loud !
they were dry , over done and cold .
i ordered the bagel breakfast , which sounded great , but beware !
so i ordered uni , hamachi , smoked sake ( i know .
ok ; here is my input .
still an `` average '' place for sushi and japanese food .
the prices are slightly on the high side , but not outrageous .
every watch that chef on iron chef ?
at the time it was the highest average rating for sushi in mesa .
we ordered the tuna , yellowtail , tempura , and salmon sushi rolls .
none of us ordered sushi .
my wife was surprised to find the ramen noodles to be spicy .
not very professional .
i usually go by yelp recommendations for new places to eat .
it was only about a few tables busy .
will not go back .
i have eat here many times before , the sushi is very low priced .
only _num_ tables .
everything else i 've eaten recently is stuff i 've had before .
the vegas roll was drenched in soy sauce .
i was very disappointed .
nothing special .
terrible , horrible , awful !
went in for a simple manicure and they damaged my nails beyond repair .
within _num_ days two of my nails snapped and broke into the nail bed .
do n't move in !
i do n't like tomatoes .
the replacement burrito tastes slightly better than the first but not by much .
my burrito was ok.
tables were a mess .
a veggie burrito for example is _num_ calories .
i will not be returning .
it was just okay , but not great .
the person in the bath room was a hispanic baja fresh worker .
they may be conveniently located but there is nothing else convenient about chase .
in all my years , i 'd not experienced it .
could this place be anymore crowded ?
bad business !
bad business !
bad business !
i 'm out another office visit fee only for them to change the estimate .
very unorganized establishment .
ill never take my dog to this location again !
this place is ridiculous .
they were topped with one basil leaf and half of a mini mozzarella ball .
it sucked .
if you go , have the bread and leave !
tonight we dined on pasta and ass .
i went here the other night and it was a fairly not awesome experience .
probably closer to a _num_ star .
it just was n't great .
party of _num_ .
nothing at all .
i was pissed .
there was no apology .
the sale is scheduled to close mid _num_ .
my wife usually gets cold so we thought that would be a great .
what a disappointment !
first of all the place looks somewhat dingy .
it was totally bland .
went here tonight for my sister 's birthday per her request .
drinks were never refilled .
our waiter said she could choose one so she chose the chocolate cake .
went here to eat tonight for dinner .
the olive oil without our bread was the first red flag .
the people sitting at the actual bar were getting better service !
the room was about 1/3 full and we were all being crammed together .
Positive
apps were n't bad .
my side of spaghetti was cold .
my wife ordered some shrimp pasta dish , not alfredo .
once seated our server stopped by very quickly to get drink orders and apps .
the parmesan crusted chicken salad .
that is just inexcusable .
piss poor .
not a chance .
this was rude and ridiculous .
i am done with macaroni grill , as long as everyone in our party .
the fact that they have an opera trained singer on staff .
we were seated immediately , and the waitress was friendly .
it was a sea of black pepper and a few sprinkles of olive oil .
there are probably lots of better italian restaurants in the area that are better .
not a fan of panda express .
portion size very little at this panda .
craving chinese , so we went back to this location today .
same thing happened the last time i was here .
do not eat at this location .
this has been the third time i have been here with the same issues .
go away this is all we have .
let me take a bite ... ... is that ?
waiter : `` well thats our sauce .
me : `` no .
it isnt just tomato .
too bad .
excuse me ?
i will not be going back .
horrible place !
she was so rude !
no big deal .
i have adopted a few dogs before .
she yelled at my daughter to get away from the dog .
that 's not the issue .
my husband and i usually stop at this chilis when we do go .
he walked away relatively quickly but he too was very friendly .
when the drinks arrived , we ordered from the menu .
odd , i thought this was grilled shrimp .
( its _num_ degrees outside today . )
no thank you .
( grilled chipotle shrimp salad ? )
so i sent an email .
my next step is to contact chili 's corporate offices .
that is the _num_ stars for tonight .
not anymore .
my boyfriend & i are regulars at all chilis locations .
anyway , the food is always delish , compliments to the chef .
there was none .
gross !
overall , completely terrible .
never again !
do not eat here .
very poor service .
ordered dinner for _num_ adults and _num_ child .
_num_ star .
very disappointed in chilis .
i ordered catering twice this week at this location .
yesterday , i ordered catering again ( same exact order as before ) .
and the food sucked !
i have been to other locations twice before and each experience was okay .
this restaurant closed down about a year ( or more ) ago .
i stood around for awhile .
so i ended up buying a more expensive model .
does n't office max deal in computers ?
this store is not organized well .
she said they probably were and kept ringing me up .
she said oh yeah , what do you want me to check .
complete waste of time .
i just know i 'm not shopping there again .
i 've never been treated this way at a starbucks .
she did n't even apologized .
i 'm running out of starbucks to go to .
not that impressed .
wo n't be back .
ugh .
so frustrating .
please avoid this place .
paid top dollar for shampoo full interior and wax .
rude ass people !
like who the fuck cares i came here to wash my car .
it 's not closed you just put two cones on the entrance .
this car wash includes the interior and exterior to be cleaned .
he never gave me my money back either !
disappointed !
and they backed off .
he gave me some tips cuz he knows cars and owns a dealership .
oil change guys , not so much !
car is clean outside however the interior not so great .
they ripped us off .
not even worth my time or money .
do not recommend .
disappointed .
they do a better job and they dont talk back .
will not be back .
i ordered oven roasted herb chicken .
not as big as you 'd think , especially for the price .
it 's very dark , too dark for my taste .
overall disappointing .
i ordered the ribeye special .
and it was crap .
with no wine .
i stopped at mcdonalds on the way back to my hotel .
this place sucks .
thing is , the servers make the salads themselves so she clearly just forgot .
ridiculous .
i will not be going back .
poor service .
should n't he be worried ?
draft beers were n't even cold .
ugh .
not impressed one bit .
they seem to be accommodating to the handicapped though .
not so anymore .
too bad .
texas roadhouse beats the pants off of this place hands down .
worst experience ever !
i ca n't quite place what the smell is with them .
very disappointed !
i called up like i usually do and put my order in .
it requires patience .
hot and ready pizza ?
not at this location .
calling ahead does n't help either .
he has problems with the maintenance men here all the time .
hell no !
oh , wait ... .
i am a healthcare traveler and my company put me up in these apartments .
run down , everything is out dated .
nobody picks up after there animals so watch where you step .
plus _num_ dogs !
it 's horrible !
this place is nothing more then a hotel _num_ !
would not recommend them to anyone .
people in this part of town also can not read or count money .
people there are polite , and the customers have a brain .
so i ordered the tacos at $ _num_ each .
when we first walked in , it felt like we were in a sauna .
first time .
my experience was very different .
the service was nothing exceptional .
ordered the cheeseburger and the chili cheese fries with onions .
but my breakfasts made at home kill over what we got .
the staff was as friendly as could be .
it was a sunday , people were chatting .
hot dog , was a standard hot dog on a fresh bun .
i could see the fat being squeezed out of it .
they gave us _num_ bucks back for the shake and apologized .
bacon cheeseburger , fries and coke .
it was the standard burger you eat in your neighbors yard at a bbq .
are the winners in taste , value and price .
fries were lukewarm .
burgers top bun was very hard .
wo n't come back .
service was bad .
went back out and ate what we had ordered and it was alright .
did seem giant too me .
nothing special going on here .
will not be going back ever .
burger was nothing special .
gross .
not worth it .
would not recommend .
$ _num_ no way !
way to much money for that !
it seems like common sense to me .
not a pleasant experience this saturday morning .
this monday i found my car is dripping oil .
they said it cost over _num_ bucks to fix the pan .
no thank you .
i can not believe that .
horrible .
first off , i know my way around a car .
there 's no service .
maybe a return visit on a tuesday in july .
toppings are only done in 1/2 .
frustrating !
the beer and wine is cheap .
i think most people are being very generous to say it 's ok .
very bad pizza .
overall , the place has the ambience of a german beer hall during oktoberfest .
i am thinking people are writing reviews for the atmosphere and not the food .
the food is not good .
why not just collect the full amount when you place an order .
i just returned from a meet up at the organ stop pizza .
the room was crowded .
his entire arm was covered in american flag tattoos .
not kid friendly in menu choices @ drink counter .
the organ is the obvious highlight .
cash only , pricey , leave it for the tourist !
crazy setup , you wait in a line and order your pizza .
peter piper pizza has better food than this place .
not true .
it 's obvious the owners are strictly in business for the money .
when i watch them play , i 'm totally in awe .
starving .
so rude .
made no sense .
ugh .
queens pizza and the waitstaff was awesome .
wait in another line to order your drinks .
tonight was our second and likely final visit to organ stop .
if you are considering using this company , i would recommend using someone else .
i was in the area so i tried out royal cleaners .
went here for the first time because they had the _num_ mens shirt special .
big mistake .
needed _num_ buttons on a shirt .
but they put _num_ different color buttons on the shirt .
this place is horrible !
photos i posted are only a small handful of everything i took pics of .
terrible customer service .
i do not recommend this store .
there is tolerable people there .
during these years i have not seen much improvement on customer service .
zero stars .
i was pissed .
now not one good item !
they do n't even deserve _num_ star !
either way i 'm not returning !
the vet said it was likely from the cleaning fluids .
we left our _num_ dogs here june _num_ .
no problems .
very disrespectful and rude .
i then scheduled the appointment to save $ _num_ .
explained it for about _num_ seconds to my daughter .
terrible terrible terrible .
i hate this place !
they had me come back in and had me fooled they made things right .
just pain terrible .
caution to all food city shoppers at southern and mesa dr !
i 've always purchased ground beef from this location and never had problems .
what a nightmare .
the job obviously still is n't complete _num_ months after the job was done .
i 'm very disappointed .
so now i know why my house has n't been rented in _num_ months .
bad experience .
however , not so much .
i spoke too soon .
he said it was a _num_ dollar job .
avoid at all costs .
imo , denise at todd 's needs a class in customer service .
whatever your bag is , they can make it .
the 1st time i ate here .
the strips were replaced with chicken tasting chicken .
they gave me guacamole in a small paper cup .
for better service at giant burger that is in the same mall .
worst service ever !
worse whataburger yet !
it was unacceptable .
the wait staff there favors the larger groups .
lame fee people .
two thumbs down .
ok , i stopped in with _num_ friends last night .
anyway , she give me back $ _num_ in change .
pathetic .
they just take up room .
Negative
go to oregano 's instead .
so gross .
so , so gross .
awful wings , filthy tables .
overpriced mediocre food ... .
friendly , but painfully slow .
i felt abandoned many times .
have been there to eat _num_ times .
this is so not acceptable .
terrible all around .
boy was i wrong .
this place is gross !
first noticeable thing was the smell .
service was slow .
not helpful or smiley .
- place was disgusting .
not worth it .
he was there sitting as a patron with friends .
we understand rules , but they should apply to everyone .
horrible just horrible .
i was so disappointed .
and then just transferred our call .
disgusting !
you can smell cigarette smoke while waiting to be seated .
not impressed at all .
fries are cheap to make , what 's the issue ?
we walked in , were handed menus and told to seat ourselves .
service was just o.k .
the food is too salty and greasy .
last week was our first visit to native .
how rude and how ridiculous .
worst service .
never going back .
drove out of our way to visit this establishment .
not looking good !
me : um !
girl : why u want me to make it again ?
i am so disappointed .
it drives me crazy when things like this happen often .
this starbucks is somewhat busy but , at mid morning the rush is over .
not very friendly .
someone is trying to save a few dollars each month i guess .
customer service was terrible .
this place is terrible .
... no dice .
my next phone , i will buy online .
trying another store instead .
never very helpful .
overall , i really question verizon in regard to quality and warranty .
think really hard and long before dealing with anything that says verizon .
horrible customer service .
what terrible customer service .
when i arrived , i was greeted with `` just a moment '' .
my daughter was a little bit busy getting married .
boy was i wrong .
i was greeted kindly by the two ladies at night .
went here on a sunday night and the place was a bit crowded .
they try , i 'll give em that .
terrible .
we had the grilled chicken sandwich , pizza , and a burger .
poor service .
my husband and i visited here for lunch today .
she came to take our drink order , _num_ diet , _num_ ice tea .
our drinks were filled and then our order was taken .
she told us the kitchen fell behind with the mad rush of lunch guests .
not this time .
food was ok , service was ok .
burger and fries were cold .
he 'll say they are better than this and ask for another chance .
this place is disgusting .
they never ate at red robin .
there were _num_ of us .
my bill was over $ _num_ .
service horrible .
food even worse .
uncooked vegetables in the soup .
nothing was bottomless .
they comped me for _num_ meals .
are n't they special .
horrible .
horrible experience !
i will not be back .
first off , we wanted _num_ different fries , one regular and one parmesan .
our group of _num_ waited for food and never received some of our food .
i was craving red robin so we stopped here for lunch .
at which point we left & drove through in n out .
not really a fan of this location , maybe not the business at all .
my small _num_ salad became _num_ !
i always buy my daughter gift cards for red robin .
the only pro is the price .
they 're so slow .
absolutely ridiculous .
still no reaction .
Neutral
i walked .
it 's always busy , with never enough cashiers .
terrible .
terrible .
terrible .
cheap prices but it is never an easy in & out at this place .
i wish the staff here cared more .
it 's horrible .
the service is horrific !
ruined my whole day !
this place is awful .
then walmart was about the customer .
for walmart , they have so many items which is a pro and con .
i went to a photo kiosk and requested about _num_ photos .
people are beyond rude .
the pharmacy is slow !
my doctor put in five request for one prescription never got filled .
this is crap .
for the worse .
it 's so gross .
bad customer service .
nasty !
we will not be back .
same quality as subway , just a higher price tag .
will not visit again .
sandwich was mediocre .
the bread reminded me of elementary school lunch .
this one guy behind the kitchen window never smiles .
it was so dry .
instead he was busy trying to open the cash register .
never going back .
disgusting .
i can tell you which neighbors are having relationship problems .
why must i know these things ?
since living here , we have never once received a correct bill .
rent was wrong .
tax was wrong .
despite contacting management , nothing changed .
i have never had an issue with neighbors , residence in my lifetime .
but i suppose i should mention the bowling alley .
`` just throwing it out there , '' he said .
just kidding - you know i love ya , dude .
crappy video game selection .
horrible food .
this was my first time to this particular alley .
the building is plain , late _num_ 's decor .
there are tables and chairs randomly placed through out the building .
lane _num_ occasionally goes completely dark while people are bowling .
they should have closed this one instead .
chicken was tasty .
pretzels were horrible !
there are a couple of distinct reasons to why i give a lower rating .
they raised all of their prices august 1st .
under staffed terrible service .
even the manager , was constantly giving us the stink face .
i 've had many problems with the service at this location .
they also usually take a long time to get my order out to me .
they do n't wear gloves .
disgusting .
huge cheese all over my sandwich .
had half of a sandwich with just egg and bottom biscuit .
thanks bk in _num_ e southern ave , mesa .
this is your typical burger king .
they are never helpful .
however , the way a business deals with a situation is the key .
clearly i would like to tan : ) .
bottom line ... .
terrible .
i switched to beach house tanning on gilbert .
everytime i went , the girls that worked there were great .
she still has n't had any communication with me at all .
i ended up purchasing one and giving it to my mom .
was not able to find shoes .
highly disappointed .
i never go to target because of the prices not being the best value .
i probably would n't stay here again .
worst hotel experience ever .
she did however miss a significant portion .
hate them !
big mistake !
the buyers in this transaction are extremely strong and very low risk .
her name is tammy roberts -- make sure never to use her .
their prices are extremely inflated !
so i went on with my question .
as today is saturday they claimed not to have any deals .
i could never get off hold whenever i called to place an order .
terrible .
very rude !
what i got was pizza swimming in sauce !
terrible delivery service .
he was a little more helpful , helped me get my label printed .
i really think i should apply to work there in their kitchen .
and i was trained by real chinese chefs .
if you are reading this : you need me in your kitchen .
i lived in the far east for years , half my family is chinese .
the chinese say my cooking is better than the restaurants .
there was a sign help wanted in the window , i know why .
he refused .
worst office ever .
rude staff .
very unprofessional and rude people .
very long wait times .
i then tell them it is not a male doctor it 's a female .
in the past two years however , something has changed .
i was staying at the la quinta down the street .
poor , poor customer service .
disappointing .
agent says `` wow you have been a customer for _num_ years '' .
so i bought the junk which ended up being _num_ total .
i needed an exam because my tooth had a small black spot .
a few weeks later a piece of my tooth breaks off .
incompetent idiots .
not laying in a dentist chair with your feet up .
horrible doctor !
it was $ _num_ .
would not recommend .
i would highly recommend him .
my complaint is getting an appointment .
it never fails .
not good .
they clearly do n't care .
do n't go to this office .
still no response .
horrible experience .
i went in to get checked out for an ear infection .
no biggie .
the receptionist said that she would send it over right away .
boy was i wrong !
i will not be going back !
i left another voicemail for her .
less than impressed on my first visit .
said it was much better and would last longer .
i used to shop there frequently .
the prices were competitive and the employees were helpful .
there are a lot of books though , will give you that .
insulting .
rude !
excuse me ?
i will not be back .
you can buy used books for less almost anywhere else .
you can go to any other used bookstore and get a better deal .
it 's way past its prime .
feels more like a walmart .
it 's like she had never done it in her life .
sorry , woman .
so i got the email that it was ready for pick up .
a little understanding and customer service would be nice .
i have only been here _num_ time and that will be it for me .
Negative
i guess my _num_ star will go for the onion rings .
chicken sandwich is a joke .
thumbs down this time .
brandon will never eat there again .
horrible service .
hungry commission driven focused on the sale not the customer .
business must be slow .
this place was horrible .
i really only shop in tools , though that too will soon be changing .
i instead ended up in the electronics .
i arranged for a rental car sunday for monday morning .
i needed a car rental for business frequently but they are not reliable .
and i 'm the only person here .
this is ridiculous .
was craving some wings so thought we 'd catch the game here and indulge .
the staff was friendly and i was given a prompt and thorough estimate .
arizona , late april , _num_ degrees .
no star at all !
the servers , however , are very friendly and helpful .
this has changed however , after visiting this location .
the bacon one of course was a dollar more .
wrong !
Neutral
nice _num_ 's atmosphere albeit noisy .
had breakfast of eggs , ham and `` home fries . ''
service was mediocre .
the mashed potatoes were good , i ate those .
everytime we 've gone our orders are messed up in one way or another .
as i 'm eating i 'm watching the waitresses and hostess make toast .
went before a ball game for a late breakfast .
the food is horrible .
too bad .
no stars !
do n't the owners care ?
just got back from _num_ & diner on southern and where do i begin ?
still will not be back .
will not be back !
making us feel uncomfortable .
shame on you .
this is in regards to fedex store on _num_ s. power rd .
mesa , az _num_ .
save yourself the trouble go somewhere else .
did i mention i was suppose to leave by 5am ?
i sent an e-mail to management .
the suite was very small .
lazy !
i spend several hours with the hotel staff and told me stuff .
i do n't known , if i would stay here again .
no conditioner or lotion ?
probably not .
painfully slow internet !
worst internet ever !
get paper proof that you 've paid if you stay here .
horrible customer service !
my husband purchased _num_ suits .
wrong !
i would never recommend this store .
this second associate answered three phone calls before beginning to ring me out .
just do n't go here .
the staff was friendly , food ok for az .
i will not go back again .
no chairs = boo .
after several months of staying away , we returned to give it another shot .
had the fish tacos and would rate them a _num_ .
i was dining alone so i sat at the bar .
could n't get a beverage refill .
could n't get my check to pay .
this is the first ever that i 've even considered not tipping .
it was simply ridiculous !
onto our food , it seems i can never get what i order .
then i am waiting on my food while the rest of my family eats .
it seems like there is extremely high turn over for patio servers as well .
total rip off !
i tried and it was a tad warmer but not hot .
overall service sucked .
friday night at 7:00 .
every time i go back the portions get smaller .
worst service ever .
he also removed a plate of nachos from the bill .
had dinner tonight and ordered the mango salad .
tonight sealed the deal for me .
steak and chicken was our choice .
whatever you guys have changed ... change it back .
not a good trip .
the chips were stale .
service was soooo slow .
Negative
ok i 'll go _num_ stars .
there were _num_ of us .
i like backyard tacos up on university dr in mesa a whole lot better .
smh , ugh ... .
i had a cheese crisp and chicken tortilla soup .
hell no .
will not be back .
fajitas were like jerky tough and dry .
could never get a refill on my drink either .
i would make own salsa or just eat a little pico for spice .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
nickel and dime me to death .
he 's rude !
neither worked .
she only had them do a routine oil change and a tire rotation !
what a horrible experience .
all services were checked and cleared .
do not use any jiffy lube .
all seemed fine and was in and out quickly .
maintenance is unprofessional .
_num_ carpet deposit ?
when you ask to change the move in date they raise the rent .
fees at this place are outrageous .
nothing is taken care care in a timely manner .
this is your warning .
the breadsticks were not good .
just not good .
the check came out to like $ _num_ .
but not last night .
i recently ate at this olive garden .
disappointing .
it smelt so bad !
just plain lettuce .
the service was terrible .
we were there for two hours because she attended to everyone around us .
she was absolutely terrible .
i am dissapointed in you olive garden .
horrible customer service !
horrible customer service !
horrible !
every time i did i would remember why i wanted to stop .
ugh .
stay away and save your money .
pathetic .
so i went to the mobile counter .
no real reason .
this store needs better organization of computer or better employees .
i do wonder what that is , is that dust or ?
they replaced the medium fries and large fries with _num_ medium fries , problem ?
worst mcdonald 's .
so gross .
complete fail .
no honesty here !
ok i am going to start off by creating the scene for you all .
gross !
stupid service nasty food !
if you like that stuff , then this is the place for you .
i went to the restaurant for the first time .
my sides were rice and green beans .
do not eat at this restaurant .
gross !
this location is crossed off my list .
too much salt !
gross .
really poor attitude .
he could have cared less .
really , really disappointing .
i will not be back !
i ordered the quesadilla explosion salad without the chicken .
disgusting .
your chicken fajitas taste like hot dogs and also have a hot dog consistency .
do you soak the fajita chicken in hot dog water ?
gross .
slow service !
major disappointment .
service was horrible .
so i payed it forward by not leaving a tip .
horrible experience !
sorry excuse for a restaurant .
very poor service .
once the food was brought out there some errors in what we ordered .
i guess my spanish is rusty , but i thought queso is cheese .
very disappointed .
his practice is little more than a procedure mill .
proceed at your own risk .
that 's bad business .
i do n't get it .
for future customers , stop suggesting after they have acknowledged your ideas !
no warranty covers .
going to channel _num_ , this is just the beginning !
the 1st time they replaced my bed right away .
when i ask for call backs from managers it never happens .
once they have your cash that is it folks !
called supervisor to get more info .
terrible customer service .
i had them leave it in my garage and signed for it .
and the prices were extremely high for that low grade quality .
but according to other jewelers it most def it .
i purchased the two tires and they were installed on the back .
my car was driven directly to my home and stayed there .
it was one of the news tire that i had just purchased .
they are not helpful .
horrible horrible wait time .
i 'm still here waiting btw .
still has n't been fixed .
this is getting ridiculous .
do n't believe the hype .
that 's asking too much .
the music on the speakers kept cutting out and was driving me nuts !
fix it or turn it off .
i ate my messy sub and left as soon as i could !
so , we went to get charcoal and used the smaller pool .
their apartment will be inspected once a month for a year .
i 'm currently looking for a new apartment .
so , just know this is what 's happening at this place .
if your a non smoker , it could also be a selling point .
someone stole gas out of our truck while it sat in the parking lot .
that cost me nothing .
the second surgery really hurt .
that 's not cool .
i am extremely angry .
the interior is just like any other strip mall restaurant .
i 'm not even lying .
next i tried the kalua pork .
the cashier later refunded my order .
it was just disgusting .
the cashier later refunded my order .
it was just disgusting .
horrible .
i ordered the teriyaki chicken with macaroni salad .
prices have been increased and portions reduced .
ripoff !
teriyaki chicken , mahi mahi and coconut shrimp .
i can still smell the fish odor on my clothes .
i 'm glad i was on my way home for the day .
enough on that , i 'm getting upset again just typing it .
my better half got the chicken katsu & it was just alright .
was that too harsh ?
not the best hawaiian food i have had .

that she might have one zip off skirt dress .
this place sucked .
plain and simple .
jamie , our waiter , was awesome .
seriously poor service !
seriously poor service !

the turkey dinner .
gross !
sole is a tender fish and does n't need much cooking .
and way not worth it .

no pool !
my balcony off the room overlooked the us _num_ - not to impressive .
staff is approachable , not extremely helpful .
internet service was poor .

lame corporate no class hilton .
noisy .
noisy .

the service was n't very good .
crew were having fairly loud personal conversations .
very slow service .
but the dirt wont come off !
wrong .
gross .

she explained that she would pay for the extra child .
the hostess put him on my guest list anyway .
she was apparently busy with the several other parties that were there .
no kidding .

they hand me the bumper in the exact condition i dropped it off .
unbelievable .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
worst customer service ever !
boy was i wrong !
but we gave a benefit of a doubt because it is very cheap .
utterly awful .
my meal here turned out to be a very odd experience .
this i 'm not used to .
someone else would have left .
sink was dirty .
had cigarette burns on tv bedside table and blanket on bed .
only had one wash cloth two towels and two hand towels .
they gave us hand towels to wash with .
bed too close to wall .
it has not improved .
cheaper but not worth it .
treating the customer horribly .
said only deal with companies .
careless !
worst possible experience ever .
why why why .
horrible customer service .
make sure to get the total in writing and signed by the manager !

there are way better sandwhich shops with actual homemade sides for half the money .
they wont even come out to look at it .
do not use this place !
it looks horrible !
just trying to sell stuff .
_num_ stars for amount of supplies they carry .
absolutely ridiculous .
i like carl 's jr , that 's why i 'm giving two stars .
once inside the store it is well stocked but very small and narrow .
so much for less desirable location meaning cost savings for me .
but customer service goes a long way with me .
terrible service .
i knew the dress needed to be taken in at the bust and shoulders .
i was quoted $ _num_ !
$ _num_ for very minor alterations .
the all quoted me between $ _num_ - $ _num_ .
disappointing .
it was so nasty !
i was seriously disappointed .
i was grabbing breakfast for me .
mixed crowd , pitchers of beer , oh , and some serious cigarette smoke .

well i was wrong .
yes it was technically deep dish but not chicago style .
he gave us a stack of cocktail napkins .

total bummer , another one bites the dust .
we went tonight because i had an offer for a free birthday pizza .
they were clearly `` warmed '' over in the microwave .

worst experience ever .
during the _num_ days i was in that room it was never vacuumed .
during the remaining _num_ days of my stay , the room was never vacuumed .
the staff dresses and acts like they work for a 2nd rate motor lodge .
the room i stayed in was anything but renovated .
there was an open hotel soap , still wet , on the counter .

the pizza never got here - ordered hours ago .
no pizza .
ridiculous .
dominos sucks .
thanks for nothing .
why _num_ star ?
this dominos can not include sauces that they charge for .
no marinara sauce !
frustrating & funny .
ive had cafeteria pizza back in the 70s better than this .
the canadian bacon was like plastic and the pepperoni was like jerky .
simply appalling service .
disgusting .
that toppings being pineapple , mushrooms , jalapeo , and pepperoni .
we ordered stuffed crust with marinara sauce .
the pizza was just dough in the middle .
i would highly advise not bringing your car here .
they also threatened not to give her car back .
how rude .
after giving these guys multiple chances , it 's over for me .
if it was up to me they would get _num_ stars !
no stars !

hello that is not the customers problem .

we left there disappointed .
so with that being said , _num_ stars .
not good .
thankfully , we have ono hawaiian bbq in town .
drab location in an unassuming strip mall .
we had teriyaki chicken , katsu , and fish .
the fish tasted like egg .
the salad was a store bought bagged salad with thousand island dressing .
so i ended up with a mini order of chicken katsu to go .
the potato - mac salad is indeed flavorful and addicting .
chicken was crispy from the outside and juicy inside .
i am glad i read the reviews to prepare me for my experience .
so i said , `` hello , were you waiting for us ? ''
it is tasteless .
ate here today and had combo # _num_ .
it was terrible .
there was confusion about their menu .
the online menu in yelp is n't overly accurate , by the way .
the chicken katsu was decent .
disgusting .
i do n't get it .
no thanks .
i got the spinach , mushroom and bacon omelet .
waiter was not attentive .
not so !
we had _num_ bowls of soup and blackberry bread pudding .

i mean , come on ... take an accurate order .
i found a hair ball in my half bucket of hot wings .

the service is slow .

my daughter ordered chicken that looked good but was raw inside .
the shrimp pupusas was my fave amongst beef and pork .

horrible costumer service .
the empanadas were so hard you could have seriously hurt someone with them .

the following morning i had emergency surgery to save my son .
it was the generic computer voice .
every phone i used reached my phone .
ridiculous .
horrible customer service !
i 'm making sure everyone knows how i feel about this credit union .
( _num_ th and camelback ) .
it will save lots of money and hassle .
_num_ .
inconsistent delivery .
_num_ .
_num_ .
terrible , terrible experience !
awful customer service .
the check was short .
it is not much money but its the fucking principle of the matter .
none have been able to provide lasting solutions .
i 'm always tempted to take videos to post on you tube .
i also filed a police report and i contacted the coupon people .
awful awful company
( seriously ?

: / not the best starbucks experience i 've had .
rude and annoyed .
can i also get a pumpkin muffin ? ''
it made me uncomfortable .
should be zero stars .
just reminded me why i do n't shop safeway or go to starbucks .
avoid avoid avoid .
weather you 're drive through or going inside .
they completely ignore your order and you actually have to inquire about it .
what disappointing service !
mediocre .
wonton soup as best thing i had .
walk in around lunch time and was greeted and seated right away .
my boyfriend ordered the orange chicken and i got the sweet and sour chicken .
also the lights are so dim in there that its hard to see .
this place is a joke !
went back several months later with my girlfriend again !
i figured i had to write something .
this is the only chinese restaurant in the area .
also , there staff are not talkative or friendly .
a _num_ star rating for `` meh .
just was ... unremarkable .
i 'll probably try it again , just wish i 'd been blown away .
zero stars .
food- no taste .
too much batter on the honey chicken .
tasteless egg roll .
even if they want cheap .
is cheap .
i stopped in here for carryout the other night for the first time .
the tso chicken was extremely breaded .
it appears they use dark meat for it and not white breast .
prices to me were on the higher side for the portion size and quality .
will not go back .
what airport greasy spoon restaurant is closed on sunday morning ?
_num_ ) finally , they got the auto refill up and running .

the decor has not changed since the place was built .
)
)
do not bother .

salad is not included in the more expensive meals .
alas it is not .
not a lot to say here .

Positive
serrano 's has better food for much less money .
nothing to get excited about .
( unlike many other places in aj ) .
i was n't that impressed .
the food was just okay ... i 've had better .
not a fan .
i ordered a ground beef taco that had an abundance of onions in it .
too bad .
on the menu , it states they are grilled vegetable quesadillas .
i like the patio with the water feature out back .
my wife really likes the camarones baja ( sauteed shrimp ) .
was a chef mistake .
and the vegetables were oily too .
nothing here to write home about .
the service usually stinks .
salsa was bland .
no heat .
no flavor .
guac was incredibly bland .
the burrito was just veggies folded into a burrito .
just gross .
our bill was $ _num_ .
all in all , not a great experience .
the place was clearly understaffed .
taco salad very dry .
spinach enchilada was tasteless .
very disappointing .
long wait to be seated .
this is the first time we have tried this restaurant .
the service was slow .
atmosphere was loud and crowded seats together .
was n't very clean .
not much food for the price .
if the kitchen is too hot then get out .
_num_ ) return visit ?
are you kidding never !
the food was n't good either .
horrible experience .
awful awful service .
this was terrible !
they advertise the burger is _num_ % real beef .

the margarita was your basic amateur margarita .
why were your employees dining where the guest eat ?
service was bad .
it still had _num_ taste .
_num_ more min .
no taste of seasoning whatsoever .
again , another review , another update .
but owners needs to put this lady in charge .

place was over lit and quite tacky .
sat forever waiting for a server had to go get my own menus .
bad attitude !
crappy service .
bus boy was better than the wait staff .
not worth the money spent .
do not pay with a cc .
before we were approached with chips and salsa .
another _num_ min .
sat for another _num_ min .
please do n't let this great establishment go to the dogs .
we are currently searching for a new favorite mexican food restaurant .
i am officially bummed .
something was n't right .
they also serve cold beers .

it comes with bottled salsa again not freshly made as you would also expect .
the food is sub-par .
went there for lunch on monday .
food was lousy .
will not be back .
taco bell was better .
the service was terrible .
rushed .
worst mexican restaurant ever !
no excuses for this today !
i 've been to this place three times .
horrible .
the french toast was completely amateur .
it 's like the french toast your _num_ year cousin would make .
would not recommend and will not be returning .
the food is only so-so .
_num_ other larger groups seat behind me .
but for $ _num_ soup & entree , you get what you pay for .
i do n't need to go back .
now we generally always get the orange chicken combos .
food cold , rice cold , could n't eat it .
store # _num_ in apache junction .

wrong effing burrito !
meal ... ruined .
horrible experience !

first of all , it 's a desert course .
second , the layout is dangerous , especially on the back nine .
this is bad business .
ick .
Negative
i 've ate here _num_ times now , mainly because i can walk here .
i am a hard worker and my time is precious .
have not ate yet .
the waitress was very polite and kept apologizing .
it was gross .
husband picked up dinner from here tonight .
they never put actual cherries in a cherry vanilla coke .
it was still wrong .
stupid people work here !
problem is , we had already paid .
this was so wrong .
shame on you sonic !
and that is not a good thing .
$ _num_ for both including tax !
this most recent was tonight .
what i can say is it was a bit small for the price .
my mom and dad ordered the fish and i got the cobb salad .
the fork that they gave me had dried food on it .
really disgusting and quite gross .
with the very long wait i feel i am being generous with a _num_ .
however , this last trip might have changed that for me .
complete waste of time .
the windows are gross .
they should be embarrassed .
one was wrong .
the service was completely shitty , but the rooms were impeccably clean .
so to sum up , clean , pretty inexpensive , shitty staff .
it could be worse .
however , most of them are affordable at only $ _num_ each .
that was a little cute , but a really short act .
not worth time , money or energy .
a tourist trap that will `` nickel and dime '' you to death .
horrible experience here .
biggest waste of time .
sit back , grab a cup of coffee and read on .
always , looks and acts half asleep .
this is a total tourist trap sitting on top of an old gold mine .
after the train ride , we went to the saloon for lunch .
do n't look to closely at the decorations on the wall , very dusty .
going through the drive-thru has n't been the best .
your waiting and waiting , watching car after car .
do they think i 'm sitting here for my health ?
rude !
lame !
yelp kinda let me down on this one .
it was really greasy and not all that satisfying .
_num_ stars ?
no way , jose .
the wait was ridiculous !
ate at the dirt water last night .
highly not recommended .
$ _num_ .
if you want loud , ask for lindsay she will be sure to please !
the food is just not good .
i do not recommend .
not so much .
we will be removing this place from our list of places to eat .
bad idea .
food was not good .
salsa is tomato sauce .
not good for liver .
skip this place .
the gravy is out of a bottle .
the only entre that was good was the hamburger our 4th person ordered .
it 's only scrambled eggs and potatoes !
i guess that 's why they 're so affordable .
next time , we 'll stick with the farm .
we were very disappointed .
tired .
are all stores not on the same page ?
order totally wrong .
not going back .
went here march _num_ , _num_ .
the club is kinda small .
_num_ stage .
luckily i had his wallet though .
very laid back hole in the wall club with a good bar .
gross .
prices on ammo suck .
just my _num_ cents .
i came after a suggestion from walgreens that it was cheaper and easier there .
this was not true .
this is ridiculous !
they could do much better !
Negative
my guy had sections all over him that were left longer than the rest .
they may have been nice _num_ months ago but they sure are n't now !
so anyone i know with a trans .
i was wrong .
i ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza .
would not recommend .
horrible overall .
it probably was to confusing for the cashier .
monday - friday 11am to 3pm .
waste of my time .
an employee was smoking outside the door as i entered .
not coming here again .
i dunno .
big mistake .
the eggs were cold .
not warm , but cold .
almost walked out !
maybe if you add corn or just start using jiffy mix they would improve .
my oven fried chicken was pretty good - ill give them that .
service was just awful !
the wait staff is n't exceptional , but , try to keep up .
!
but this was utterly abysmal .
very slow !
there was minimal customer service .
we are not likely to return .
Negative
dean is a little kid with braces trying to do a big boy job .
i would .
this place is terrible .
everyone is rude .
we walked in to see what we could get for a trade in .
a few hours of waiting later i got may car back .
the park has full hook ups and cable tv .
the weather in february ca n't be beat .
we give you _num_ % off . ''
i wonder how many bugs we ate .
_num_ % ?
absolutely gross ?
i think it is highly overrated .
the same thing goes for the general chicken .
i probably will not be back .
most casa grande restaurants need a good cleaning .
our room has wallpaper peeling everywhere .
would not stay again .
it was an ok stay .
stayed at several hotels in the casa grande before .
the beer selection is very basic .
food was overcooked .
food was bad .
that was completely obnoxious .
maybe the cleaning staff ordered the movie ?
not so good .
i personally do n't like their breakfast buffet .
their buffet is more like a sit down restaurant .
_num_ ) the dryer does n't dry clothes .
housekeeping needs to do a better job .
my car and this point had only been worked on at the dealer .
the person that helped me was entirely too interested in my car .
my car went up on the lift and sat .
wrong !
_num_ minutes later flat .
ok flat bed tow .
_num_ miles away , casa grande pep boys .
new tires are flat .
chose the cactus , it will hurt less .
there are homeless everywhere asking for change or sitting in the corner .
most horrible service ever !
not just a _num_ time thing .
people are rude .
horrible service .
wrong !
would not take it back .
terrible `` customer service !
the atmosphere is low key .
horrible pet care .
it 's not just about money !
poor customer service .
most horrible customer service .
everyone else was horrible .
if u want a good pizza , do n't order delivery from this place !
- vacuuming was not effective .
they are probably vacuuming but it is n't picking anything up .
do not stay here .
rude manager .
the room smelled of a mixture of pee and smoke ( non-smoking rooms ?
dirty dirty dirty !
gross !
gross period .
will not be back .
beware : do not stay here !
do not go they have bed bugs .
i have not ate here since they took out the grilled stuffed nacho .
skip this place .
_num_ weeks ago i was in tucson and got a way nicer blizzard !
nothing special .
the food was only average .
was beyond condescending and arrogant .
very very rude !
however , in this tourist area it was a surprise .
this does not even deserve a star .
how rude .
often the little hole in the wall restaurants have some of the best food .
that is not the case here .
that does n't smell funny .
my husband got a regular chicken burrito .
i 've eaten better hospital food .
horrible customer service .
rotten hair cut .
i ended up having him take the whole thing down to skin .
wo n't be back .
just no .
so gross .
so tacky .
i dunno , never been back never plan to .
this is a bar , not a family restaurant by any means .
hour and half wait time for oil change and tire rotation .
your loss walmart .
however , security was super nice .
ridiculous !
( no longer ! )
avoid !
chips and salsa to start ... i 've honestly had better salsa from target .
every taco my irish mother has ever made was better than this one .
when you order a chicken burrito , thats really all you get .
it 's a rolled up tortilla with subpar chicken in it .
where 's the sour cream ?
at least it 'll be cheap .
beans are delish , tho .
the food is really not good .
do n't bother .
chips no salsa .
the cheese crisp came cold .
very disappointed .
also , you can not discount the friendly , warm and welcoming atmosphere .
there is nothing exotic on their menu .
if you want sour cream , you must order and pay for it .
if you consider taco bell mexican , this is the place for you .
so not the best .
i ordered the plate with the _num_ tacos , and either rice or beans .
i left this dump .
the salsa is basically water , ketchup and chili powder .
i 've visited many of them in phoenix , tucson , and casa grande .
no guacamole means no guacamole .
i was simply amazed .
fail , francisco grande .
the walls are thin - i could hear my neighbor on the phone .
so the bar is cheap .
and not just in a good way .
alot more than was delivered here .
the pizza was typical pizza chain fair .
do not eat here .
i was thrilled to see a sit down pizza hut in casa grande .
_num_ hour delivery times ?
i call this pizza butt .
worst service ever !
it 's like they hate their lives .
my wife 's quesadilla was drenched in oil ... .
menu never changes though .
can get boring .
i went during the week at lunch with my son to have the buffet .
my husband and i ate here today for the first time .
my husband used the mens room right before leaving and said it was deplorable .
this place is disgusting !
the service was horrible .
very disappointed .
was essentially reheated shredded chicken cooked with a few onions .
also disappointing .
we will not be back .
excuse me ?
it was disgusting !
it was clear that this was a problem from the bottom to the top .
i am very disappointed .
as if i would consider going back at that point .
lost my business !
the carpet had like , palm trees .
this person tried cleaning it again a few more times .
the worst experience ever !
horrible customer service !
lol ) pretty disgusting .
dress it up a little .
put something else on there beside the steak and potato .
it was very disappointing .
me too .
garlic mashed potatoes sucked .
suppose to have lettuce , tomato , onion , pickle and mustard .
called outback and manager gave a comp for a burger .
my wife was shopping nearby so i thought it would be convenient .
i am so done with outback steakhouse .
so angry !
sadly , chandler blows .
we 're not all rich .
food did not impress me .
i would not recommend this location .
ok , time to drive there & get gas on the way .
not so brilliant hostess says your wait time was cut in half !
i have never in all my visits experienced cold bread at outback .
anyway we ordered the blooming onion that my wife had been craving .
it is typical chain food .
so slow .
dont sit and wait for your food .
but last night we decided to go in for dinner and drinks .
blooming onion was burnt .
pasta with shrimp was so dry .
the only item that was actually good was the french onion soup .
the rib-eye was very tough , as were the kids steak bites .
started off bad .
they are advertising free upgrades on the size of the outback sirloin .
server knew nothing about it .
jen 's steak was over cooked .
$ _num_ was our total .
i strongly advise being careful to all who are currently renting .
on the surface , that 's exactly what we thought we were getting .
nope , never happened .
their laundry is _num_ % cheaper and _num_ % better !
i tried their pizza on different occasions , different toppings but ... .
i just do n't like it .
we ordered a garden salad to share amongst our table and a specialty pizza .
overall , i was underwhelmed .
she was not so pleasant .
i got the chicken panini and the bf got the meatball parm .
my sandwich was ridiculous .
it was almost bitter in my mouth .
we showed up with our _num_ month old daughter .
will lose business over this even though the food is great .
we ate here for the first time this evening !
our order would of literally of been $ _num_ , oh well .
the thing is , it ai n't all that great .
this is not pizza !
there is much much better out there .
there was probably another three small parties dining while we were there .
we were politely greeted and seated timely and our server daniel was nice .
we ordered a large mushroom pizza with vegan cheese and a second to-go .
a large pizza with _num_ chopped up mushroom on the pizza .
alas , that has not been the case .
i did n't even want to give one star .
i felt so bad !
that place is nothing out of the ordinary .
guess its time for a new weekly lunch spot .
we were terribly disappointed .
my _num_ year old had the kids meal which included an ice cream scoop .
there are many more places out there with better pizza .
you served raw dough pizza .
not much service checking throughout the meal , we got our own drink refills .
tonight was definitely the last i 'll ever order here .
truly disappointing .
received two containers of ranch dressing that were less than 1/4 full .
just lost a customer .
the manager said they would discount the order and send me a gift certificate .
!
very disappointed ... ... .
and , i have only been in az for two years .
when i say i am serious about my pizza ... believe me .
but , mcdowell is by work , and i live in ahwatukee .
it was empty !
there were five employees behind the counter , all facing the kitchen line .
i have him my name and paid for my food .
this nypd location is where customer service goes to die .
this place reminds of wong 's palace in tempe but not as good .
for some reason , the food just does n't hit the spot .
the folks at my work would order this food quite often .
and our vegetable chow mein was a bowl of soupy vegetables .
and handed me my receipt .
the moo shu tasted very sour .
worst customer service ever !
disgusting .
for starters , it 's the least you can do .
so just out of principle , i think the whole order should be refunded .
twice i had to explain the concept of leftovers to her .
why yes , of course i did .
my girlfriend almost had a heart attack when she saw that .
terrible .
if your looking for all around i would suggest to look at someone else .
i had a craving for pasta so i stopped by .
i was greatly disappointed !
maybe their pizza is better , but i wont go back .
most of the food tastes like reheated frozen food .
actually , i 've had better frozen italian from the grocery store .
big portions of ill tasting food , and not cheap either .
huge mess !
awful , horrible experience !
this is not a winner .
service is extremely slow .
mediocre at best .
we do not recommend .
after almost an hour , we finally received a cheese pizza and baked pasta .
gross .
$ _num_ for a pedi .
they were busy ... too busy for my taste .
not a relaxing environment at all .
my pedi ... eh .
this place gets loud when its busy .
the sign on their window states `` $ _num_ pedicure '' .
seriously , what is that ?
this place is gross .
number one rule of salons , sanitation !
so i went back to have it fixed .
polish is too thick .
my polish is already peeling up and it 's only been a week .
they are rude !
god only knows how clean their pedicure bowls and mani/pedi equipment are .
this place is super crammed too .
god only knows how clean their pedicure bowls and mani/pedi equipment are .
this place is super crammed too .
rude and filthy !
did they rub it off the skin ?
the design looks like a _num_ year old did it .
will not be going back .
gross !
this place is horrible .
offered no apologies .
which by the way was cluttered , not the cleanest and crowded .
i got an older lady and she started taking my polish off .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
good thing i didnt have an event tonight and had to wear heels .
horrible service !
i found it horribly rude .
it is not that complicated .
i was unfortunately very disappointed .
there hours on the door state they are open till 7pm .
been coming here for years .
the line was very long and i was on a quick break from work .
_num_ tellers only , on a friday !
i hope they know how to respect their customers .
do not go to this branch .
what a shame !
i saw at least _num_ people walk out without any food at all .
rick w is correct ; dr .
dr fish is an ok oral surgeon .
however , his financial practices are shady .
this place is horrible !
if your not rich then your treated less !
i do not recommend !
ridiculous !
avoid this place !
annoying !
_num_ minutes .
location is alright cuz it 's near ultra .
product selection is alright too .
i 'm thinking they need a couple more cashiers on the weekend .
a week before christmas and they have _num_ cashier working ?
this location is consistently under staffed and looks like a bomb went off .
and walked off .
took me three employees to get them adjusted properly .
they stick out of the frame , nearly into my eyebrow .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they provide you with a lens case , where you select 4-5 frames .
_num_ .
_num_ .
insurance plan only covers the cheap lenses .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
be prepared to walk away .
poor customer service .
not friendly .
the guy was helpful , but not the tall girl .
i 've done business with batteries plus for years .
i said oh , then it really is n't holding any juice .
i politely said thank you and i would be i .
turned out i could have bought it at petsmart for considerably less money .
we will not be going back .
we brought our _num_ mo old puppy here for a hurt leg .
would not recommend this place .
i looked at the invoice and was stunned .
the medication charge was outrageous !
as far as the visit itself , it was average .
wrong !
it is $ _num_ !
terrible terrible terrible horrible customer service !
then the worst part .
go out to my car and print some money out ?
thanks for nothing .
they just want your money .
first thing monday morning we took him to our vet .
first thing monday morning we took him to our vet .
do not go to this place .
went on saturday night , on my way home from work .
this location is horrible .
give del taco over on ray & dobson your business instead of this place !
this particular one , however , is at the bottom of my list .
ugh .
i hate you taco bell .
the package has not been received until now ( feb _num_ ) .
most expensive is $ _num_ .
terrible !
car was still dirty .
it 's ridiculous .
never , ever , ever again .
it was a noisy zoo .
lot 's of partner switching -- in fact switching is almost all we did .
when i responded , he told me to stop talking .
i wish i had n't .
gross .
sign # _num_ that i should grab my kids and run .
do n't get that .
however my past two visits had errors though .
fries rather than onion rings last time , despite being clear .
i dont think that i want to risk another visit there again .
but i find that typical of a lot of dental offices these days .
this place is nearby so i use it on occasion .
and service is not so good .
the groupon covered $ _num_ of the service .
it was a hard , hard sell .
never going back .
ill stick to do it yourself places .
i sincerely pity anyone who comes here looking for a good experience .
i was then rushed from the premises .
do not go to this place !
terrible customer service !
wrong .
then come back to get my car washed .
i get my car washed here a lot never a problem !
not impressed .
very disappointed !
not even for car washes .
unfortunately , he lied .
also , extra pushy windshield guy , so be prepared for that .
finally , do n't be in a rush .
i 'll stick to cobblestone auto spa .
i find this unacceptable .
i was once a loyal customer here .
really bad service here .
this is my lunch .
not me .
no apology when went back ?
very disappointed .
worst service ever !
i expressed to him that time efficiency is my number _num_ priority .
ruined that manicure .
_num_ .
your solution is to have me go back for another two washes ?
so i have more things taken ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
i decided to try this since it was a full service wash .
i settled on a wash , vacuum and clean the interior window .
i went inside to wait for my car .
Positive
no thanks !
i feel management needs to train their staff better .
it was very convenient to where i used to live .
they are n't big on being friendly , at least not consistently .
the weights are the same but there is more room at the other location .
it 's cheap , if that 's all you care about .
so , customer service ?
i 'd hate working here , too .
gross .
this just goes to show the kind of people that come here , too .
no one cares .
no answering machine .
no dice .
i then insisted on being connected with the operations manager .
not so fast .
i spoke with christine , a manager of member services .
but ... but ... try complaining about a piece of equipment .
an obvious safety concern .
some of their equipment is busted and needs pads replaced , etc .
staff : hit and miss , mostly miss .
dude , mexican food is my shit !
i maintained that membership until _num_ because it was inexpensive .
basketball court is a serious safety hazard .
yes it 's a gym but class is required in any establishment .
never take up training sessions here .
in _num_ , companies should be providing a lot better customer service .
never even tried to fix it .
absolute fail .
ok , i used to come here all the time .
f this establishment and the idiot that answered the phone .
horrible customer service .
nothing special .
$ _num_ each ?
service was very poor .
my water never got refilled despite his two promises to fill it .
for _num_ chicken tenders ? )
food was not very good .
however , they really need to do something about their booth seats .
my _num_ year old saved and saved to buy his 1st aquarium .
are you kidding me ?
she finally listened to what i wanted for my dog .
the grounds look terrible .
but it is n't .
worst .
Very negative
worst management ever .
this place does n't even deserve one star .
terrible .
just terrible .
every time we have gone there we have seen someone different .
it 's very impersonal .
we tell them , not today we have a plan for our bills .
the visits before the one with the doctor were just okay .
not just that but all they do is bark orders at you .
such poor patient care !
she took me back into the exam room and did the routine things .
Neutral
i will not be returning .
ridiculous .
do not support this business .
very sad .
downhill since then .
this was my last visit .
engine .
not going there again .
my time is worth more then $ _num_ jiffy lube .
not recommended for anyone !
i might try the chorizo or the carne asada next time .
just your standard , run of the mill `` mexican '' food .
nothing special here .
maybe try a burrito instead ?
one word : disappointing .
personally , i used to come here a lot more often than i do .
the guacamole was a bit thinner than i like .
however , on my last visit , i waited a bit longer than normal .
i should have just asked for my money back .
i 'm really disappointed .
its nothing special .
the place was clean and the staff was friendly .
service stinks here !
seriously , rice and beans are a staple .
service .
have to wait for her to come back and ask for my cup again .
bland food .
the beef taco is shredded beef , which was good ( to me ) .
look , i get that it 's a cheap fast food style restaurant .
truly bad form .
not pleasurable at all .
however , last sunday i placed a phone order .
very poor poor customer service !
waste of money .
rip off .
bad service .
the mexican food there is ok .
trust me , there are tons of better apartments out there so keep looking .
the worst customer service .
i walked in ready to buy a pair of glasses .
so i walked out .
Neutral
i had my eyes checked and made my husband an appointment .
month to get me my glasses and sunglasses that i bought for myself .
horrible customer service .
absolute worst experience !
within _num_ hours , i had three major chips .
made my appointment for _num_ pm on thursday .
anyhow , women beware !
the atmosphere is ok if you sit by the water .
and he did - and multiple times .
food comes , there 's the friggin ' rice all over my plate .
not recommended whatsoever !
some burros is _num_ times tastier & it 's fast food !
not cool .
i could n't handle it .
we 've been going to valle luna on and off for years .
the last time that we ate there , we were less than pleased .
the rice was blah .
bland bland bland !
gordon ramsey really needs to make a visit to this place .
they have awesome salsa but not awesome chips .
ugh .
two , the food is definitely not the best mexican in the area .
bad luck maybe .
the fish tacos apparently were okay .
so next time i suppose i should try that instead of the chicken tacos .
not a fresh item to be had .
rice was tasteless and horribly mushy .
drinking water cause they got the pepsi .
really you serve mexican food with cheese that is n't melted ?
this is a place in need of a visit from restaurant impossible .
_num_ weeks passed and i decided to follow up on it .
alright valle luna i feel like it is finally time to speak out .
this had to be why your restaurant was given a b rating .
i 'm not just talking every once in a while .
this is completely unacceptable .
this is an every time thing not just every once in a while .
total charge would have been _num_ .
waiter ( diego ) comped it , thankfully .
had a party for _num_ today at lunch .
this place was awful !
longer for drinks to be delivered .
we will not be back .
horrible service .
i was never contacted by management .
in january they doubled their prices and stopped the bean dip .
so sad .
horrible customer service .
been going to valle luna literally for years .
gross !
huge disappoint .
my boyfriend introduced me and my girls to this place _num_ years ago .
six of us sat down to dine and we went to order .
no substitutions !
all this for _num_ + dollars .
not very impressed .
they had attitude as well .
not tonight .
i went for dinner after not having visited for over a year .
they stopped giving bean dip with the chips .
very sad .
fool me once ... .
it was late so we sat in the bar area .
big mistake !
_num_ lost customers .
their food is mediocre .
the corn taco shells have been shiny with grease on the last 3-4 visits .
total bummer and disappointment .
what happened ?
no way .
rude , rude , rude .
the clerk today was put out by my business .
my first visit to boston market in probably 10+ year .
sadly the tea was nasty .
ugh .
it 's not inviting at all .
then i arrive home and give my husband the cookie he wanted .
nasty !
i have n't been here in almost _num_ yrs .
she is going through the same thing i did .
confused ?
she also mentioned that the manager would be calling me that day .
after the sitting and review of the pictures came the sticker shock .
worst pedicure ever .
the pedi however is where things really head south .
but would not rub my feet .
thats the part that hurts after being on them all day !
weird weird weird .
called and made an appointment for _num_ people .
will not be back here .
never again will i return .
i tried this place twice for manicures .
completely gross !
i 'm sorry .
it always takes 5-10 seconds at most !
it does not have to .
just stop it .
nothing more and nothing less .
i have done it a thousand times before .
hubby and i met a couple of friends here for dinner tonight .
well , disappointing .
it 's not authentic and it 's chinese style trust me !
do n't go to this restaurant .
went in for lunch and it was moderately busy .
bad idea !
we went here after purchasing a groupon .
the service was so strange .
i ordered veggie pho and substituted the noodles for extra vegetables .
my boyfriend ordered pho thai .
but veggie pho is a hit or miss ... .
unacceptable .
i could tell that they were trying to get rid of us .
the other server gave our check even though we were still eating .
later , i see a server putting a shaved ice desert on our table .
rude server was upset .
i could tell that they were trying to get rid of us .
the other server gave our check even though we were still eating .
later , i see a server putting a shaved ice desert on our table .
rude server was upset .
the server taking our order was distracted the whole time while taking our order .
the service was bad .
mmmmm , not my idea of clean .
terrible service !
waited _num_ mins for food .
it was ridiculous !
it was horrible service !
another thing , they are not kid friendly .
in conclusion , i would eat there again , but only carry out .
service was soooooo slow .
too much msg !
had another bad service .
wo n't be returning .
i 'm vietnamese , so i know damn well what it should be like .
i cant even explain .
i do not recommend .
went thru the drive through recently and asked for a jr frosty .
so she told me my total .
no flavor at all !
the window opened again i was handed my bag once again window just shut .
seems to be the same situation every time i go .
guess that is the only way you get your money 's worth .
i do n't ever see any staff around except at checkout .
`` , would suffice .
worst wax ever !
so since that was my only option , i had to do that .
all three employees were chatting behind the counter .
i sure do miss my camelback location !
which is such a lie because i went with her .
i went to the ulta salon to get a color and cut .
it seems like they hate their job .
reason why i prefer to go to sephora !
just terrible overall .
when buying gifts for people i will be probably looking else where than ulta .
floral arrangements are not delivered as they appear online .
salon is hit or miss depending on who does your nails .
they are cheap but you get what you pay for .
the price was very comparable to walk in nail salons in the area .
would not recommend this place .
figured it was n't worth arguing over paid and left .
will not go back and will not recommend .
the talent of this jeweler is obvious .
shopped there so much i even bought stock in the company .
this place is awful .
worst shopping experience ever !
do you not require any sort of training before you hire these people ?
Negative
finally , she said , ready in _num_ hours .
yup -- _num_ .
i 'm going to try the walgreens on chandler blvd next time .
i left urgent care for cvs to get a prescription filled .
unacceptable .
the next time i need a pharmacy , i 'm going back to walgreens .
i 'm gon na move over to another cvs .
not really a friendly `` customer service '' oriented type of gym .
not responsive to members requests .
too busy doing their nails , homework , or talking .
seems to be a control issue with the bike class passes too .
this gym got new owners january _num_ so disregard any reviews from past years .
slowly but surely the owners have worked towards driving the current gym members out .
first the coffee and juice bar were closed , then towel service ended .
a ) it 's very affordable .
probably , no .
my salad came out quick ... too quick .
my chicken was n't hot .
tasted just like chef boy r d from a can .
no biggie .
decor is plain .
looks like the interior of a diner more than that of an italian restaurant .
_num_ of my all time favorite foods that i can only get here .
but i feel the need to report a problem .
this is the second time this has happened sour cucumbers in the salad .
there is simply no excuse .
and too top it off tonight our eggplant was raw .
well my daughter and i went in for lunch .
i 'm really disappointed .
do not eat here !
terrible food , a shame .
lasagna bland and mushy !
maybe i was expecting a real italian restaurant but it was extremely casual .
pizza was downright lousy .
completely forgettable .
worst pizza ever !
my husband said papa johns is better and he hates papa johns .
these reviews are cracking me up .
i 've been to this restaurant twice now recently to try it again .
and service was slow .
i scheduled my appointment online .
the day of my appointment , walked in and signed in .
i 've never been treated like that before .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
it just was n't very good .
complete and utter disappointment .
i just went in here and got some tacos for lunch .
and they give you one sauce for _num_ tacos .
stayed away for a month and went back one late evening recently .
the churros were old and dry .
gross .
this review is rather about a shady credit card charge at this particular location .
$ _num_ , as always , awesome .
when i went to the store to show them nobody even apologized .
only good when drunk really .
no luck .
terrible .
this time however there was a bone in my shredded chicken taco .
this location is horrible .
i guess they will get my business from now on .
overpriced and horrible .
worst experience ever .
staff was so stupid .
went to the appointment and waited for almost _num_ hours before seeing anyone .
felt like i just took my car in to the repair shop .
he explained everything to me , including pricing .
i 've been using this pet hospital for over _num_ years and was satisfied .
_num_ .
the rudest front desk staff you ever could hire .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i 'm beginning to believe that this location only cares about money !
banfield pet hospitals need to have the corporate office close them down !
when i get there , sometimes they ca n't find my order online .
it 's not fun to have to do their job for them .
if they could just get it together it would be nice .
i have n't eaten in over _num_ hours and my blood sugar is dropping .
this is ridiculous !
however , after the service , we were really regretted to see him .
this probably the last time we will attending the friday night steak fry !
was a horrible experience .
i walked into this store while _num_ store employees were chatting at the counter .
i stood near the counter but far enough away for them to finish .
so if you want to be treated like an idiot go there to eat .
costco 's pizza is better and a whole lot less expensive .
yea dont feel it .
annoying .
and the bill was unbelievably high for the quality of the food .
crispy bacon is is critical though for this dish .
_num_ .
make a sauce with the noodles already in it .
the meat was weird .
it 's a bummer that it was a bomb .
disappointed .
lame .
previous dine-in visits and carryout from them were much better .
_num_ inch is almost as small as a personal size pizza .
tried the tuscan and cracked crab alfredo pizza .
i will not be back .
the pizza was good but was nothing out of the ordinary .
dessert was a complete let down for me .
never gon na go there again .
i was told i could leave by _num_ .
chandler urgent care said this is their billing practice .
Neutral
the medication the doctor prescribed me damaged my nerve system and liver .
nothing urgent about this place .
they billed it as an emergency room visit .
it was ridiculous .
worst hospital ever !
i received a ct scan after several hours , which i understand is standard .
but , no ... .
not here .
this place was disgusting !
my baby and i were put under unnecessary stress .
i filed a complaint with the director of nursing , which was handled promptly .
my experiences with chandler have not been too great .
for two separate visits , i had two separate bills ( obviously ) .
i was carrying all the patients stuff instead of being given a bag .
nothing is consistent .
of course he refused .
she did one visit and passed me with flying colors .
chandler regional is not a great er .
yes , patients are admitted and they get access to medical care .
nobody seems to be involved in improving the patient experience .
not at chandler regional .
sure , there are great doctors and nurses here just like any hospital .
just my $ _num_ .
super ridiculous long waits .
worst experience ever .
my mom stayed behind because jasmine was scared .
we left and will not be back .
an iv was put into my hand and i was given some medications .
these dr 's and nurses are not properly trained .
zero compassion .
they do n't check in .
i checked in to get treatment for this issue .
this was just to charge more money .
worst hospital experience ever !
stomach bug probably .
the lab results showed nothing of the sort .
i was in extreme pain and made to sit in the lobby .
he spoke to me as if i were a two year old .
she said well then just get more pain meds .
i went to chandler regional hospital with my mother .
it took the hospital staff over _num_ hours to clean it up .
zero stars for her .
there was n't .
so freaking ridiculous !
drove across town for nothing !
i was in the hospital back in february to give birth to my daughter .
none of those things actually happened .
however , the billing department is full of absolute morons .
no stars !
this place is a joke !
avoid it !
the er has been hit or miss for my family .
they have a lot of traveling nurses and nurses that are just plain overworked .
wait out turn in er .
here 's my edit to add on .
but here goes another review .
gave my son a script and sent us on our way .
stay away from this hospital .
the place is a maze , older , fairly dingy .
the room was incredibly small .
just nasty attitudes .
nothing else so i was like ok ?
really horrible , and sad .
rip-off !
heard its closed , not surprised .
what a shame !
way big mistake .
now we seem to consistently get women who ca n't cut straight .
the latest one was particularly helpful and provided useful advice .
felt awkward and uncomfortable .
time ( one hour ) while dentist took my appt .
had to get a few fillings replaced , old silver one for white one .
that office is complete shit .
i really hate this place .
rip-off artists .
horrible , horrible experience .
i have been terrified of going to the dentist for years after going here .
they just filled my mouth full of holes .
under staffed under trained and over worked .
as long as they get you through to get their insurance money .
Neutral
cold cheap domestic beer in a strip mall dive .
terrible service .
i have been drinking crown for _num_ years .
they stated pet stains on the carpet .
worse property company ever .
they cost around $ _num_ depending on type of frames .
they normally have friendly and knowledgeable staffs there and never had any problems before .
total rip off !
tonight , that all changed .
general tso 's chicken i 'll miss you .
the quantity of food was small in comparison to my previous experiences .
walked in .
too salty .
normally this is my go to place for chinese .
went and got the orange chicken and chicken and broccoli .
very , very bland .
no flavor .
maybe they just gave up .
not great but better for sure .
i would like to know where they get these people .
how incredibly nasty !
i had to rush right home and shower !
pita jungle in general gets _num_ stars , this location gets _num_ .
it tastes like diet food .
it was too dry .
my fiance and i went there for an anniversary dinner on a friday night .
same setup as all the other pita jungle restaurants .
i could n't believe it .
no , not yet .
do n't expect to be wowed too much .
the salads were for my vegetarian friends , and i 'm allergic to chicken .
sorry , try again .
in the meantime , i suggest you try to get it together down there .
however , the service is very spotty and hit and miss .
my family was seriously running away from me .
i suggest going there instead !
i took 3-4 bites and had dragon 's breath immediately .
ruined it for me .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
my least favorite pita jungle location throughout the valley .
maybe we just had an `` off '' experience ... it happens .
the service is hit or miss .
if there 's any plus , it 's the back patio overlooking the lake .
our appetizer was served by a runner and another runner served our entrees .
she quickly responded , `` oh yes .
she acknowledged that i had ordered wine and left to go get the glass .
she was so rude .
do n't eat here .
only once out of the last seven times was the experience timely .
unbelievable .
i love pita jungle !
not exaggerating .
hummus was not good .
they have messed up my delivery _num_ times !
not impressed .
ugh .
i have never seen deep fried home fries before .
the country potatoes were the best part and my pepsi .
biscuits + white sausage gravy should = delicous .
not here .
she grabbed _num_ menus and started walking over to a booth .
everything was bland .
was extremely polite and gave great customer service .
there were a few problems with our visit .
grilled cheese for $ _num_ ?
i turned around and saw it was inches away from me .
wrong .
not here .
waste of _num_ bucks !
so it was off to another restaurant that would appreciate our money .
it was n't the greatest food .
the prices was way too high .
all four of the meals that my party had were substandard .
answer : bad .
not only that but the floors were very grimy .
burgers were _num_ and up .
you get your choice of cheese and i asked for cheddar .
but otherwise , from our experience , everything else needs work .
however , i wish it had been cleaner .
Neutral
it 's not worth it .
why accept new patients if you have a very long wait time ?
gross .
but because i have , i feel confident in my low score .
i am not going back .
i mean it this time .
convenient but poor service .
as soon as i saw it , i poured it out .
overall an unpleasant experience .
i am not going back .
i mean it this time .
what i got instead was a pumpkin bagel .
talk about a disgusting mess .
this place has had enough chances to earn my business - i 'm done !
horrible customer service everytime .
rude and very slow .
horrible service ' !
slowest service in chandler .
it was so weird .
very poor service .
issue that needs to be addressed .
terrible service , unfriendly employees .
not even plain .
so i 'm out , you win einstein bagel of chandler .
this location is awful .
my husbands breakfast sandwich was cold .
do not recommend this location .
they do n't close for _num_ hours .
yes chewing gum disgusting .
this is a breakfast place where people need to head to work .
her response , nothing .
so confusing !
terrible terrible terrible .
as restaurants go , they suck .
if you have other options , i suggest taking them .
terrible customer service .
he just looked at me .
he just pointed to the register .
completely rude .
very unprofessional and weird .
truly awful steaks !
bad cuts , bad cooking !
when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid .
$ _num_ coupon for a feast .
this is so weird .
if wal-mart ran a restaurant , this would be it .
veggies were mushy .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
unacceptable !
_num_ .
_num_ .
is n't complimentary bread included in the overall cost of the food ?
_num_ .
probably wo n't return .
it was simply a way to `` get through it '' .
the bill was $ _num_ .
the menu was horrible .
there was not one pasta choice .
burger was ok just ok .
worse than first .
just not a good experience .
personally , i thought his prime rib was a little salty .
very disappointing !
worst servers ever .
ruined ruined by staff .
this time was poor !
poor management !
she was late on refills as well .
i had the baby back ribs and they were good , not great .
would not recommend this location .
there were just a few tables in there dining .
however , the first thing i noticed was how high the prices all are .
was not appealing at all .
he was very apologetic and gave me a gift card .
she did n't apologize .
when it was my turn , i was shipping out a prepaid box .
i always ship with ups but this has made me second guess my choice .
it took way too long .
nothing helpful or polite .
boy was i wrong .
the coffee is worse .
and the prices are more expensive .
if you 're looking for a noisy after party hangout , this 'll do .
wi-fi is n't really free .
bad staff .
bad customer experience .
i thought the coffee was average at best .
it 's pathetic !
he has an urge to tell off atleast one person per hour !
and he is racist .
wish they had sandwiches or some real food besides sweets .
there was a greasy barista talking to a customer in the lobby .
my plan was to get _num_ pastries to take to work .
customer service has gone down hill !
if you want water , there are large styrofoam cups for it .
it was very unprofessional .
nothing better than anywhere else .
stick to coffee bean just a mile away .
_num_ strikes and your out .
it 's unbearable !
i got a shot of espresso and kindly walked my self outta there .
it was horrible .
this place sucked !
horrible wifi .
i recommended this place to so many people i 'm never recommending them again .
we walked down to coffee rush because it was right around the corner .
i regret going here !
they 're cheap , i 'll give them that .
this makes pei wei look gourmet .
i tried the wonton soup and the szechuan style dumplings .
how is this place getting all these positive reviews ?
no draft mex beers .
theirs were the kind of generic chips you can get anywhere .
horrible !
the waitress was very friendly but the service was spotty .
beans overcooked .
server was horrible .
avoid this place .
dont waste ur $ .
really ca n't scratch off a place due to a miss on service .
so completely overpriced for just your standard mexican fare .
not so much .
ok green chile , although they need a medium green option .
on the other hand i like the more modern style mexican restaurants myself .
i feel like i 'm back in junior high school .
i usually just get take out nowadays if i decide to stop by .
i 've been on the look out for good mexican food closer to home .
my experience was far from positive .
service was terrible .
seems to me that should be the other way around .
that is also unacceptable .
the only person who mostly enjoyed their food had ordered a chicken quesadilla .
still `` not feeling it .
the salsa was nothing special .
the food was mediocre .
not cool .
terrible sanitary condition .
unbelievable .
it 's very hard to understand why this place gets good reviews .
sure it 's not expensive , but i expect better quality for that price .
this was my number _num_ choice for dinner .
seated immediately , and our server was polite and attentive .
your first bowl of chips is complimentary ; additional bowls are $ _num_ .
it not worth the money .
for new mexico food , visit the state of new mexico for the food .
have n't been there in almost three years up until today .
this place is awful !
nothing to write home about .
very disappointing .
the enchilada sauce was basically just tomato sauce .
i could n't even finish it .
my husband and i ate here once , that was enough .
worst service ever !
but tonight , not so great .
it looked frosty at the time it was on the cart .
everything was slow tonight .
this last time i am being generous with _num_ stars .
service was slow .
i really like the salsa selections with the chips .
not happy at all .
not cool .
it sucks .
dish or direct tv has better customer service and cheaper rates .
i shut off cable and am using internet for tv now .
as soon as i find a better wifi service , i 'm out entirely !
cox is getting out of hand with their fees .
first of all the address on your website leads customers to an old location .
do not get cox phone service .
do not get cox phone service .
terrible .
not helpful at all .
i like cox cable over but the service here needs a big adjustment !
customer service is a joke .
lousy service .
i had better service with direct tv .
he tried selling me a suit and said it would be worth the money .
please beware and do n't ignore these complaints like i did .
Negative
not a single one was the right length that i asked .
it was very expensive , but he seemed competent .
instead he offered me a deal on another suit .
horrible customer service .
again , i explained i just needed a hem .
no apology given after the mess .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
first , measurements we 're off .
i am so glad i transferred care when i did .
my _num_ year old went in with an ear ache .
this is ridiculous !
this charge is a bit off the charts .
it 's not the expertise necessarily , it 's things like this .
not worth the money .
will not be going back !
never going to go back !
are you freaking kidding me ?
so gross !
we left very unsatisfied !
chunky but not spicy !
a mexican place that doesnt serve hot salsa ?
not this crap !
service was horrible .
walked in and several people were eating the menudo .
ordered my menudo with iced tea and my toasted bread .
so i added more crushed chili and salt .
but it was made to taste smokey .
my tea was horrible .
i would not recommend this location !
Neutral
brought my car in for a simple oil change and tire rotation .
i sat in the waiting room for almost two hours while they did this .
it was just due for an oil change , albeit slightly overdue .
a few weeks ago , i took my car in to be serviced .
my car was in their care while it was being serviced _num_ .
i just want to be healthy .
every time i show up to my doctors appt .
this is for the warner location however i can not find it on here .
overall the experience here has been rough .
the call never comes .
this is the only office i have visited .
horrible business practice .
convenient location but not recommended .
medications not delivered on schedule .
anyway this is just a summary of how things were for us .
so disappointed !
the food is gross !
she hated this place .
the dim sum was pretty tasty the first time i went .
stick with the dim sum .
dinner here was much better .
that 's where i 'll be sticking to from now on .
china king is above average but it is not in my favorite list .
so , i ate some shrimp spring rolls and sampled others .
maybe it was the coconut bread .
anyway , i ate that happily .
not of this place but of the super healthy veggie .
several years ago , this was the place to grab dim sum .
on a whim , tried it again .
so beware of that and do n't tip !
their servers were less than friendly and treated us like we were an inconvenience .
i was hungry and craving chinese , so why not i figured .
almost every piece had either bones or bone chips in it .
been coming to c fu a couple times a year for years ... .
ew do n't ever eat dim sum over here .
sometimes a cart would go by - a different table .
you can get your dim sum fix and forget about it .
why the _num_ stars ?
the service sucked !
and you wait forever for refills .
receptionist has horrible attitude .
honestly this review is a reality check for this restaurant .
disappointed .
gross !
it was just bad .
it tasted and the texture was very cheap ingredients .
but crispy , anyway .
the selection of dim sum was dismal overall as well .
so for regular entrees , this place is ok .
i used to love coming here for dim sum .
i only saw one full cart the whole time .
the baked buns are now larger but contain less pork .
worst possible experience .
service is extremely slow .
rule one of restaurant etiquette , control your kids !
there are big problems here .
saw him recently and he was doing well and wish him well .
we came back in early february for dim sum and then a meal .
peter was always around running things .
would n't take the chance .
this was our favorite restaurant especially for dim sum .
dim sum overall were slightly dry around the edges .
no thanks !
i 've already filed a complaint in bbb because of that .
one year after the service date , i finally knew such bill existed .
long story , long recipe .
sprouts market has cheaper prices on produce .
however , you will pay the price for it .
the code is _num_ .
you ca n't tell without you slice it .
poor me !
lee lee 's stinks .
rude rude staff !
i couldnt get past the front of the store to check it out .
i ended up buying two pieces out of the display case .
i have not opened them yet .
what a mess .
plus , prices seem more expensive .
its frustrating .
we 've shopped here on and off for several years .
not so much anymore .
that ca n't be good for business .
i wonder if they 've stopped going to lee lee 's too .
you guys need an inventory control system .
avoid this place !
nothing .
she did n't even thank me .
avoid avoid avoid !
however , unlike my first birth , this was much quicker .
actually _num_ stars .
this place is terrible !
total bull .
just brakes corporate would be mortified if they saw what i saw .
in this case , that is what drove me away .
i think crash , burn and die . ''
disappointing .
i went in to get my rear brakes replaced for $ _num_ .
these prices seem to be all over the place to me .
lol i think not .
never go to just brakes .
almost no one .
too much rice .
it was just about all you could taste .
excuse me ?
anyway , the sushi itself was about as flavorful as a ten dollar bill .
at least the sake is cheap and good .
not a good sign .
the food was n't that great .
went there tonight .
completely unacceptable !
las vegas roll - not the best i 've had , but good .
sad !
it was my bf and i first time at ninja 's .
we look at it but nothing sounds appetizing .
all you can eat is only significant if you can actually get some food .
simply ca n't be done .
i was wrong .
if you go , you 've got to try the _num_ roll .
it is a staffing problem , not a food problem .
in all these years , i 've never had it there .
my boyfriend and i had a groupon for this place .
the food was gross .
they literally gave me a side of hot sauce .
not a fan .
so not a great selection .
and the rice to fish ratio in the rolls was way off .
no sharing .
two of the rolls were just `` eh '' .
it was not good .
the wait was long , probably an hour for the first order of rolls .
table service was lacking .
never again ... ... .
wrong .
i went with my boyfriend on a thursday night .
how rude .
very disappointing .
we used to go here and i remember it being much better .
horrible experience .
please get your restaurant better organized .
empty !
plain rude .
wo n't be back .
the list goes on with this place .
later she was at a table drinking wine .
whether or not everything was fresh is questionable .
i got this app just because i wan na talk about this restaurant .
the california roll , jalapeo poppers and miso soup were decent .
service was awful .
the place looks run down .
does this business owner even read the reviews here ?
this was probably one of the better , more balanced parts of the meal .
all in all , steer clear from this place .
this place is definitely turning into a hipster place yuk .
the sashimi was surprisingly soft and yummy .
very disappointing .
seriously poor customer service .
for your basic project just stick to ace hardware or lowe 's .
would n't use them again .
i used to go there all the time until i met the owners .
they leave out the fact that there is yogurt in almost everything .
we will not be going back .
it was disgusting .
and i can find any other business to purchase my food from .
this place is gross .
that is what is printed on the sign as you walk into this place .
if not , i will expand .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
my problem was the food .
it came out cold and dried out .
i was offered another choice so i took the pork chops .
no kidding .
service is awful .
lady next to me to go to the bathroom , she was eating alone .
she had n't even started yet .
your my waiter , own the situation .
my son was served raw chicken in his sandwich here today .
totally raw and cold .
he ate half his sandwich before his fiance noticed .
the selection was horrible .
the restaurant was not very busy .
used to be my favorite place .
recommend they dig out menus and decor from _num_ years back .
tries to be upscale , but fails .
the place was empty .
wish i could write a review .
so i called for takeout breakfast .
turns out our name was never on the list .
worst service ever !
definitely decided next year , we 're doing turkey at home .
it was totally out of place .
my entire breakfast was cold .
my wife 's was hot .
no need to return .
i just ate at mimi 's for the last time .
i was beyond disappointed .
even with very few people in the restaurant you 'll wait to be seated .
yet another fancy rip-off .
the poor crepe .
again so flat .
did not really taste any .
these are $ _num_ and $ _num_ dishes !
i must be lucky to get _num_ whole small grapes .
we will not come here again .
anyway i chose the salmon .
i baked muffins this morning & i have enough at home .
terrible service .
drinks were not refilled .
anyhow , i 'm not picky .
the $ _num_ red house wine was good though .
got seated and had to wait longer for silverware after we got our salads .
wilted fries only .
wanted chicken and they are all out of chicken .
terrible service and food .
not so much now .
we will not be back .
husband was equally unimpressed .
just awful .
... then table that sat next to us ordered same plate with only shrimp .
dreadful meal .
it all came smothered in gravy - not on the menu .
i also took the turkey home to my dogs .
a most disgusting meal .
will not go back .
it was obviously not prepared by any chef .
what else do they never clean ?
photos of their food online are nothing compared to the real thing .
looks nice but is n't at all .
not a nice place at all !
we showed up friday night and they are semi busy .
ok no problem .
at the same time we never see our waitress again that night .
what a nightmare experience .
sake sashimi for $ _num_ ) .
we were excited to visit this sushi restaurant .
i called tonight and they said that they were too busy .
excuse me ?
extremely poor service .
an older man sat us down at our table , with papers on it .
did n't even say hello .
so he brought me orange juice which he chose for me .
they really need to work on hiring better employees .
i will not go back again !
when we walked into the restaurant it seemed a little busy not too crowded .
we started off with the fried calamari .
as a result , we put our utensils down and requested the check .
i would even rate how we roll in phoenix better than this place .
i stopped in looking for a table for just myself .
horrible .
the food quality is very cheap .
avoid this place .
we tried this place for the first time on a friday night .
we tried this place for the first time on a friday night .
just 3x as much money .
i hate you shimogamo .
i really hate you .
pretty bummed they closed an hour early without any explanation as to why .
i will never be going back .
customer service , more seating and more affordable sushi .
they f you in the drive through .
that 's fucking disgusting .
they may get another chance but i am far from wowed at this rate .
first time they served me oatmeal in a cup .
absolutely ridiculous establishment .
might as well be closed if they are going to do that !
we 'll resolve it next time and that never happens .
this is not rocket science .
i am _num_ years old .
terrible service .
i have _num_ high end watches that needed batteries .
it was only batteries after all .
the man sitting immediately got up and asked if he could help her .
i was pretty disgusted .
it 's hit or miss .
im so glad i dont eat this bs any more !
there are many better places down the road with better quality food .
counted at least ten ants in one stall alone !
i will not be coming back .
they also frequently serve old food .
new management or ownership is really needed here .
no lettuce .
1st window repeated it .
nasty .
dirty ... bad customer service .
says she is doing everything she can , but really is she ?
nothing special .
the mashed potatoes were nice , and the garlic broccoli was fine .
nothing special .
southern food does n't hurt me .
this is painful .
i was like ok , where to you get those ?
gross .
however , there are some issues that i have .
this last time i arrived early so that i could get a table .
my youngest , however , needs my assistance .
however , it has been like that each time .
with two small kids , this has been a problem .
terrible .
our _num_ year old cost $ _num_ .
do n't go into the bathrooms .
ugh .
`` oh yeah , we called you but nobody responded . ''
i have been a fed ex customer for over _num_ years .
went online , had packaged held for pickup at this location .
ca n't help you .
scan and email some legal documents back to my mortgage company .
i was wrong .
the worst part ?
went in today to ship a package out using ground shipping .
unbelievable .
do not go to this location .
( fedex 's problem , not my drive . )
disappointing , and terrible !
horrible !
i tried housekeeping and every other button and it was busy .
disgusting !
the wifi is horrible .
there is no jacuzzi .
drove from san diego to attend a concert at the wild horse pass casino .
_num_ .

customer service was ok.
not enthusiastic when answering the phone at night .

the lamp shade had a hole in it .

it was decent hotel to stop at and sleep for one night .
this hotel needs to be managed better and definitely needs to be cleaned .
the room was not clean .
seems like he remembers his regulars .
i will not be back .
flat pepsi .
cold food .
my daughter didnt ' find the orange chicken that great either .
so bad !
would n't take my dog there .
had chicken and vegetables in brown sauce in a bowl .
carrots all tasted old .
highly disappointed in eggroll .
no one ate much .
disgusting !
yakisoba tasted old .
never going back .
very sad .
too bad .
i tasted a few pieces and the sauce is indeed very different .
i could n't finish the chicken .
i think _num_ star is being a bit generous .
will just stick with aloha kitchen much better food .
the resturant looked clean and was busy .
i ate the rice around the chicken and tossed it .
had the chicken and broccoli , pretty sure the chicken was cooked yesterday .
no flavor .
could n't finish it .
on _num_ occasions my teriyaki chicken bowl had a small chicken bone in them .
do n't really recommend .
the chicken often has little vibes in it .
the worst food poisoning ever .
my review will be in _num_ parts , the first for the actual food .
for the record , i 've been eating at tokyo house roughly _num_ years .
i normally ask for it spicy but went regular this time around .
what am i really paying for here ?
_num_ $ for just a bowl of noodles ?
not the best korean food i had .
do not order japanese food here .
oh thank you god !
i have tried many different nail salons in the valley but never been satisfied .
do not go to this place .
they refused .
ugh .
they did a total bait and switch on me .
it was absurd .
but i do n't care .
it was very unprofessional .
the food was fine , the issue is with the soda dispenser .
i would not come here again .
she said they are already discounted .
the once $ _num_ breakfast biscuits are now $ _num_ .
two hundred percent increase in less than _num_ months !
staff is not the friendliest .
not _num_ hours on friday .
if you 're closed , shut your lights off .
it 's not rocket science .
please just go out of business .
$ _num_ down .
no exaggeration !
several years ago , my cat had a tooth pulled here .
avoid at all costs .
flash forward a few more weeks , the dogs ear infection is back .
the doctor is very old fashioned and his equipment is as well .
terrible customer service !
horrible customer service !
the prices are higher then most gun stores .
for _num_ gun competition some months ago .
the front sight is rotated a little off center .
just like i requested originally .
except it is n't easier for a few reasons ; _num_ .
is that not the sole purpose of being in business ?
from firearms , to accessories , to batteries , to ammo .
unbelievable .
this gun shop deserves a rating of lol .
... empty .
... not answering the phone .
i would not go back .
i really liked it the first couple times .
did n't care for it .
go a few blocks west to saigon pho if you want the real thing .
i was so mad .
the food is bland .
probably everything else .
hopefully in future this review will remind me never to visit this place again .
what a rip off .
finally , it is ridiculously over priced for the area and quality .
$ _num_ ?
i cant imagine an employee getting away with that . )
bad first impression .
second , the food was average , i have had far better vietnamese food .
third , servings were small for the price we paid for .
fourth , this place is ridiculously expensive for a vietnamese place .
i do n't recommend this place .
the plastic seats made it feel like i was at a burger king .
the service was so so and the prices were a little high for pho .
pho for $ _num_ ?
no thanks .
it was that bad .
bottom line : never hurts to try a new spot .
you 're paying for the modern orange walls and acrylic chairs .
stick to pho chandler .
horrible service .
cheap plastic furniture starts it off .
lastly the short ribs matched the other two dishes .
the food is just ok .
sooooooo , this is the 2nd time we ordered from this particular dominos .
i just know that i will seek other advice for my eyes next time .
this was not the case .
when she greeted me she asked for my date of birth and name .
the 2nd girl came back in about _num_ seconds with my contacts .
what made me scratch my head was the set up of the machines .
very uncomfortable .
- products ( shampoo , conditioner & body wash were okay . )
made them rush me through .
then forever to get food .
never a problem there .
so disappointed .
the towels are n't hot .
but _num_ % discount ?
ugh .
it sucked .
sounds like a great deal , right ?
also , the specialty drinks were legendary .
the bad ... price .
in fact , they were very pretentious .
our waiter kept trying to rush us the whole evening .
glass of house pinot noir now $ _num_ .
desert schools is neither !
do n't have direct deposit ?
do n't go to this branch !
wish i had never opened an account here .
does my bank believe me.
guess not !
horrible branch .
i came back and still the same situation , _num_ tellers and long line .
big mistake !
( there are also some seriously scary reviews on other sites .
they were roughly 1/3 off retail price .
i fully explained that i was going to purchase tickets online .
no return call .
they refunded me with cash .
i submitted his bid to my insurance company .
no call ... nothing .
no call .
can not recommend them .
they had done nothing .
do not hire this company !
called porter for a quote on a tile repair job .
so , there i am and they like - we not open till 8:30 .
these guys are a joke .
was getting an oil change and a new rear tire on my bike .
shopped around on the phone with several valley hd dealerships .
wonder if the owners know that this is the way their management treats customers ?
totally disgusted .
finger prints and dirt all over it .
there are plenty of other dealers , any other one would probably be better .
.
not a dealership that i would trust .
even some of the cashiers at this location look a little sketchy .
prices are typical nothing special .
i brought my german performance vehicle in to have an oil leak checked out .
each time a different operator answers and says they are n't at that location .
it was just an appointment to get electrical on our trailer hitch .
nasty .
had an appointment for a hitch install at _num_ am .
i am a regular at aj 's and have kept quite long enough .
not freshly cracked .
no crisp whatsoever .
there was very little cheese .
it 's not a difficult thing to prepare .
i 'm going back to safeway where the customer service is beyond awesome !
we had been to the one in phoenix and the cuban sandwich was awesome .
thanks but no thanks .
i went in to get a pedicure for myself .
so it pains me to write this review !
i will not be returning .
anyway , this time my oldest picked indian .
this had a couple kinds of chicken , a meat samosa and lamb kabob .
my daughter got chicken tikka masala , her favorite .
these , too , were fine .
in phoenix , there are essentially _num_ types of indian restaurants .
i expected my food to be freshly prepared ... all of it .
been a long time customer ( _num_ plus years ) .
when the bill come , it was a little more expensive than i thought .
naan is _num_ each ! ''
i went there last sunday , after reading all the great reviews .
terrible , terrible , terrible service .
$ _num_ for gel nails .
disappointed .
there is virtually nothing on the menu for a vegetarian .
lame overpriced toys .
they too were `` meh . ''
success !
amazon is where i will buy toys now .
wrong !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the woman who answered the phone offered me a special price of $ _num_ .
so why _num_ stars ?
i am paying $ _num_ per night .
not worth the money .
so it does n't makes sense to me .
really bad .
very very dirty carpet .
ac would n't work .
if you stay here you get what you deserve .
this place sucks .
horrible customer service .
but we stayed _num_ days and it was okay .
probably _num_ to _num_ stars .
the furniture could use updating .
the front desk was helpful .
oh my back is killing me .
does n't change time .
the room was blah .
sure could use some updates .
cleanliness is not their first priority .
this place is gross .
for the price we paid it should come with better cable tv .
and everything looks dingy and old .
internet does not work .
it was the smallest room i 've ever been in .
hurry up and get her a room .
she 's been complaining of not feeling well . ''
the sink was dirty .
all i had was a potato .
really dry .
not tasty .
after three tries with this location , i 'll stick with metro center .
the bread was toasted and the tuna had eggs in it .
plain dont mean please put tomatoes and bacon , onions in it .
so fyi do n't order delivery they read it back to me right .
this place was n't very good .
i could n't even finish it .
would not recommend at all .
rude !
_num_ .
_num_ .
my girlfriend tells me the ladies bathroom had live bugs on the floor .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i could n't even finish my food .
that 's it , i 'm done going to jason 's .
: )
i went in to ben jewelers to have a ring fixed .
then i get a call telling me the repair fees to repair this !
i refused .
weeks go by , and i just went to pick my ring up .
garbage .
stick with foot locker .
worst service ever !
completely disappointed !
i visited this location last night with my boyfriend and his daughter .
unbelievable .
ridiculous !
i was very disappointed !
i was offended .
completely rude .
we couldnt even get them from other stores !
horrible place !
they refused .
they always ask , `` are you sure ? ''
the apple store sells computers .
and more importantly , the apple store repairs computers .
and then the wait .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
before here , i had went to verizon .
terrible experience .
they run this place like it 's a doctors office .
i 'm calling bs on this .
i have been a loyal iphone customer for over _num_ years .
went in to get some information for an ipad purchase .
guess it 's going to snow in phoenix pretty soon .
once again another let down via the apple store chandler .
absolute nonsense .
are you kidding me ?
ya i signed off that that may happen .
very frustrating .
talk about the worst .
had to go in about a month ago to get a screen replaced .
( again , usually two bars less than others right around me ) .
very poor service .
i sent my mom in there because she needed her iphone looked at .
she treats everything like gold .
they replaced the phone and solved the issue .
and they have not solved my issue at all .
i 'm so disappointed .
worst customer service !
!
yay !
however , as soon as i got home it already has another issue .
( assuming phone is somewhat working ) .
: ( let 's wait a week to see what else happens .
when i arrived i knew exactly what i was going to get .
the apple expert walked up and immediately called me jonathan .
there were more staff in the store then customers !
much less than what i had paid just a few months prior .
very disappointed .
tech support was rude .
they always seem to have a not so pleasant attitude .
totally refused .
this is a fairly standard sub $ _num_ service that jewelers provide .
completely obvious mistakes , visible to the naked eye .
is a customer worth that little ?
but it usually ran over a week , sometimes more than two .
would not recommend .
rude .
rude .
i would never recommend them .
very disappointed .
hard to communicate most of time .
so avoid her please .
do n't look and treat people like you 're better than them .
i was shocked at dillard 's in chandler tonight ( thursday ) .
i took it off , and took it back to the store tonight .
they are money hungry assholes .
i walked out one day .
i hate salesmen that lie .
got caught in a _num_ day return policy .
i ordered corned beef hash and eggs .
the eggs were cold .
presentation was horrible .
my wife ate half her food and i never touched mine .
i will not be back .
i know , i know , breakfast place , order breakfast !
i 'm adding a pic of the manager in the purple shirt .
you fell off the wall .
no more !
therefore , there is a honey shortage .
i am not convinced .
ambience : casual and also not busy , which is strange to me .
nothing to write home about .
at least they 're friendly there and they 've never messed up my order .
meats , milk , cheese , you know that stuff is n't cheap .
apparently lowes urgent care is _num_ days !
_num_ days and not a specific time .
not a worker in sight .
she only responded with a blank stare .
poorly stocked also .
not my favorite restaurant , but its something besides taco bell .
tried the nachos last time , they were good .
we will not be going back .
the service here is usually _num_ stars .
disappointed .
no toppings at all .
i was there with my _num_ year old granddaughter and her mother .
really i am a _num_ year old lady holding my _num_ year old granddaughter .
i paid extra for grilled veggies and extra chicken .
disappointing .
ah , good ol ' _num_ and diner .
we walked in and were greeted and seated almost immediately .
maybe that will bump this place up to _num_ stars !
ugh .
the feta cheese was dry .
at least the other locations are apparently staying open .
review is for the service department .
they replaced the transmission on my company vehicle .
we brought our _num_ in over a week ago .
( without ever even raising my voice ) .
we were @ $ _num_ from our max budget .
please consider our experience with this dealership prior to your visit .
having first oil change in this little car .
employees using the same restroom customers do .
after not hearing from anyone , i called at 3pm .
that seems a bit strange to me .
in my opinion , dealerships need to recognize this and respond appropriately .
terrible service !
bad treatment for customers .
well now the gm mike cook stops the customers from getting washes .
bad business .
horrible , horrible .
`` you never get a second chance to make a first impression '' .
but my service advisor `` chris '' , is a completely different story .
i am to get free car washes and half price oil changes for life .
my car was not clean .
incompetent !
plus i already have financing through my bank .
i gave one star because i could n't give none .
they gave _num_ % of what my truck was worth .
the seating in the waiting room was minimal .
change oil and rotate tires .
i recently had this experience while trying to purchase a new truck .
i promise they wont disappoint on that end .
horrible and liars .
shortly after my review a response was posted asking me to contact them .
so i put my concerns in an email and sent that to him .
still no response .
8:30 this morning .
i understand why you must charge more .
this is the second time this has been done .
they are just ridiculous .
totally disgusted .
shady as hell !
i want to give the management props for the feedback .
how else would they have been able to check my credit ?
would you guys quit already !
that 's a bit lengthy though .
sorry , bad suggestion .
there is a reason you only have a _num_ star average .
at least a _num_ hour wait .
sub-par service .
this _num_ star review is for the sales team .
stop calling me !
big mistake .
not a good idea .
poor customer service .
rude .
needless to say the warranty ended .
i 'm military so i live my life by my _num_ army values .
ridiculous .
i called the services department for an estimate service time for an oil change .
and then you keep calling me .
cvs minute clinic dropped the ball , big time !
then diagnosed him with what the computer said which was a miss diagnosis !
the reason for my _num_ star review ?
then we walks away .
so i wonder around for a bit then give up and leave .
_num_ stars for customer experience at the hand of staff .
wrong .
does n't work .
it takes him all of _num_ seconds and hands me the key .
nothing but attitude .
terrible service .
my fianc and i ordered a product online .
they were very rude .
place needs new employees .
everyone is rude and unfriendly .
it is _num_ .
never can get help associates walk right by when im clearly looking for something .
which is not the case .
he gave my already anxious boyfriend a panic attack because of his actions .
sometimes you really should listen to your patients .
i will not be returning .
avoid this store .
horrible wait time .
workers are super slow .
horrible !
no call back .
no results .
wish we never left verizon .
i 'm just going to deal with another sprint store from now on .
terrible customer service .
_num_ year warranty .
do n't switch
so as my phone constantly tries to connect the battery life is shit .
terrible customer service .
hampton inn which is next door and also hilton seems like a better option !
disappointing .
the housekeeping staff needs additional training .
two people stayed in the room for _num_ nights .
do they really expect one little bottle of shampoo to last that long ?
also individual oatmeal packets and hot water instead of real oatmeal was provided .
hampton inn style waffles appeared , but only during the weekend .
it sounded like a jet engine every time it started .
taco bell cooks better .
there were a few patrons sitting down .
since it is very close to my apartment , i might go back .
i went back for lunch .
she ca n't eat beef .
when they are full they ca n't handle the volume .
i thought i would try this place out and support my local taco shop .
unfortunately i got screwed !
not impressed .
food was terrible .
did not feel me up .
just terrible food .
that was not cool .
zero stars .
very poor service .
does not earn even one star .
disgusting .
worst manicure ever !
she was completely rude .
employees need more training .
prices are very affordable and the food is ok .
my first impression was that the dining room was extremely small and crowded .
i will not be back again .
they sat _num_ other groups .
sadly , i was unimpressed .
also kinda rude .
basic ingredients , the food was something anyone could have easily made at home .
very generic subpar food at high prices .
no call .
i went into purchase a mattress over memorial day weekend .
still no call !
they eventually printed out another one with much trouble .
don '' t do business with these guys !
overall it was an ok experience .
the old tile in the entry way needed to be removed .
mistakes happen .
they completely destroyed the new cabinet installed as well as my brand new microwave .
do not use this company .
horrible .
i have been to the dentist before .
your dentist asked that i prep your tooth for your crown .
_num_ more minutes !
oh , and it 's not over .
very disappointed !
i could spend my life savings in there without much of a thought .
this store fails .
this store needs a serious corporate overhaul .
the customer service level also needs some upgrading .
luckily i could find the supplies i needed without needing any help .
very bad customer service .
it 's also messy and cramped !
keep your candy bars , chandler residence inn .
... ... motel _num_ !
no complaints there .
it indeed was sears to my surprise !
or maybe it 's a case where they 've become too big to care .
what a disappointment .
portion size is way down .
i only order for either a veggie bowl or a chicken bowl .
this is the 5th time they screw up mine and my friends ' order .
every time i order online , they never have it ready , never correct .
going to the chandler mall one from now on .
always got the chicken , either in burrito or bowl .
then ended up not giving me the guac for the chips .
my rice is hard my lettuce looks old .
i got two enchiladas , one chicken and one beef .
bad day ?
the salads were made with wilted lettuce and sore looking tomatoes .
however this is ass become less true over the recent years .
i had the wood fire grilled salmon .
quite irritating and inconsiderate actually .
i ordered the creamy lobster mashed potatoes and a cup of the clam chowder .
but ... damn their seafood needs some change .
i could n't even finish the meal .
first bad experience though .
long long long long wait for condiments and extra biscuits .
: / not cool .
we came here saturday night , because , i have been craving lobster .
the restaurant is under construction , so it looks tacky and smells like chemicals .
the ice tea has cranberry juice in it , which is their signature drink .
another waiter brought us out our food .
this was expensive night out .
next was a caesar salad , which was good .
for my entree , i had the grilled honey bbq shrimp .
for dessert , i had the brownie .
lobster was not fully cooked .
we both ordered grilled and steamed seafood dishes with salad & vegetables .
what was wrong ?
walked around the restaurant .
if you feel like getting a kidney stone , come here .
the sauce had oil sitting at the top of it .
sick !
nothing on the menu looked fresh .
will not return again .
just real bad service .
wont be back !
soup , red curry bowl and the coconut princess dish .
this is where it begins .
pad thai : average ( at best ) flavor .
tom yum soup tasted only like chicken broth .
not worth it .
the only vegetarian oyster is an oyster mushroom !
i mean , this thing was a pretty decent sized chunk of bird .
)
overall nothing really stood out .
we 'll keep looking for a better thai place to become our local go-to !
the waitress came and grabbed the dish away .
it was just ok .
such an unacceptable behavior .
totally ruined my day .
i was wrong .
no thank you .
sad very sad .
i was not happy with taste .
pad se ew had alright flavor but a little on the dry side .
now , this franchise has started charging for red peppers and cheese packets .
terrible decision .
but i ordered the buffalo pizza ( comes with buffalo sauce ) .
the buffalo sauce tasted more like a tangy syrup or something similar of .
threw my appetite off !
what a ripoff .
just like macaroni grill .
i went here with my husband and daughter for dinner .
a word of caution : never try any pasta dishes .
i like pepper but not overpowering .
we skipped dessert and took my leftover pasta home .
we ate at carrabba 's in chandler last night .
i caught the hostess drinking out of my child 's to-go cup .
the lettuce had been frozen and so it was wilted .
this was the first time i 've eaten here and the last !
this place makes olive garden look like a _num_ star !
the salad was lettuce , carrots and dressing .
i 'm not _num_ .
just from eating the salad and a couple bites .
the service was awful .
my husband just ate what he got .
service was horrible !
food was mediocre !
and i tried again tonight .
ate alone at bar to not take up much room .
no silverware .
it 's sad .
a little too late .
i 'm not returning .
they really skimp on the salad dressing .
portion portions portions !
the portions have gone incredibly down yet the prices have gone up .
unbelievable .
finished it quickly and ate the rest of my kids dinner .
stingy greedy corporate management .
i 'm disgusted .
hate it .
it 's a ripoff !
wrong .
what an ordeal .
!
disgusting !
just no .
i do n't get it .
they are disgusting !
this place is always busy and i 've never been able to understand why .
still have $ _num_ left on the gift card .
she really should n't have .
kind of on a side note , our waitress last night was really strange .
i do not understand it !
ok sorry for the rant .
but the to-go bakery orders get messed up every time i come here .
overpriced , underwhelming food .
it makes me die a little to write that .
my wife had the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap .
only the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream were any good .
the chance i returned to this restaurant is very slim .
the bread was cold and hard .
worst service ever !
i 'll be back , but not for breakfast .
btw , the food is under cook !
he did offer my husband another beer though and promptly brought that out .
if you must go to cheesecake , opt for the biltmore location !
service is mediocre .
will not be returning .
customer service was not that great .
why not just have us wait ?
dirty and expensive .
will not be back .
have n't been here in a while but not as good as i remembered .
also , expect to wait 3x the amount of time that you 're told .
this is a sign of a major problem in my opinion .
just wish they could be as good as the california locations .
that was n't any fun .
i was very fond of this place until last night !
just ignored it !
got orders all wrong .
i do n't remember this same set up at the phoenix location .
it can get pretty busy at dinner time , especially on a weekend !
thanks for nothing .
the burger was undercooked .
the manager came over replacing the pasta with a pasta alfredo which was excellent .
later on it got better .
this review is n't about that .
finally i flagged down the waiter and asked where the plantains were .
everyone else had already eaten .
my food was then cold .
not acceptable .
like way overcooked .
this dish was nothing spectacular .
kind of a disappointment .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
first off , i ordered the veggie burger without cheese or mayo .
the starbucks cafe was a joke .
stay away .
not my favorite place .
i was then promised a appointment at _num_ pm saturday .
everything is over priced ... really this is just a showroom for amazon .
the worst customer service .
too expensive on most products .
at walmart , $ _num_ .
f this place !
long story short .
they might not last anywhere else .
i get the charger i needed and walk to the front .
i see _num_ people at the customer service counter all talking to each other .
never shopping here again .
they would not help me .
auto pay should just be done in the store .
i grabbed my tower and went to my truck .
_num_ min .
_num_ min .
terrible customer service .
bull !
bad attitude , bad review .
i do n't drink alcohol so i do n't find the bar atmosphere appealing .
it used to be incredible .
the server was very polite .
_num_ .
she is only _num_ .
very disappointing food quality .
chicken with mozzarella sandwich and i had the salmon .
the rice was swimming in soy sauce and pineapple .
the salmon , just more frozen fair .
the hostess provided us with menus and the server was prompt to greet us .
are you kidding me ?
horrible service .
only sit if you have a bunch of hours to kill .
not a nice dude .
what a huge disappointment .
unfortunately the service was horrible .
huge disappointment .
however , not anytime soon .
none were to be found !
and walked off .
once again its not consistent .
really like sitting on the patio or in the bar area .
not on any planet .
i met with a few friends on friday night for dinner and drinks .
prices are higher than the average sushi restaurant and portions are less .
i have had way better sushi with more portions and cheaper prices .
prices are higher than the average sushi restaurant and portions are less .
i have had way better sushi with more portions and cheaper prices .
menu is limited and expensive .
service is ridiculously slow .
flat sodas .
next time , well , anything else .
really inappropriate .
the patio may have a different setup as far as the staff goes though .
we flag down our waitress and i apologized and point out the bug .
very small sushi portions !
when are they gon na expand their asian beer offerings ?
granted , it was a saturday night , but still .
the service was nonexistent .
i would not come back .
for how much money kona charges too .
overcooked but cold .
flavorless and expensive .
i said not good .
too bad .
tonight i walked in ahead of my team of _num_ .
sushi was horrible .
gross .
thick , thick , tough chicken .
bland food .
waste of money .
wrong !
then the manager insisted it was correct .
it was unbelievable !
managers running around doing everything except making sure good customer service is happening .
a miss for me .
i 'm bummed about this though .
the selection is really , really slim .
wish there was more peanut flavor to the dishes that call for it .
most panda 's that i have been too are pretty tasty fresh and generous .
their serviced was n't acceptable !
this is a bad !
each appointment was early in the morning & _num_ year apart .
i explained to the floor supervisor that i would be checking out late .
they left us high and dry .
i think i 'm just going to find another location .
disappointing location .
service is always horrible .
so disappointed .
bottomless fries but the staff never comes back after delivering the initial order .
we were so excited to try this place and it was a total bust .
which include a coke , beer , and chocolate milk .
i get the new fries but they are as cold as the first ones .
very disappointing .
i would not recommend this restaurant .
what a disaster .
i tried twice to pick it up and had grease running down my hands .
what a disaster .
i tried twice to pick it up and had grease running down my hands .
what on earth happened here ?
not worth it .
not even a lot .
mediocre service .
not very impressed .
there were ten of us , so i understand some issues but dear lord .
it was so bad .
i would not recommend this place .
burger was horribly overcooked !
the food is n't all that great .
my food came out cold and dry .
no excuse .
very disappointing .
not my best experience .
for shame !
horrible lunch .
server was nice , but ... everything in general not so much .
crazy ... stick to the sunday 's here ... .
i do n't do screaming .
their food is sandwiches ( hot or cold ) , soups , and salads .
i ordered a soup in a sourdough bread bowl .
really slow .
the soup itself was tomato garlic .
my friend had never been here before and ordered incorrectly for the pick _num_ .
she was so rude .
i 'm so embarrassed !
after coming here two times , this will be my last .
the food came fast , fairly clean restaurant , most things check out .
this was terribly overcooked .
generic , flavorless food .
then i pushed .
no open .
there is nothing `` fantastic '' about this place .
never going back .
i will not go back there .
any how i came in on a saturday afternoon .
shame !
it 's like the rainforest cafe of mexican food .
mediocre at best .
i will not be back .
the salsa tasted , ( and looked ) , like tomato paste .
chips greasy and thin .
salsa thin and watery .
i was very embarrassed .
first off , the atmosphere was nice .
no lard for sure !
my guess , flank or skirt steak !
shrimp cocktail was terrible .
chips are thin .
the cheese was weird .
i 'd never go back .
skip it .
it was very bad .
the ground beef was either old or spoiled and it tasted sour .
still deciding , huh ? ''
and then walked away .
they brought chips and _num_ salsas .
my bill was $ _num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
margarita was good but gone after just a few drinks .
_num_ .
jalapeo fritters were the best thing i ate .
_num_ .
yes , they have _num_ types of salsa ... .
_num_ .
just plain bad !
with their order , they received a plate of lettuce , onion , cheese .
one politely asked if they could get a little more .
i filled my glass three times , but the alcohol content was very low .
fried ice cream is not to be found anywhere on the menu .
their green salsa is out of this world .
there was a digital screen on our table !
it was literally white rice cooked with cilantro and i think that was it .
bland , bland , bland !
i had some shrimp , quesadillas and poppers .
i ordered the _num_ variety fajitas .
the rice was cold and the beans were dry .
i was totally wrong !
horrible rude disgusting food !
i ordered fajitas and my tortillas were all crispy and tasted ancient .
another horrible experience .
was the excuse .
sucks .
it was instant potatoes !
i buy those myself so i know what it tastes like .
it was like you were paying for the scenery , and not the food .
at valle luna right now and they 're salsa taste so much better .
every time i 've been back since the service has n't been much better .
this is not authentic mexican food .
so disappointed .
and i do love mac .
over the weekend , on sat .
thumbs down !
awful and absurd .
not good .
if not , scottsdale would be worth the long trip !
rude customer service .
very short and rude .
ummmm , let me check . ''
it would probably be better to just shop online at this rate .
so my girlfriend and i went to get our makeup done for my wedding .
they had to scramble to find somebody who could do our makeup .
no service .
no acknowledgement .
no sale .
i walked out .
then it died in _num_ weeks ( total death - nothing worked ) .
so they replaced it after a few weeks .
it was never opened .
nothing happened .
goodbye , i 'm going to macy 's .
store manager sucks !
i am done with sears , except for exclusive items that nobody else carries .
so , husband went in person and applied for himself .
no card , no number .
i asked for a price quote through their website the evening before .
do n't buy anything from sears .
Neutral
sears website said this location had _num_ available for sale with $ _num_ off .
no call back .
no call back .
he seemed more interested getting away from the situation rather than fix it .
at the end , i am returning everything .
it indeed was sears to my surprise !
i walk in the mall frequently .
$ _num_ a pizza is not average though .
first visit we used _num_ of the free meal coupons .
so there is obvious a service issue here .
i 'm scared to see what an actual thin crust pizza would be like .
we were picking up our purses to leave when the waiter finally came over .
grossed me out .
patrick he was awesome !
i had dinner here tonight with my friend and we sat in a booth .
she then walked away also .
very very disappointed .
so disappointed .
i , along with my brother ordered a pepperoni pizza and the baja chicken .
it was only correct that our food was paid for .
decor was average and it had nothing really memorable about its area .
very bland and doughy .
horrible customer service here .
baja fresh is going down hill .
unacceptable .
i usually ordered two crispy fish tacos , so i did the same .
the dread i felt when i saw them .
it was ridiculous .
i have been here twice and seen none behind the counter at all .
not like it !
so we charge what the computer says . ''
she rang up the jeans at the discounted price .
that 's not exactly accurate .
well , i choose , too .
there 's about three stores that have these same clothes and this is one .
you really need to be on the slim side to fit into these .
store tries to play off the `` so cal '' vibe .
my only complaints are the lighting which is very minimal and directed .
the worst service ever .
why not check it out .
do you not see a customer with a stack of pants to purchase ?
thanks but no thanks .
bad mall sushi .
( did i just blow your mind ? )
the worst .
its reheated packaged food .
the waiter needs to learn proper etiquette .
clearly under trained so i would look to the managers for that one !
consider yourself warned !
just a follow up to my earlier review .
_num_ .
entree : stuffed rigatoni with sausage & herb grilled salmon .
also , breadsticks are free of charge , too .
( but they are really salty . )
fast food experience at sit down prices .
by the end of the night , we were running out of this place .
service was ok - nothing special .
i really mean all of them !
never to come back during late dinner hours .
so disappointed .
i try to never eat here .
very bland food here .
but this place is very overrated .
purchased from their online site , had original receipt .
terrible customer service !
stayed here for _num_ days .
so let me start off saying for the price i paid it was amazing !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
think `` _num_ days of summer '' .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
salesman was pleasant but suggested purchasing outside vendor base to save money .
this is not the same company .
the only option they offered was to send it in for repair .
food wise , everything is way to salty for me .
wish i could give _num_ stars .
consistently gets order wrong .
brought a flash drive to have them make copies .
i had over _num_ copies .
very poor quality control .
i am planning on sending it back !
plus , my car has water spots as the car wash is so-so .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
stay away !
i 'm having the same problems as the other reviews .
big ripoff !
that 's right , _num_ .
they gave me the x ray and the examination but not the regular cleaning .
the receptionist started to deny what she said to me .
when i came back for the fillings was where it all went to shit .
i felt like pizza so this was closest stop .
coke i 'm assuming because she seen my water .
meh ... not rushing back.
we ordered the pear gorgonzola dinner salad and a medium thin crust margarita pizza .
it was hardly filling .
i was really disappointed .
too bad .
but the pizza , i thought , was subpar .
would not return to this location .
disgusting !
only took _num_ minutes .
total bill was $ _num_ .
wo n't be back .
my hat goes off to him for trying .
`` are you going to get a drink ? ''
and let me just say breakfast is not their strong point .
um , no .
this is the olive garden of phoenix .
really disappointing last night .
just not my thing .
i will not be going back .
when they came out they were all new york strip and not filet .
too bad .
i was not impressed at all .
one thing my friend did like was the jalapeo mayonnaise .
like the food but not so good at keeping the reservation .
probably not to eat though .
chipotle is overdone and overrated in our opinion .
service was n't good .
our waitress seem over worked and under extreme pressure .
terrible food .
will not be going back .
i figured after ordering _num_ $ worth of food in this restaurant .
this dinner was low scale .
the vegetables and potatoes looked the same on every plate ( pet peeve ) .
both were horrible .
Neutral
my husband does n't mind it but this was even too much for him .
sw caesar - chipotle dressing .
wasted $ $ .
shrimp and guac tostada bites .
if not - it 's a minor miracle .
enough with chipotle mayo on every dang thing you serve .
the salsa is chipotle too .
tortilla soup tastes like baby food .
rolling your eyes at guests is not exactly `` great service . ''
makes no sense .
unlike authentic chinese cuisine which requires a lot of skill and time to cook .
price is way too expensive .
she says oh , let me get you something else .
trouble getting a table at pf changs ?
i ordered the vegetable lo mein and my partner ordered the mongolian beef .
but the first thing i noticed was how few chinese people there are .
i tried one of the lunch bowls : pepper steak .
what a mistake .
the shrimp with lobster sauce has always been my favorite .
it sucked .
it was my absolute fave for _num_ years .
never !
what a lousy experience !
total disaster .
i really wish i had n't .
very disappointed .
either way not a good sign .
could have had the same quality at pei wei .
but i still feel pf chang should select better person for their reputation .
let 's begin with arrival .
ok , maybe she 's only dressed like a homeless person .
so , then , you 've been seated .
someone apparently dropped an entire bag of salt in the hot n sour soup .
could n't finish it .
to be honest i 'm not a huge asian food fan .
some of the pieces of chicken were scary and a bit suspect .
awesome shoes but the employees suck .
they just chill at the register .
the customer service sucked .
no wait .
but obviously you 're not too concerned about your online presence .
)
i was excited to know there was one close to me .
had to find a salesperson on my own to check on items .
terrible !
unbelievable how the clerk treated customers .
you wait hours and they stare at you .
this place is a hit or miss kind of place for me .
how low class can you get ?
horrible experience !
no compensation .
veggies hard as rocks .
we normally visit the tempe location which i would rate _num_ stars .
terrible service .
sitting in firebirds as i write this .
we purchase our beef from a frozen foods delivery truck to eat at home .
both my husband and i ordered the rib steak cooked the same way .
mine on the other hand looked more like a pork chop .
thin and gray throughout .
very disappointing .
we went to use my husbands birthday certificate , we arrived after 8pm .
very disappointed .
we were all very excited about this dinner and looked forward to it .
the rest of our evening goes as follows .
_num_ .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
we all added the lobster tail and i added lobster and king crab legs .
_num_ . )
they were rude .
disappointed .
for example the butter that they bring with the bread is not real butter .
they made my fianc old-fashioned incorrectly .
it was bland and tasteless .
thanks keg for making this holiday one to forget .
needs better trained staff .
let 's just say , our family does n't support that .
thumbs down !
however , the back of the house needs some work .
they did my eyebrows , and it was fine .
i have been to madison avenue _num_ times .
first time was ahwatukee location and it was the best haircut ever .
i left , in tears .
that was december of _num_ .
no refunds .
the cut was good but i still had major problems .
i went to the chandler mall to get another haircut in october .
i was not happy at all !
angry at beer .
not again .
come for the beer , stay for the ... beer .
man did this place suck .
avocado egg rolls were just deep fried guacamole .
it felt like i ate _num_ avocados as an appetizer .
i walked in planning on leaving her _num_ % .
they advertise their pizza as chicago style deep dish .
i 'm not quite sure exactly how i feel about this place .
the appetizers were just ok .
nothing to get thrilled over .
what a horrible idea .
sausage ... not so much .
overall not a good effort .
we had a mixed experience here today .
no thank you .
waited _num_ min to be seated .
hard to find parking at this mall .
i wish that was all there was to say .
big mistake .
big wait for a big let down .
are you kidding me ?
needless to say they were a bit full of themselves there .
i visit this location very often .
stay away .
had to send back to kitchen _num_ times a very simple order .
not impressed .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
so disappointed .
was busy but not crazy crowded .
waitress was not attentive .
careless staff .
walked in got a quick soup and salad before a movie .
it takes a cook to get a house salad and soup ?
servers walk by you and ignore you , it 's happened numerous times .
we will not go back !
customer service was also not the greatest .
frustrating .
it was ridiculous .
but i will be avoiding this starbucks location .
i used to shop at express in my early _num_ 's .
_num_ % off selected items ?
i may have been approached by the manager or assistant manager .
he was informative but not overbearing and he kept the sale floor immaculate .
the associate explained to me that they needed the merchandise too .
how stupid .
horrible horrible customer service !
Negative
i was busy , so my mom brought him .
first , i was quoted for one repair at $ _num_ .
what 's more , the part is only $ _num_ .
when i request updates , they simply tell me to be patient .
_num_ weeks for a lens repair .
_num_ days to ship from new york to arizona .
i can not speak to their repair work .
the service is clearly substandard and snobby .
we ordered the crab cakes , they were good , but not amazing .
the dessert we ordered was a ricotta cheesecake , the menu read with cherries .
what was delivered to our table was a chocolate strawberry cheesecake .
in other words , paying 3x to do the same job .
my first visit i tried the tenderloin carpaccio and the seared ahi tuna .
( i 'd give the first visit _num_ stars . )
a little gritty and not as tender as i 'd hope .
i would expect better .
i wont lie , these were amazing !
so everyone else had to watch me eat .
this was unacceptable .
i was very disappointed .
our group of six ate there on a friday night .
just not wowed .
nothing else on my plate , just the steak .
i know , i know .
too expensive for mid level quality .
i dine at steakhouses frequently , hillstone group , capital grille etc .
and this place has never been comparable .
for the prices , go to capital grille !
not worth the drive .
we had an emergency change in plans and they accommodated us quickly .
that 's gross .
and walked away .
lots of money for not much quality .
another positive was that my steak was cooked to perfection .
we ordered the chipotle mac n cheese and the peppercorn parm mashed potatoes .
overall , the seasoning of the food was substandard .
you were officially the lowest tip i have left in the last _num_ years .
my family of _num_ went with a reservation on a monday night .
was n't a great experience .
maybe skip this location .
tonight , i can not say the same about the chandler location .
very poor service !
the hostess confirmed that the room was available and happily booked our date .
the truffle mashed potatoes were good .
she did not eat but one bite .
i will not be returning .
_num_ turned into all day .
food was not so good .
worst location !
i wanted so much to like pei wei .
i went twice , getting different dishes both times .
i have to do my stomach a favor and not touch this food again .
my husband had the same but with tofu and vegetables .
it was very disappointing .
at least attempt to clear the tables so folks can sit down and eat .
today i am on the fence .
nothing like the advertisement .
i went around lunch time and it was pretty busy .
shame on that manager .
the food was n't worth it .
i 'm never going back .
this time , they used round noodles .
no wei .
even panda express is better than this place .
a few diners were still eating , and surrounding them were cluttered tables .
the sight was gross .
they served me raw beef .
there was more peanuts in these two than any other ingredients .
all were very responsive and apologized for the substandard service .
the food was horrible .
it 's too bad .
the lettuce was junk lettuce .
i ordered take out and tried the new mango steak salad .
these people are horrible .
so sad closed .
now you can only fit _num_ carts next to each other at a max .
i and two other customers had a coupon for frys large eggs .
really needs a remodel and new management .
as stated by several other reviewers the wait staff is good , especially jenny .
i came here a few times this last month during morning hours .
slow !
disappointed .
denny 's was busy too but far less than everything else .
they lost two clients .
he has been to this vet since _num_ weeks old .
he 's _num_ years old .
you 've seen all my pets and i 've spent thousands over the years .
just plain pathetic .
this is vet place not a bank .
she still seemed hesitant to let me leave with him though .
all they want is money .
shame !
then they increased their prices and it 's now $ _num_ !
are you effing kidding me ?
the mirror was taken to the back and wrapped by a stock associate .
terrible place to live .
you have been warned .
just horrible .
will not go back .
also , the pricing is not correct in the menu pic on this site .
not worth it .
too expensive .
the general sauce taste like pure salt .
no flavor .
it tasted very salty too .
some of the broccoli was yellow as well .
i 'm assuming that something changed about a year ago .
not really my idea of good time .
ca n't say the same about the food , though .
a restaurant with peanut shells all over the place .
it just felt dry .
either big fries , skinny fries , or tots .
ca n't beat their wings .
so , i order them like usual and the mgr .
i am so frustrated !
food was too dry .
my husband and i ordered boneless wings in _num_ flavors .
our fried zucchini was so over fried it was almost black .
huge mistake .
the apartments look nothing like them .
it looks like a _num_ 's motel room .
i 'm still disgusted .
they just do n't care !
horrible !
you 've been warned .
do not rent from this complex !
totally ruined my mood .
do not go to these people .
one star because i ca n't give less .
should we sign paperwork , and take it off the shelf ? ''
i hate pushy sales people .
i was pissed .
i was very careful too .
my husband had been buying me jewelry here for a few years .
just came in with my husband for my _num_ month ring inspection .
unbelievable customer service .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
do not spend money here they are evil !
i went in and there was a couple being helped , by one employee .
worst mcdonalds experience ever .
avoid this one folks .
worst mcdonalds ever .
complete idiots .
i guess a diet coke is too complicated for this mcdonald 's .
drink was somewhat flat .
all in all , i wish i had driven another mile down the road .
there were several other choices i could have made .
i got a too cool for school kind of vibe here .
in the future will go somewhere where my business is not such an inconvenience .
not true .
you would be wrong .
not my fault .
terrible customer service .
what does this _num_ year old kid know .
f ... u !
garbage !
its disgusting !
it feels dead inside .
one star is far too kind .
awesome follow through ... not !
that was march _num_ .
worst company ever .
no communication .
never use them .
worst experience ever .
he was very slow .
it was pretty gross .
$ _num_ ?
however , i would purchase a pumpkin pie to go for thanksgiving .
big ones and baby ones .
other things i have gotten here have been incredibly greasy .
it is cheap , i will say that much .
my veggie burrito came out quickly and steaming hot .
i still added lots of salsa too which i also enjoyed .
shredded iceberg does n't count !
`` authentic mexican food '' seems to be a complete lie here .
ick !
no flavor .
bland .
`` you just want your dollar back ? ''
the pico de gallo has a lot of minced jalapenos so beware .
i got a bean burrito with sour cream and a large horchata .
ok but seems to be living off its history and loyal patrons .
the burro was good , but messy .
no explanation .
i am a complete fish lover .
i checked out their website -- not too shabby !
what a disappointment .
it was a thursday night , not too packed , but busy enough .
so i sat on a book aisle .
so i went to the customer service area looking for help .
it was very busy in the whole store .
do not get nails done here !
_num_ .
did n't have black nail polish ?
_num_ .
did n't even last a week !
_num_ .
oh well guess that 's what you get for mall nails !
not impressed .
cheap , for sure ... but you get what you pay for .
awful awful awful .
horrible nail experience !
horrible !
i feel the management needs to overhaul their food servers !
trying to get that second cup of coffee is a real bear .
i really get the feeling that if your not a regular your not wanted .
the food was disgusting .
there is a pizza hut across the street .
the place looked closed but we looked and people were eating inside .
ordered mexican food , `` enchilada `` , tamale , taco plate .
i asked if they were home made and , server said yes .
do n't expect good service or food at this diner .
i got the chicken fried steak .
not edible .
service was awful !
the carne asada , on the other hand , was something other than good .
i drove _num_ miles one way .
nothing has been done that we can see .
she said that she was acting very , very ill .
just goes to show how much they dont care .
horrible horrible !
i will never return here .
at this rate i could of replaced the whole water heater .
never would of thought this would cost so much .
it also seems like they change out the furniture every two months or so .
that is horrible .
bad choice .
but not right by me .
thinking that they would know best we decided to give it a try .
the restaurant was packed and we were given three options of where to sit .
anything but chicken . ''
i ordered carne asada and my co-worker ordered machaca .
the machaca meat i think was shredded beef jerky , extra salty .
this is a chips , salsa and margarita review only .
salsa is _num_ stars .
chips get _num_ stars .
bad business ethics .
avoid at all costs .
the staff are loud in the mornings .
anytime i 'm at this location , there is only one checkout aisle open .
i took the $ _num_ shirt back to the cleaners to report the stain .
completely waste _num_ dollars .
lindsay confirmed this and the process started .
yep _num_ times !
so one of the two still has not closed .
worst customer service imaginable .
i used to give it _num_ stars .
potatoes tasted funky in the yellow curry too .
what a mess .
such a disappointment .
way too long to get food .
the entree was basically soup ; so soupy it was very messy to eat !
i was dead wrong .
for the money i would definitely advise avoiding this place .
sorry mint thai !
good for the food , just ignore the service .
my mom and i stopped for lunch on a saturday .
anyway , food comes out .
it 's not just with their entrees , but with their beverages .
is the tea made of gold ?
sorry , lost customer .
this place needs some serious management !
c'mon mcdonalds , get your stuff together !
in the ladies room there is currently only one stall open .
they ignore you when you 're standing at the register .
i feel like i 'm bothering them just ordering something .
also when we got our fish sandwiches , ummmm where do i start .
my fault .
he got out of the car & went to the patio .
i am so angry .
remind me never to drive thru here again .
if i check-in again - shoot me .
bad food .
this place has the longest wait times you will ever experience .
there are plenty of other places nearby for me to go .
we also substituted onion rings for fries .
this was a horrible disappointment !
very unhappy !
this place is awful .
very unhappy !
terrible !
i checked my receipt , sure enough $ _num_ .
i checked my bank account , $ _num_ .
i get it , mistakes happen .
if you want very specialized paper , this is the place .
also , nothing has a price tag on it .
they also are not overly helpful or friendly .
go to michaels , same stuff really , only cheaper and more selection !
if i 'm craving chinese food , i typically go to taste of china .
all of this only cost $ _num_ .
it was a disappointment .
would not recommend ever .
disgusting !
crab puffs are ok , large portion size .
very disappointing .
it 's not my favorite .
it does n't appear or smell the cleanest .
we ordered fried rice and wontons , as that seemed a safe choice .
wrong .
well , not kind of , it is .
i 've been there on about _num_ different occasions .
hell to the no .
avoid this place .
similar prices but better atmosphere and way better food !
$ _num_ for a single taco ?
sure tastes like it .
he just kept coming back and coming back .
i had the seasoned chimichanga and my wife had the shredded chicken chimi .
they came with sour cream , guacamole , rice and beans .
the drinks were horrible .
the kids meals do n't include a drink .
i have eaten only two bites .
waitress comes over gets money .
she comes back and says to me do you want a to go box .
it 's like a toss of a coin .
our waitress was very absent minded and quick to leave our table .
after lunch rush , but before the dinner crowds started coming in .
it was a tiny chile , with a dry thin batter .
and the cheese was a thick melted slice of american cheese .
it is not a cheeseburger .
this was so not the 5-star experience i was expecting based on previous reviews .
does n't look good .
just plain rude !
i was a loyal customer of elite nails for _num_ yrs .
i have been going to elite nails for over _num_ years .
and it began peeling off my nails .
i called the shop saturday morning and talked with tim , the owner .
she said they only booked a half hour for me for a redo .
the wife sent me down to the other salon where the husband was .
got my gel manicure and days later almost all my nails started to lift .
she never spoke to me .
that is rude .
does n't say a word .
no tip .
very disappointed !
she was extremely rough and even cut my toe .
i hate this place .
most likely will not return .
i 'll still go there for pedicures .
staff attitude was awkward .
they kept taking other clients before me too .
i am so disappointed .
cheesy elevator music is playing overhead .
my toes looked dumb .
their sushi menu is a bit confusing as well .
she said she 'd never had a bigger salt lick in her life .
this restaurant is not authentic .
its hard to find a good sushi place in phoenix .
majority of the rolls are made almost identical to the rest of the rolls .
- cream cheese , tempura .
over kill with the rice vinegar + sugar .
not good for takeout .
except a bit slow .
ordered three promptly ( 5th minute ) : primo , ca roll and sashimi .
not good .
but , the sushi items , rolls , etc .
just a note that the menu items shown on yelp is not complete .
the server behind the counter looked at us and that was it .
and lastly , even if the food was amazing the service was anything but .
not again for me .
cockroaches dancing on my chicken , salad , bread and wine ?
i ordered the greek salad with chicken and my mom ordered the steak sandwich .
the chicken in my salad was obviously microwaved breaded leftover chicken .
the waitress was in shock , very much like the rest of us .
the waitress comes back and says that she can only comp the spaghetti !
now , believe me i understand that these things happen .
i tried the bf 's baked spaghetti and it was just okay .
when i got my food it was covered with tomato sauce .
two totally different restaurants with the same name .
i went to this location with some co-workers at lunch time .
i think that 's being a little cheap .
will not be returning .
however they used this as a reason not to go through with our loan .
avoid this place !
rip off , rude , incompetent .
please avoid just brakes .
so , the guys said just brakes was cheaper and they had the part .
do n't go to just brakes !
my son went here to get his brakes fixed , charging them $ _num_ .
not good service .
the vet gave me medicine and fluids for the dog .
complete snobby attitude .
i will not recommend this vet .
i will try to be short .
i 've taken my dogs here for _num_ years .
after a long day of errands i stopped here on my way home .
service is awful .
we tried a salad and the new chicken , shrimp & sausage paella bowl .
discount pays for this repair only through network .
the first two repairs i had at this shop were fine .
in my opinion , they are not honest .
he cant walk , sleep , function .
i hate this place !
very frustrating !
i 'm glad i looked it up .
i will not be coming back .
not cool .
this is the final blow that had me searching for a new family practice .
urgent care is faster and the experience is way better .
i dread my visits .
terrible , awful experience .
she says and i kid you not , can you pick one reason ?
never go back .
i have been going here for years and they have always been responsive .
this place does not even deserve one star .
it 's not only me .
i thought i found the nice and close place to see doctor .
do not use this groomer !
bad move .
we ordered tom ka gai soup , green curry chicken , and cashew chicken .
plenty of chicken and mushrooms .
to be fair , it was takeout .
i will not be back .
i looked through the reviews ... it seems like things are hit or miss .
fail .
that was strange since the hours posted said they were open until _num_ .
we were sorely disappointed .
the place was empty .
the food was barely edible .
it still leaked afterwards .
i asked for another oil change as it had been a few months .
this location is a complete joke .
never get tires at fletcher !
horrible customer service !
they through the spare in my trunk with out putting it back in right .
to fix a flat ?
absolutely horrible experience !
they said my car could be done in _num_ hours , guaranteed .
david made it to just south of the city and it died .
hello that 's why people make appointments .
probably the most expensive mexican place of it 's style .
are we going back ?
very disgusting .
overall , not a great experience .
first off , i 'm a chimichanga freak .
i always get the chimi ( if available ) at new mexican food places .
$ _num_ for a chimi plate .
is it a sit down place ?
do they bring me my food ?
as another poster noted , _num_ cent charge on all cards .
that was almost unbearable .
all in all , lulu 's is just okay .
probably not .
very disappointed !
when we asked for chips she said that would be an additional $ _num_ .
lulu 's is my first attempt .
very skimpy for the price .
that 's just ridiculous .
fish taco and carne asada tacos were smaller than expected .
how has this place been around so long is beyond me .
looks like a family run business and nobody cares .
we stopped by tonight , a quarter to 9pm to get take out .
she was counting change and turned to look at the clock on the wall .
feel like i could have made the food better at my house .
horrible !
very expensive for nothing !
greasy gross food .
the chicken was dry .
they also charge a _num_ cent fee if you want to use a card .
i could be wrong .
apparently they run their kitchen better than they run the business .
the food was decent overall however it fell short the price tag .
nothing to really stand out .
a small container of spanish rice & three tortillas were included .
warning !
before the bean burritos were the best here for really cheap .
horrible attitude .
ate here for the first time tonight .
even if there is only one other car in there at the time .
it 's sad really !
cheap drinks but the bar and scene is very ghetto for being in gilbert .
cheap drinks but the bar and scene is very ghetto for being in gilbert .
my son is in the army and _num_ .
never had a problem .
went anyway , thinking maybe she was just busy .
gross .
nasty bar with awful service !
$ _num_ minimum if you are going to be using a card .
went in _num_ sunday 's ago to watch a game .
wait staff was not friendly .
food was crap .
are you kidding me ?
very disappointing .
skimpy on the beef , and they add requirements to coupons .
sadly , i was disappointed .
not my kind of music either .
annoying .
so not my scene .
not my scene at all .
but it was just a strange feeling and layout .
)
stop over charging for drinks .
very disappointing .
it is impossible to tell who is a guest and who is a server .
horrible atmosphere , horrible service .
the staff was friendly , the facility was clean and very modern .
$ _num_ ?
disappointed .
Neutral
two of us went for yearly exam .
and examination did n't seem thorough .
not impressed ; i do not recommend .
this place is very small and gets crowded very quickly .
asiago , and two more , i dont remember the names .
i like that i can get an iced coffee and get my own refills .
i stopped going here after my last visit .
ordered bagels last week for my team of forty .
service horrible .
she kept giving me cheap ones .
and when they do open there is only one person to do everything .
none in baskets in display case just on a cart .
my boyfriend ordered the turkey bacon avocado bagel sandwich on the cheddar jalapeo bagel .
i drove over and was greeted with my box of bagels .
she only returned to take my order when the manager told her to .
she never said anything to me .
i ate my bagel that i chose out of the very few baked bagels .
not impressed with this place .
employees come in late an nobody seems to care .
too bad .
below average experience .
very little salmon and green tomatoes .
terrible customer service .
cups of stuff laying around behind the counter everywhere .
super disappointed .
that guy sucks . ''
Negative
now it 's worthless !
strangely , they say there is nothing on it .
poor experience .
no thanks !
there was a lot of food , enough for 3-4 more average size meals .
if these are your favorite , ask about this first , imo .
!
atmosphere - gets my top rating .
food - mediocre .
i hate to say it .
the salsa that comes with the chips is only okay .
all three times i 've had service that was adequate but not amazing .
the food has always been , in a word , salty .
one word : dull .
it is just a typical chain restaurant .
i just will not eat here anymore .
the salsa was horrible .
bland .
i ate here before , never a problem .
this was not .
what felt like a piece of sand in the deep fried cheese crisp .
bad , bad , bad .
salsa tasted like tomato sauce .
took the leftovers home to my teenage kids ( they usually eat everything ) .
the service was terrible .
well that was disappointing .
overheard server say to another table `` was it at least okay ? ''
she may have been drinking since it was happy hour .
oh and the salsa and/or hot sauce is tomato paste .
might i suggest an awesome place ?
this was not good .
the waiter was friendly , attentive , and not a pest .
the hostess acted like a _num_ year old , oh wait maybe she was .
it was a slab of dry pork covered in green sauce !
disgusting .
will not go here again .
food was n't anything amazing .
we ended up ordering some cheese enchiladas with salsa instead of the regular sauce .
here is where the wheels fell off .
ultimately , all orders were taken .
entirely too long for mexican food of any quality .
very bland and flavorless .
the rice was very plain .
the mild taste more like marinara and the hot was just bitter .
pollo rico was dry .
i ordered chicken enchiladas with verde sauce .
service lackluster .
disappointing .
which is so not true !
it did not go well .
i ordered take out , i called in , right ?
needs no approval right ?
i was extremely disappointed .
gilbert will probably just have _num_ .
late sunday brunch with my husband .
the rice was bland .
service was adequate .
i can make a better margarita with bottled mixture .
today was terrible .
it is listed as $ _num_ .
the wait for food is longer than the wait for a table .
they are not equipped for the number of patrons they seat .
in the meantime , he was sat three more times .
another disappointment .
do n't let the location and crowd fool you into eating here .
we were extremely disappointed .
first off i ordered a taco salad and they served it with italian dressing .
it was awful .
gross .
under cooked and way too much sauce .
service is questionable ?
too little too late .
i 'm waiting in the lobby for our pizza as we speak .
i ca n't tell you how cold it was in there , literally shaking .
sadly ... .
i was wrong .
) ; breaded mushrooms .
seriously ... who cares .
i so want to like this place .
let 's just say we ate in silence tonight .
the cheese way overpowered the sauce .
literally just the sauce .
i 've have hotter better pizza from little caesars .
we ordered a _num_ '' mushroom thin crust and some boneless wings .
i could see the crust in some areas .
the food was decent , but nothing our if the ordinary .
my husband described it as a cheese pizza with half jalapeos .
both were drowned in a salty sauce .
we will not be going back .
gave it my usual _num_ tries .
the portions were so small we left hungry .
not going back there ever again .
ugh .
wish i tried a different place .
i lost my appetite .
get gas every _num_ miles and not fill up ?
he took my information and printed my receipt with the friday pick up time .
i really like the area around here .
the apartments themselves are not much to speak of .
i 've had water in my storage closet for about _num_ months .
i 've scheduled appointments and waited hours even after the fact .
had scheduled an _num_ am appt a month in advance .
and i might add , they never asked .
honesty is not something they are familiar with .
shortly after getting my vehicle back my issue began again .
i backed off to get my free alignment .
such a disappointment !
do n't judge me at the counter .
just do n't need it .
they just do n't care .
beans are always bland .
those are awesome and i wish every filibertos had them .
greasy spoon drive thru mexican food .
we 'll indulge in a breakfast burrito every now and then .
my husband and i went there for dinner last night ( drive thru ) .
overall not good !
ridiculous .
horrible service !
the kid in the drive thru needs a lesson in customer service etiquette .
this place sucked .
poor customer service .
so we 're talking _num_ parking spaces dedicated to handicapped parking .
once i 'm finally in i head straight for the shoes .
the shoe department is hit or miss .
there has been a definite decline in recent customer service .
bad costumer service !
this visit was back in november .
- so ... very ... .
thin but not cracker crisp .
most of them just looked dry .
the food took a long time , and the place is loud .
the food arrives and my wife starts looking at the eggs strangely .
there was a hair in my potatoes ( breakfast ) .
no apology .
will not be going back .
no questions asked .
i would not recommend .
liberty market does have a certain down home country feel too it .
i 've been here a total of _num_ times .
huge disappointment !
bad , cold food .
we were impressed with the biscuits and gravy , they were pretty good .
the liberty potatoes were very salty and greasy .
he apologized asked for the bill to go and comp our meal .
had my first and last dining experience at liberty market .
this place really fell off for us with this last visit .
sicilian pizza was awful .
disappointing visit .
we ordered margherita pizza and wet pizza .
i would think that a _num_ degree oven would produce very hot pizza .
could have been so much better .
_num_ dollars too .
not impressed .
you 're seated , you order , you pay , you go .
i was completely ignored .
never again ... .
older gentleman maybe owner , is very helpful to select people .
the toasted pecans immediately fell out .
the place reminds me a lot of joe 's farm grill .
if you decide to try this place during peak hours wear comfortable shoes .
the pizza had a lot of crust and very little everything .
also tried the icecream cookie .
the potatoes were to die for !
well he said that this was almost too hot for him !
his fries were not that good .
the food here is ok .
i will not be returning .
i recommend the food but not the experience .
i have not been impressed with their salads and sandwiches .
the mac and cheese was above average but not great .
it 's crowded and loud and the food is overpriced .
not the most efficient way to get your food .
they just need to fix the front of the house .
and the bathroom setup is not my cup of tea .
my wife has back problems and ca n't sit in certain chairs .
after ordering you go to an assigned table and wait for your food .
: ( disappointed .
all my hip friends said to try this place .
i had scrambled eggs and a pancake with bacon for eight dollars .
wet , gooey batter .
you can not run without paying the bill .
this staff needs massive training on customer service .
so we ordered lunch _num_ hamburger and fries , and a single pizza .
buyer beware .
where has all the customer service gone ?
i 'm so disappointed .
no no no .
oops sectional came from the floor not store room and was defective .
will not even give store credit .
very disappointed .
to her credit , she dug deep to help with fabric selections .
just literally continued to scream .
they will not have our business .
twice we were approached asking which restaurant we were going to that night .
guess not .
never once was it made incorrectly back home in il .
they put $ _num_ charge on your credit card !
that 's ridiculous !
never , never again !
horrible service !
that 's why i want them rotated .
that 's not honest business . ''
they need to change the name of this place to big o morons .
_num_ .
_num_ .
looks like i will be a cactus customer from now on .
my stomach will probably let me know later .
same odd taste again !
i smelled it and not the right smell either .
for all-you-can-eat sushi i 'm not expecting the world .
the spicy tuna roll tasted off .
sushi is terrible .
i would eat supermarket sushi over the place .
i went to this vet back in _num_ .
my gel was terrible .
the second time they did it , same thing happened !
i went originally because the reviews were good .
a fat chunk of it .
terrible .
and continued to file them .
i will not be back !
my tech jumped from customer to customer and was constantly looking around .
worst place ever !
Neutral
horrible .
do not recommend to anyone .
staff was more interested in their group conversation than helping answer my question .
do you usually yell at your customers like this ?
we ordered breadsticks with pizza sauce and a large cheeses pizza to go .
the pizza was gross .
even worse .
i went to the williams field location to eat , but they were slammed .
found a bolt in our pizza !
there was one pizza ready to serve it was ham and pineapple .
worst experience ever !
terrible experience .
and then walked away from me .
horrible customer service !
anderson anyway but this is still a pain in the ass .
not impressed .
pathetic service .
food is very mediocre .
worst blizzard .
first , it 's not free .
this place sucks .
what a waste .
he 's _num_ , and thought it was the coolest thing .
and this little jerk says , how about i just take it back then ?
i asked him his name , and he literally ran away !
worst dq ever .
small town feel , but too cramped .
liberty market is a much better bet for brunch .
very rude people .
we just got stared down by everyone and the servers .
i ordered the long john with mushrooms .
third time trying breakfast here too .
and a sliced potato on the side .
our family of _num_ looked forward to breakfast .
the rudeness was an insult !
dead ?
seemed to be a plumbing issue , the last smell you want at breakfast .
simply unacceptable !
i have the biscuits and chipped beef gravy .
your seating policy sucks .
maybe do n't seat small parties at your large tables .
i tried my husband 's pancakes and they were nothing amazing .
will not be back .
this food was barely edible .
do not go to this location .
drove _num_ miles to get a `` buy one get one free reuben '' .
lucky me because at that point the manager walked in .
really small laundromat .
too small and it was pretty packed .
not to see if she was okay but to yell at her more .
she rang me up without it .
stay away !
seemed ok and i spoke to clark .
is the filet all chopped up and tossed in with the pasta ?
i grab _num_ menus and we start to wait .
this place is crap !
what a disappointment !
it tastes straight from a can or the freezer .
it cost extra for the peppers , mushrooms , and more for the onions .
i was not a fan .
worst service ever !
have tried takeout from this place twice now .
the picture on the website and menu looks oh so much better .
typically my child loves the mac & cheese from here , and dives in .
no complaints .
the french onion soup was a different story , very very salty .
salty , salty , salty .
i will not be returning .
ordered turkey was very dry .
my eating companions also had sandwiches and cold french fries .
this place is horrible !
would n't recommend this place !
our most recent purchase was for a desk that would fit with our decor .
well , all sales are not final .
it 's too bad .
she says this is why she tells people _num_ weeks .
she also says she 'll call us when it arrives .
i bought a couch from them for $ _num_ .
the couch is awful !
employee too worried about eating sonic .
wood furniture is ok , otherwise a _num_ star review .
they really seem to think they are something .
we walked into this place and we were never greeted .
they are way nicer and very helpful .
it felt really depressing .
walked though and walked out .
i do n't get it .
seriously , no flavor .
anyone going more than _num_ stars here is being silly .
do n't expect a conversation however if you are from out of town .
i sat in the shack waiting area and trust me its a shack .
i was terribly disappointed .
not a fan of this place .
went there to do a return and grocery shop for my brother .
with _num_ people in front of me and one behind .
very annoyed .
and would not recommend shopping there .
horrible , rude , unprofessional experience .
would strongly never recommend .
not the friendliest place i 've ever been .
very poor condition .
oh yeah this a tuesday at noon so it 's not packed .
horrible customer service .
not military friendly .
holes pulled out on the greens .
we are three people with six month passes and nine with punch passes .
very gross .
the menu is not as good either .
disappointing food and atmosphere .
dive looking , average cooking and friendly staff .
it could just be so much better !
i ca n't tell anyone to eat dinner here .
did not like tartar sauce .
it was like eating packed toasted coconut .
took _num_ bites .
this place need an overhaul from top to bottom .
it 's the only bacon cheeseburger i have ever not finished .
again ... disappointing .
the bar is ok ... it 's a typical dive bar .
i live down the road and have tried this place a few times .
the food is ok but a bit over priced .
will not be coming back here !
steak came and was still pink and bloody inside .
i wouldnt let my dog eat off the floor .
greasy as shit .
we used to come here once a week probably wont come back again now .
at noon on sunday it was inexcusable .
horrible summer sausage .
only problem ... .
big is not always better .
it really looked very shabby .
everyone there was very , very dissappointed .
my husband and i went to the pumpkin and chili festival this weekend .
the variety grown at this farm are small desert peaches .
since it is a working farm it is somewhat messy .
the farmer 's market store is very expensive .
we were so disappointed .
food was horrible .
very disappointing .
$ _num_ per adult is way overpriced .
not to mention the $ _num_ snow cone .
what a mess !
terribly terribly disappointing .
way way way over priced .
we also do like to support local businesses .
however , this place is a business and is not a charity .
just awful .
did they substitute peaches from the store for the news show ?
obnoxious .
that 's just really overpriced .
the family booked over _num_ weeks ago .
do not recommend this place .
nothing at this location .
what a disaster !
had never been there before was nice .
very unhappy !
lighting ... at night , it is very dark in some areas .
such a waste .
it was our first time there l. tickets are overpriced !
the price to get in is insane .
the food is over priced and not great .
i 'm so disappointed .
i mean , really , homemade yard sale signs to guide you ?
my daughter got a big scratch on her stomach from one .
guess i was wrong .
damn , those pancakes and sausages must be heavy .
will not do it again .
and it 's impossible to have a conversation .
would n't go back here .
this place is terrible !
are you kidding me ?
this place is awful !
might as well shut the doors and throw the keys away !
not in this case .
but we where parked so far away ) .
so she was like ok i 'll need to redo the check .
the egg batter for the chile relleno was literally egg covering the relleno .
the steaks were really thin .
the water tasted horrible .
i will not eat here again .
gross .
unbelievable .
i will not be back .
pick another course , read the numerous yelp reviews regarding customer services .
but , are you ready for the kicker ?
do n't let that fool you .
fine dining experience my butt .
i agree w/ the other reviewers who mentioned the salsa was good .
the chips , though , were a bit too thick for my liking .
very disappointing indeed .
when i got the burros home they were basically all potato .
really weird .
will not be going back .
the property managers are never available to speak with .
the property managers are never available to speak with .
the list goes on and on .
the property managers are never available to speak with .

Positive
i would steer clear of walgreens and use cvs !
i 'm glad someone did their job correctly today .
not visiting this location again .
i have never been late on my rent payment .
i ca n't wait to move !
management is awful .
it 's not that hard .
no such luck .
they did n't seem to care .
feels like due to thanksgiving , shipping fresh fish was backed up .
terrible .
horrible service !
are you joking me ?
i recently came back and the staff is all new .
one word ... rude .
we a group of _num_ were seated at a booth .

not a deal breaker .
i was wrong .
i could n't finish it .
waters were n't refilled .
disappointing atmosphere and disgusting food .
the wait staff was very friendly .
horrible service .
not a place i would visit again .
they charge you for hot tea that tastes like hot water .
annoying stuff .
this place was gross .
i walked out after waiting for service .
every time condescending and rude .
my girlfriend was with me and was like let 's get out of here .
i felt very disrespected .
subway just sucks .
one time almost required me to go to the er .
this place makes me never want subway again .
i would find another gym if i were you .
i have been to gyms with day care centers before .
)
not a fan of this location .
shame on me !
on a positive note , they were extremely polite and did have great attitudes .
however , this is not so reasonable .
but no .
but i had one more stop that i really wanted to make .
she caught me off guard .
makes no sense .
might as well have gone to mcdonalds for a salad , not great .
also , they 're constantly messing up my order .
i know , i know .
i should just stop coming here , right ?
this drove me insane .
no one bothered to care .
i am finding a lot of the restaurants close to sun lakes area suck !
on this occasion we got bagels , scones and cookies for a meeting .
if it was just the scones they 'd probably get four stars .
not like fresh homemade cookies .
stopped in this morning to meet some folks for coffee and it was closed .
the lights were off and the sign was off the front .
unfortunate .
just a surprise to one not tuned in !
accessories are all full price and only expensive selections .
to send a bike out like that is amateur .
no , nothing .
as soon as dad gets better in about _num_ months .
skip this location !
this location is probably the least friendly i 've encountered .
they were rude and unhelpful !
_num_ .
_num_ .
my son fell many times & i never got a report .
_num_ .
chips and salsa for a snack on a regular basis .
totally unacceptable .
it has been around for a long time so some people must like it .
every time i walk in i feel like i 'm not wanted .
i guess ill just have to go back to native new yorker .
bar tenders were friendly , and accommodated everything we could ask for .
waitress sucked !
horrible waitress .
came to phoenix area to get away from the brutal chicago winter .
came in for burger and wings , was one of two tables of customers .
every time i pass this place i wonder how the doors stay open .
very disappointing .
will not be back .
the food was disappointing .
pathetic !
went back last week to have a beer and grab a bite to eat .
this was a nightmare !
he has been there before , and said the food and drinks were great .
would not recommend .
the service was not good .
our server paid little attention to us .
the management appears nonexistent .
the front end manager probably does n't like her either .
a choice of something is nearly impossible because of the size of the store .
went here this past weekend while visiting sun lakes .
the food is just not good .
horrible !
so , he walked out .
not `` looking for free food '' .
there is grease in the air .
no juice .
tea is _num_ % of your business .
steamed veggies were steamed to goo .
fried meats were soggy .
food is nothing special .
disgusting !
third , who cares !
it 's bad .
just stopped for a beer .
it 's like the charlie brown , lucy and the football .
terrible food and terrible service .
ate here recently with a large group .
probably wo n't return .
... no such luck .
completely charred .
the ice-cream was really icy , the crunchy things were rock hard , etc .
we were not pleased at all .
poor quality food .
that 's because i never ate it .
however , when i received my dish the pork was raw .
i doubt i will be back anytime soon .
i 've been going here for more than _num_ years .
ridiculous .
i have use monterey cleaners for two years now .
i would never use them again .
i have use monterey cleaners for two years now .
i would never use them again .
yelp has lots of other dry cleaners who take care of their customers .
it 's a rather efficient machine of evil .
no , thank you .
it 's alcohol based , it will dry in a few days . ''
terrible customer service .
so disappointed .
i feel totally cheated .
i was like wtf !
i dont see the shine i expected with the amount i paid .
do not like this place .
no roof rack polish .
if i could give half a star i would .
your staff was rude .
2nd visit - approx _num_ week later .
3rd visit - approx _num_ week later .
they never vacuum the car like it says they will !
left on the surface ) .
car service bad .
this place is convenient but we we stick to car washes only .
it 's so annoying .
no big deal .
false .
so i drove _num_ miles back to cobblestone .
!
are you kidding me ?
this place sucks .
newly disappointed .
car wash is ok .
when she got home i looked and it was fine almost to the max .
i came back around the north entrance and stopped my car .
still very dusty .
they never explained about this spray wax .
the express wash is the only wash worth doing .
they simply do not care .
hope i do n't miss my flight .
lost a customer !
are you joking $ _num_ !
they put a huge deep scratch in my truck !
they knew it would be several thousand to fix .
had a chip filled on my windshield then a car wash .
went to the toyota dealership to have my oil changed .
terrible `` detail '' .
terrible , awful job .
he stood watch to make sure his own were done .
horrible .
had the monthly payment program for express washes on my last car .
i stopped in just because i was in a hurry .
purchased the ultimate wash for _num_ .
i had a weekly pass for another wash by my old office .
after one wash the tire shine was all over the side of my truck .
the guy drying the car half dried it and left spots all over it .
are you kidding me ?
crumbs and dirt all over .
there are other car washes in chandler that do a better job !
there was a layer of dirt all over the dash and the seats .
poor service all around .
do n't bother .
no attention to detail .
i was wrong !
ok , just another update .
so i was given a a supreme wash coupon from a family member .
are you kidding me ?
i purchased the basic wash and when i recieved my car i was satisfied .
so this is where my issue begins about my car .
which is probably sitting on my driveway .
gold earrings stolen from car today while in for wash !
sent my wife in to take advantage of the coupon .
they said yes not telling her the total price in advance .
they really dropped the ball on this one .
bad and getting worse !
for $ _num_ i would have expected more .
interior windows bad .
will not be back .
not worth it .
big mistake .
usually good , but the last _num_ times , 1-2 star max .
customer service is terrible .
receptionist rude .
very long wait times .
would not recommend .
if they 're not decent i will be sure to add another review .
my husband gave flowers by renee another chance .
walked in to buy flowers for my wife the day before mothers day .
big disappointment !
it looked nothing like the picture .
did my flowers even get delivered ?
so , i am left waiting a lot longer than i thought .
horrible !
worse mistake of my life !
oh i was answered .
horrible .
horrible service !
i also asked for the sugar scrub which was oil and sugar scrub .
again not worth it .
only lasted a week before i had to get them redone .
waste .
needed a relaxing pedicure after a hard move !
worst ever !
only came here because nothing else was open .
i was totally disgusted !
and it 's not complicated .
i need _num_ just for the pizza .
no fork , no napkins .
ca n't stand it .
very bad customer service .
they were celebrating a remodel and having quite a busy saturday .
but i have never been escorted to the bakery .
instead we picked up some doughnuts and stopped at starbucks on the way out .
oh yea , i remember why i quit going to safeway .
i used to love this store , have shopped here for _num_ years .
not good .
we have other choices down here safeway !
never again use this store .
skip this place .
i am not kidding .
you 've been warned !
i told the sales clerk to take a few links off my new watch .
went here during lunch this past week .
i only get tips done .
this place is horrible .
gross !
so i arrived and saw a room full of elderly clients .
i assume they offer some sort of senior day .
polish was not even .
notice that there was nobody else in the restaurant .
she was not pleasant about it .
drive thru is terrible .
unbelievable and unacceptable .
no more !
mcdonald 's down the street will be getting my business .
they could n't care less about the customer .
the worst service ever .
okay ... so i have to write an update because this is just strange .
poorly managed restaurant .
and speaking of the sauce , three words : salty , salty , salty .
even the crust was incredibly salty .
it was not good .
too bad they were .
hit or miss , this joint .
i ordered a pan pizza with pepperoni and it was okay .
my chicago style pizza last night had liquid dripping out of it .
selection is n't too good at this one .
presentation is only ok most times i 've been in here .
i just said ok , and left .
and i 've also never gotten any less than fresh meat here .
the worst !
i will not ever go back .
they rush their work if they have some one waiting .
they only care about quantity and not quality .
Positive
i listened in , and can confirm how polite she was .
no thanks barro 's .
she gave me major attitude so i said never mind .
very disappointed .
i would n't recommend them anymore .
terrible customer service .
i waited _num_ mins for chicken wings .
that 's pathetic .
i will not go back .
probably expected too much ... .
worst food ever .
?
disgusting .
disgusting waste of money .
ugh .
no employee in sight .
i even wandered around looking for one .
this location is really busy .
i 've been a customer of this fry 's store for over _num_ years .
i could not believe my ears .
it is horrible .
no more .
are usually shop on sunday but this week was different .
money , money , money .
its all about the money , that is this church wants your money .
ordered carry out med sausage and med meat lovers .
got home to find a med cheese and med meat lovers .
we ordered delivery for two pizzas and an asiago cheese bread .
went here for first time in awhile .
girls only accepted $ _num_ lap dances on a tuesday !
it 's been $ _num_ always !
it 's not the money it 's the principle !
this was not one of them .
we ended up buying _num_ tickets for $ _num_ .
wtf ?

customer service is bad .
not so much anymore .
worst nail salon ever .
they were rude .
not frustrating .
i had the deluxe pedicure ( $ _num_ ) as i had gift certificate .

$ _num_ w tip for a full set with gel .
i wish i had gone somewhere else .
using low numbers , that is $ _num_ retail for the two diamonds .
i was sent to a gentlemen in the corner of the store .
worst branch ever !
every time i go in , there is a line of _num_ plus people .
be prepared to wait wait wait !
i dread going here once a month .
Negative
okay , the negatives : the negatives all center around price .
i could n't believe it !
but wait , there 's more .
probably not .
what a disappointment today !
bad sign !
the giant one in your face does n't mention it .
the remaining order was returned as cold as it was the first time around .
clean , flavorful , not salty .
really , i 'm not kidding .
it does n't come close .
i got the club sandwich and my mom got the chicken salad sandwich .
all you could taste was the bread .
a real ripoff .
to many deli 's that serve a descent sandwich for the same price ... .
someone could have slipped on the floor .
this would seem to be a fairly serious handicap for such a trade .
i like low prices .
her prices are rock bottom for cheap watch batteries , and simple jewelry repair .
do not trust this jeweler .
the staff are hard to find .
if not , stay away .
disgusting !
ca n't figure out quite what the meat tastes like , definitely not beef .
the manager here by the name of david needs to get fired asap .
worst customer service ever .
he claimed to be native american but i highly doubt that he is .
they were either too wide , or they would slip off .
this might as well be an outlet store .
he tries to sell me an interior detail for $ _num_ .
i was wrong !
complain ?
this one consistently sucks !
not good .
vacuuming was also poor .
will avoid in future .
rude .
i just bought a groupon for a vip wash .
so , this past weekend , it went in .
i got the _num_ basic wash .
not worth the time or money .
rude !
these people are terrible .
your car will air dry before a person touches it .
very poor service .
horrible customer service .
both the scottsdale police and salt river police know this carwash well .
avoid like the plague !
i really want to like this place .
terrible place !
avoid at all costs .
expect average results and a minimum _num_ minute wait time .
this place is terrible .
i would never go back .
so much for my loyalty to az auto wash .
this place sucks .
horrible service .
horrible service .
i put a _num_ pound car on this trailer and moved it _num_ miles .
do n't use this location for anything !
car wash gas station does a better job !
but , yet again , customer service has driven me away .
now i sadly avoid it .
how rude !
there was n't anyone else behind me !
this place sold me two used table lamps .
i went to lamps plus to do some comparison shopping .
the previous place we went spent _num_ hrs with us .
bought _num_ lamps and had to return the other the next day .
do n't stay here .
stayed _num_ nights .
no hot water .
they did not care .
after finally speaking to the manager they get me a smoke free room .
not a word was spoken about my stay .
i have stayed here from time to time .
also they also use this creepy mattress pad as a comforter .
hardly worth a wait .
overpriced ... not all that good .
ugh .
and the kids meals included slices of apples as a first course .
not classy way to handle .
overall , we had a pleasant experience , but the main attraction fell short .
ugh .
i 've learned my lesson and stick to the dc ranch flemings .
my husband and i had reservations for our anniversary last weekend .
not to my taste .
so me and my wife dress up for an awesome night .
so we grab a drink , the bartenders are awesome .
wrong !
i get better steaks from the market .
my girlfriend and i went there this past sunday for the second time .
this past sunday 's experience fell short .
not this scottsdale location .
she normally does this but ok .
im not going back here.
scratch this one off the list .
terrible service- terrible food .
stopped by last night shortly after opening .
i flagged down a guy to bring me some cracked pepper which helped .
for the money , there 's much better restaurants in town .
btw , my last trip to flemings , on ray rd .
not a high end restaurant .
we were in a semi private room , which was nice .
overpriced with mediocre food .
they are all about corporate , not the individual .
i tried the pork chop ( $ _num_ and a la carte ) .
what an awful experience .
she blew me off .
we did n't care !
not even an email .
this place is disgusting .
i have not eaten there since .
customer service is horrible !
i decide not to order from this place .
we then talked about what alternatives there were and decided on chicken fingers .
waste of twenty bucks !
being from chicago , this was the pizza we had to try .
tonight i placed an order for pickup .
i have been using yelp for over a year and never wrote a review .
tonight really was the icing on the cake .
never again though .
we ordered a large cheese pizza , some chicken tenders , and some fries .
the service was awful .
seriously , go to frys and buy your own .
very very disappointing .
price .
a very weak experience .
gross and sad .
this was my first experience ordering their pizza .
at least she has not touched any food that i have seen so far .
whoever the owner is should make sure the workers understand hygiene .
an hour and a half later we calling to check on her order .
so disappointed .
not the end of the world .
third time around - taking down to _num_ stars from _num_ .
terrible pizza .
just terrible .
messy .
we all hated it .
avoid this place .
avoid at all costs !
when we got to the commercial sales counter the employee did remember my call .
it is extremely inconvenient .
lame .
as we walked through i saw a cashier running around watering some plants .
i 'm pretty sure i walked a secret path where all employees were invisible .
this rack had a printed `` _num_ % off '' sign .
we saw the original pricing tags in white and other tags in yellow .
i guess they assume nobody does home improvement on saturdays .
terrible customer service !
not helpful !
and make sure you notice that the credit card interest rate is _num_ % .
once i basically ran into one he was helpful .
i am so disappointed .
customer service is a joke .
hopefully its just isolated to this location .
keep in mind the next closest stores are far away .
no thank you .
your staff loaded our custom doors for delivery and destroyed them .
and i have not spoken yet to anyone who can help !
they billed my insurance $ _num_ $ _num_ of which i now owe .
trying to squeeze money outta people with unnecessary dental work .
very bad experience .
when i picked up my ring , a white gold piece , it fit .
i left with a smile and $ _num_ less in my wallet .
my ring started to turn gold .
gold is not me .
plus , it was confusing .
blue diamond was so convenient for me .
let down enough to never return .
i am rather bummed because this place is not far from where i live .
the chicken taco was pretty good , but again nothing exciting .
their food is garbage .
and it was chewy , like it had been fried some time ago .
the taco meat was cold .
the cheese enchilada was cold .
i do n't get it .
it 's a sucker bet .
_num_ stars .
iced green tea was very yummy .
the third will be explained in detail .
sorta rude .
sakana is another typical sushi place .
the service however , could use an overhaul .
this place is not your typical sushi place .
this place is like american sushi bar .
not a good time .
p.s .
am i paying for the styrofoam container ?
i have been to this sushi place at least a half dozen times .
which was disgusting .
the only flavor that stood out was the salmon .
the service was horrible .
it was mushy and gross .
what is going on with these stellar reviews ?
so disappointing .
ridiculous .
its ok ; _num_ stars for food and _num_ for service .
not worth the value .
it was burnt and soggy .
imitation everything .
imitation crab meat is not real seafood .
a group of _num_ of us went to get sushi here on friday .
terrible service .
period .
it sushi not fine dining .
worse company ever .
that makes sense ... not .
slow !
not a marshall in sight !
horrible customer service !
ridiculous .
wo n't be back .

not sure anyone even cares .
the shopping experience was fine , delivery was another story .
no apology .

they seem like they want to make my experience right .
absolute terrible service .
this is where the _num_ stars come in .
me : `` i need a couple trees for my yard .
i have lawn so i need trees that tolerate turf conditions . ''
ugh .
do not use this company .
ill admit it , i 'm an idiot .
both options were unacceptable .
salesman stopped answering my calls and my questions .
it is just unacceptable .
no call at all .
you 've been warned .
long waits on time for people to get back .
i would not use them ever again .
my companion and i started off by ordering two coffees .
i thought wrong .
scrambled looking eggs with slices of cheese on top .
mediocre at best .
the bakery is extremely over priced for what you get .
a very hard thing to get over , regardless of service or taste .
now i know why they never mention prices on the show .
matzo ball chicken soup was good .
returned with a cold matzo ball to put in the soup .
the food was bad .
my husband order a soup and sandwich and i ordered the jewish sliders .
no apology , nothing .
we will not be back !
now i am speaking of breakfast , i have n't had lunch there yet .
the food was also more or less room temp when it arrived .
so i 'll lay it out like this .
)
poor response !
ill be back tomorrow for some more bagels .
are you kidding me ?
there are way better ny deli 's in town now .
i was extremely disappointed .
it was busy so i waited in line like everyone else .
so i wait , and wait , and wait .
this place is overrated , over priced and over sized !
breakfast on saturday at 10:30 am .
and surprisingly , or maybe not , we got a table for two immediately .
only when i asked for some help , did ray return .
bad choice .
this was a pile of messy scrambled eggs with some black beans .
not one because i would have stated the problem .
and the place was not even that busy .
this place is just ok.
why do they keep the mean old man behind the counter ?
the guy behind me gave up and left .
disappointing .
oh my goodness .
not the most welcoming feeling .
why does this keep happening ?
very frustrating !
not a happy camper , someone better get in touch with me soon !
)
upon first entering , it 's a little confusing .
the menu is extensive , and everything sounds delish .
i also think a little breakfast bar would be perfect here .
yes , but probably just for take-out .
this place is horrible !
the worst service !
_num_ minute waiting time was to be expected .
i expected to able to crunch into my toasted whole wheat bagel .
disappointing .
tomato slices were not ripe .
scrambled eggs were okay .
they should close an hour earlier then !
disappointed .
was getting ready to get up and leave .
very disappointed .
would n't go back .
( two breakfast sandwiches and two bagels ) .
so disappointed !
about half the size of a regular chicken breast .
once seated our server came , rushed by and we were n't quite ready .
average food , average prices , nice menu , busy and good location .
# _num_ -- be careful about having close to closing massages .
the unfriendly check-in .

very poor service .
are y'all paying me for my massage , or am i paying y'all ?
they nickel and dime you .
big mistake .
extremely mushy and not edible .
truly a weird place .
it was cheap at least .
no flavor .
worst customer service ever !

... because she lives off lettuce and has never tried anything else here .
this was obviously put in the microwave , topping and all .
completely disgusting !
food was at best average .
going to houston 's either on scottsdale or on camelback is like throwing dice .
did n't spend enough money ?
but , $ _num_ , for what ?
our party of four met at houston 's for a late lunch this week .
tonight , i just wanted a light snack in one of my favorite places .
we were surprised to see the change in the layout of the restaurant .
the servers are n't exactly the best .
i had the biltmore chicken sandwich which was pretty decent .
seated immediately which was great !
what a terrible experience .
we walked in and the place was jumping .
thanks for trying to kill our evening ms sunshine !
this was n't good .
the greens are even lighter in color and less crunchy .
the fries were disappointing .
yikes , what is happening to a former favorite restaurant of ours !
on average , i eat at ten restaurants a week .
it 's obvious how little you care about our wishes .
the filet in my salad was also very salty .
disappointing .
wo n't be back .
big mistake .
i left hungry and very cranky .
they were horrible .
so disappointing .
houston , we have a problem .
this was really strange to me .
how hard is it to check in like every other waitress .
all the little things that made this place great are slowly going away .
the cheese bread , the chicken tenders appetizer .
typical scottsdale eatery .
hamburger , pork chop , kale salad and ribs .
it was just ok.
$ _num_ on the bill .
disappointed .
i was wrong !
next thing i knew she flagged our waitress down and told her the situation .
my sister offered a bite so i took one off her fork .
we travel , we spend $ $ $ $ on dining out .
slow to bus tables .
the food is always delicious , that is one thing they get right .
the grilled artichoke was on point , though .
tonight it was different .
i used to dine at this houston 's regularly beginning in about _num_ .
the list goes on ... .
i could not eat raw fish .
it was my favorite restaurant .
today was a disaster .
i feel like i walked into a different restaurant .
_num_ and 1/2 hour wait on a tuesday !
my main complaint is this is arizona , folks !
it is _num_ degrees in february today .
extremely disappointed .
she never returned to us outside .
apparently if you order water you must state you need ice in it .
we left and i will never return again .
expensive and bad service .
kids meal not printed .
poor service .
are you kidding me ?
and do those have a collar like a polo shirt ?
no , just those .
we 'll not be back .
i had to take the pants and _num_ shirt out to fold clothes myself .
here 's the thing - i always feel rushed , totally rushed .
however , the place is huge and i 've never waited for a table .
my girlfriend and i met for breakfast the sat after thanksgiving .
i will admit , it 's cheap .
just remember that it 's a cash only joint !
remember , small town feel , big city ?
i know , horrible !
not impressed in the least .
chopped california cobb was a small portion , but good for lunch .
( oh hell no ! )
this is not the case .
ugh ... ... .
the service was _num_ stars .
it always seems busy so tonight we decided to give it a try .
no complaints there .
the egg salad sandwich was ok.
feeling totally ripped off .
bad environment , worse food .
simply awful .
canned , mushy vegetables .
not a fresh ingredient to be found anywhere .
disgusting .
would rather go to breakfast club .
i will not do this again .
needless to say , both my mother and i were shocked by this reaction .
it was gross .
the room was clean and the tv worked .
no closet .
long wait to check in .
i made a reservation here about a week ago .
finally a young woman came out and approached the desk .
it 's a motel _num_ .
this place is a dump !
horrible horrible horrible customer service !
beds hard , rooms clean , but old and needs to be updated .
i would stay really far away from here .

he went this week to get his back waxed prior to going on vacation .

i was about to reschedule when i was found .
the actual nail not just the polish .
she destroyed my nails when taking the polish off .
and the next day the polish was literally peeling off .
i 've been getting acrylics filled for the past year at another place .
waste of money .
horrible experience .

unfair practices here .
why the snobby attitude ?
and they charge more than any other place .

the desk was very apologetic .
i will not stay here again .
we stayed there for a week in october .
next time we are visiting az we 'll find another hotel .
the rooms are drab .
in a resort , i expect atmosphere and a sense of place .
there was none .
i had prepaid for late check out on arrival .
she did n't even greet me .
i hope i never set eyes on this place again .
the service is abysmal .
parking is a nightmare .

shuttles promised for transportation were often very late or full .
they would n't do anything about it .
he never showed , never called .
however , it has been one let down after another since we got here .
however , all the really important features were nowhere near up to par .

a disappointing waste of time .
the `` relief manager '' is a shady character ( lisa ? )
large store with variety but i can get that at another location as well .
long time at cashier check out given there 's usually just one counter open .

which is a shame .
but it was not .
it 's pretty outdated .
my bed was comfy but the hotel itself needs an overhaul .
the walls are very thin .

not so .
they cut portions way down and kept prices up .
not going to this chain ever again !
also , everything was cold .
how did these chairs ( especially the fourth one ) even leave the warehouse ?
ordered pillows in february and they are still mia april 30th .
tiffany prices with dollar store execution .
would not work with them again .
keep in mind there was an $ _num_ delivery fee .
it was like a dressed up gas station bathroom .
i was really excited to try this place today .
there 's a rat in me kitchen what am i gon na do ?
i 'm gon na fix that rat .
when we stepped in , i was excited .
no , dear .
big mistake !
sick .
disgusting ... ... ... .
so tried this place twice on my trip to scottsdale .
they have a large selection of beers , and very attentive staff .
if i can find and entree i like i would bump it a star .
_num_ bites was _num_ too many .
however , i 've kinda given up on this place .
but as i said , i 've given up on this place .
my husband & i have been meaning to try chop and wok for years .
very very disappointing .
the girl who was helping me showed me all the different products .
worse than kmart photography !
so , she wasnt the assistant but the hired help photographer !
tacky !
the _num_ star is for service .
not us .
anyway the sashimi and sushi were fine .
i ca n't stand that .
anyway , its ok .
check it out and decide for yourself .
gag .
the service sucked !
i am a crazy sushi lover !
the service sucked !
gross .
not a big sushi fan but my wife is .
it was dead .
we just ordered basic sushi and had two cocktails each ( _num_ total ) .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
gave me seared yellowtail with rice .
_num_ .
_num_ .
too dark .
they need better lighting .
_num_ .
in the end , not a place to eat sushi .
not true .
they did my landscape plan around _num_ years ago .
which was awful .
not the front door ( very easy to find ! )
on his way there the back left wheel fell off the car !
are you kidding me ?
$ _num_ less !
i even called corporate to complain and they said we stand by our managers .
that would lead me to assume all the locations are the same .
the only information provided was that he had _num_ teeth starting to push through .
all she wants to do is make money .
no sign , no explanation .
but if you pay premium prices you should expect premium materials .
thanks for nothing .
never going back !
very rude .
the answer i got was `` we 're very busy ! ''
_num_ years in business must mean you can turn customers away .
it 's quite pricy too .
so first order with store , delivery was on time .
very disappointed .
poor service !
once i put everything back on the pizza , it was pretty good though .
_num_ minutes late .
i asked for meat sauce and they put regular marinara sauce .
do not get delivery .
terrible !
they were very skimpy on the ingredients .
i took a pie baking class right before christmas .
no reply at all .
i had previously been given a gift certificate that would cover two classes .
zero stars !
to this business .
this is completely unacceptable !
promptly walked out .
i give this place _num_ stars for the overall experience .
everything is about insurance , how you 'll pay , billing codes , ect .
but no .
there is no empathy .
i went in and asked him to bend it back to round shape .
by chance i walked over to zinc where i was seated immediately !
the executive chef should know better !
i 've had much better .
very disappointing .
so disappointed .
food = bad .
i ordered the scallops over chorizo risotto .
he was `` rushed '' through the whole meal .
on the menu it stated the chicken salad had basil in it .
bread is also not automatically brought to the table .
i would not recommend spending your hard earned money here .
very inconsistent food quality .
rather dry .
service here sucks .
items included lettuce heads , breads , and macaroni and cheese .
disgusting .
i 'm not making this up .
not cooked to our liking .
do n't eat here !
we walked out .
will not be returning .
it was terrible .
i could not believe it !
my wife and i had a _num_ o'clock reservation at zinc .
$ _num_ plus .
my wife and i had a _num_ o'clock reservation at zinc .
$ _num_ plus .
the food is nothing great .
haha really ?
the duck leg confit was abysmal .
not acceptable .
the service was just ok.
not acceptable either .
i 've been to weddings where people wore flip flops .
i guess zinc is taking the french thing literally .
went back in august ( for birthday dinner ) .
_num_ % french _num_ % ?
really need better wait staff .
i have had numerous good lunches so i knew what was expected .
and it appears many other patrons were experiencing similar delays .
does not deserve another chance .
this is just another over-priced , trying to be trendy scottsdale restaurant .
do n't bother !
pass this one by .
$ _num_ for a small draft .
guess their rent is high , so they have to over price everything !
really ... scallops and coleslaw ?
tasteless scallops to boot .
doubt the tomato sauce was homemade .
the place is noisy but that 's typical for a bistro .
it 's just too pricey .
was not expecting that .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i ca n't recommend the cheesecake factory .
not a fan .
when we finally got our entrees , they only came out partially .
very disappointed .
this was really bad .
the quality here has hit a low .
did n't even go for dessert .
the only cheesecake which was good was the original .
the problem was the server .
do n't sit at jessica m 's table if you want proper service .
we ate here today for lunch .
got take out since the restaurant was very busy on saturday night .
she was nowhere to be found .
she passed us off to the other girl and never looked back .
bad move .
does n't anyone know how to fry anymore ?
i did n't complain .
but i did not complain .
excuse me mr .
apologies are cheap .
not the cleanest cheesecake factory i 've visited .
she gave my girlfriend a ton of attitude while she was making her order .
horrible service .
not really impressed .
im giving this _num_ stars .
place was loud and chaotic .
silverware covered in old crusted food .
the table was then wiped off , per our request .
next when the strawberries were served , they were very old looking .
the food was subpar , but the cheesecake was good albeit overly sugary .
very grossed out and disappointed .
worst service ever .
i ordered a mexican tortilla salad with chicken .
needless to say , i took my business to another restaurant .
very disappointed .
then they was another dog running around the bar .
once is a mistake .
three times is inexcusable .
be very , very careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap .
i got home , there 's lettuce and mayo and ... what this ?
i did n't finish the sandwich .
disgusting .
not a place to go if you like wraps .
mess .
for the second time in _num_ months , i had breakfast at this location .
_num_ people talking while i stand at the register waiting .
they gave me a coupon for a free sandwich .
i just really wish they would make a change .
i 'm never going back .
most apathetic , borderline rude staff .
there was another person sitting at the desk in front of her .
sorely disappointed .
$ _num_ dollars !
way too expensive !
get your quote in writing !
that 's why i called tuesday morning !
ugh .
no call .
the area is primo , but the situation is not !
it was ok ... nothing special .
just another typically italian deli with italian attitude .
not really .
let 's cut to the chase .
it is also very expensive .
it is gross .
umm ... not so much .
chicken noodle soup was very salty !
i walked in and they were obviously cleaning up the entire place .
not good for the money .
not my thing .
it 's too bad .
he did n't care at all .
worst customer service .
two thumbs down .
ego is expensive .
my son ordered a meatball sub that was served on a hamburger bun .
wo n't be back .
okay never coming here again .
_num_ .
so irritating .
eh ... its an ok place to go .
if i want to buy , i go online .
the customer service , friendliness and attentiveness of employees definitely needs an upgrade !
i was transferred to scottsdale for work and put up in this place .
suffice to say nothing came of this .
went to grab some food from the local gas station because everything was closed .
big mistake .
it was gross .
_num_ ) always book through the hotel .
_num_ ) stay at this hotel at your own risk .
walked into our assigned room and it smelled of smoke .
dark and attendant was creepy .
we get to the room and there is this musty odor and stained carpets .
dirty , dirty , dirty .
it was like hitting rock bottom .
it was like hitting rock bottom .
very disappointing experience .
the salesperson that grabbed my suit said i still owed $ _num_ .
i refused .
then the pants were too long still .
went in to have my oil changed and had them inspect my brakes .
i went in for an oil change and got their _num_ point inspection .
they mentioned i had _num_ % left on my rear brakes .
the employees were friendly , overall , as well .
do n't try and `` pull one over '' on the consumer .
i can get over it , but not too excited about it .
i really want to like this place .
same goes for his customers .
this is where my happiness ends .
stopped in here for a quick bite around 2pm on a weekday .
it was like drinking milk with a lot of sugar .
the service was awful .
those girls working behind the counter were anything but accommodating and helpful .
_num_ .
_num_ .
)
went today at _num_ am .
she had egg whites and ham which was an extra dollar .
was a horrible experience .
ugh .
very disappointed .
i am never going back .
whoever the blonde who claims she is store manager is in this store .
at the very minimum find a sales person that can help them .
i am so frustrated .
i went in to get the foundation that i usually do .
this place is terrible !
when she was finished my hair was short - above my shoulders .
really ?
where , exactly , did she think i was hiding merchandise ?
but they only seem to carry `` old lady shoes '' .
tacky , but not tacky enough to be fun .
what a disappointment !
_num_ stars .
_num_ star .
another one bites the dust .
return factor - an obvious _num_ % .
i mean really ?
i will not go back .
not terrible .
the _num_ stars are for the service and the miso salad dressing .
is what you are looking for .
they were super apologetic , but that only goes so far .
uninspired .
i kept asking for more refills of water to wash my salt down .
they would fill the water up with _num_ percent ice , refill again please .
poor food , poor service .
that 's not chinese food !
the entrees , however made up for it .
all in all , not the best experience .
i am so disappointed .
the bbq pork was yummy , but that is where our satisfaction ended .
so little crab , so much cream cheese .
not good .
however , tonight we had to walk out .
my entree was shrimp with bacon , cabbage , and tomato .
simply could n't eat the food .
another scottsdale fail .
but it was dead !
it was a _num_ minute drive for us .
that had rated several rave reviews , i wonder which soup they really had .
rated it a _num_ .
the restaurant environment was attractive , appeared clean with rather dim lighting .
may be i should stop coming here & look for other asian food choices .
disgusting .
really disappointed .
wo n't be back .
wo n't recommend .
this place is terrible .
i even asked for salt and pepper and never got it .
this place drives me crazy .
they never give extra sauce or more than _num_ fortune cookie .
i went alone tonight .
they brought out two of the three appetizers i had ordered in reasonable time .
did n't see my waiter .
the calamari is tasty but often too chewy .
i ordered the pad thai with chicken and shrimp .
when i ordered it the past _num_ times , it is drenched in sauce .
here 's to a fitting example of why i often hate being in arizona .
no kidding ?
yes , the hotel reeks of smokers .
really poor service .
i put myself down as the main contact for all _num_ reservations .
i stayed here late march .
)
it was weird .
terrible customer service .
almost ruined birthday party .
avoid at all costs .
i gave him my number .
it is now almost _num_ pm and i never once got a call .
epic failure !
we just finished our staycation at the highly recommended westin kierland resort .
our family has stayed in resorts ranging all over the country .
no compensation at all .
not worth it .
golf prices , just too high .
i sat with my luggage in the lobby right near front desk .
only _num_ room was ready .
total time for this `` westin '' experience was well over _num_ hrs .
terrible service .
my wife went online and then called the booking number to make reservations .
disappointing .
buckets of beer contain _num_ beers , lol .
the common walls are obviously thin .
this time ( _num_ years later ) , not so much !
we were so disappointed !
sunshine , food , large pool , family ; seems exciting right ?
the staff acknowledged that my cousin did indeed check into the pool .
i worked at a hotel , i know these things .
associates not very nice .
associates not very nice .
associates not very nice .
not even kidding this really happened .
lame .
really disappointing .
to me , that 's money better spent .
not a rack i will frequent .
really disappointed .
one thing that does keep me coming back to nordstrom rack is the shoes !
none of this is true .
turns out you get coupons that are like cash .
about as effective as test driving a car , but only in your driveway .
did i mention this was is a shoe store ?
not exactly the kind of place you can just help yourself .
did i mention this was is a shoe store ?
not exactly the kind of place you can just help yourself .
i live in san francisco and was visiting family over thanksgiving .
lesson learned for them right ?
thanks but no thanks !
this is not acceptable .
i wont use again .
i would not recommend this cleaner .
Negative
but that was nothing compared to how my mother was treated here .
every time i pick them up they are not folded .
we went for pedicures and they rushed us !
will not be back !
very disappointed .
she does n't honor appointments .
so rude !
not cool !
most likely will not go back .
bad customer service .
do not buy furniture from here !
ugh .
big mistake .
like , overpriced expensive .
i was frustrated .
worst customer service ever .
terrible store customer service .
horrible .
never called me back !
again i mentioned i wanted to do this as cheap as possible .
do not use this location !
avoid this location !
the last _num_ visits have been less than pleasant .
they talk up the waiting room like its the ritz , cold water !
they have a couple of generic draft beers .
the execution was totally off .
the food was mediocre .
i walked into this salon with long , healthy , shiny , well-maintained hair .
exactly what i asked not to have ; and it is orange blonde .
what a complete disaster !
note , picture of hair is after a shampoo , following day .
not professional !
yup , `` _num_ includes delivery '' ?
the ball actually rolls where it should go .
worst customer service .
boy was i wrong !
_num_ % discount for a family in need ?
paying upper management with it ?
workout room is very crowded with equipment .
trying to access your website which appears to be written in korean .
i wiped down the machine before i used it and afterwards .
no way , no how .
those machines need to be attended to and cleaned properly by staff .
other gyms which charge less have clean machines .
she has sales skills to improve if she is going to stay .
yeah , me neither .
not even a hello .
i walked in and looked at all the furniture .
this review is not based off of an isolated visit either .
nothing ... nada .
typical for scottsdale however .
scary store totally void of color .
depressing and dank furniture .
my wife and i stopped by to purchase a bed two weekends ago .
they will ship ( from an unknown location ) but not install .
sure there are things that you order ( furniture lighting etc ) .
customer no service !
it just was n't great .
the chicken and peppers were roughly cut in all sizes .
but for that price , i expect quality .
but i can get better at olive garden for a lower price .
disappointed .
our server replaced my wife 's glass and promptly ordered a rigatoni without chicken .
if it was homemade pasta , i would understand .
obviously the food is ready to go and quickly heated in a microwave .
flavorful , yes , but not spicy as described .
the homemade ravioli were large and flavorful , though .
if this had been our first visit , it would be our last .
i ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo with mushrooms .
unfortunately we were very disappointed .
surprisingly nothing came with the food .
for a _num_ star restaurant we expected better tasting food and far better service .
it was our first time going to this restaurant .
never seen anything like it .
not going back .
this place is terrible .
just consider me one and done .
everything from the bread to `` veal '' is not homemade .
terrible .
trust me , olive garden is a better bet .
service was mediocre to poor .
Negative
it pains me that this place is even listed as an italian restaurant .
had a rude waitress .
do not recommend !
this place is way over rated !
horrible .
she ruined our evening .
made suggestions and was prompt with drinks .
the sauce tasted and had the consistency like a over salted tomato juice .
disappointed !
very very disappointed .
the restaurant has stayed busy because it has little nearby competition .
she was wrong .
and $ _num_ dollars lighter .
i 'm giving _num_ stars because the lobster ravioli was great .
this place is very small which is ok we can deal with that .
i recently went here to have my dog put to sleep .
i knew she was suffering and wanted to end that suffering .
i could n't believe it .
apparently there was some promotion going on and they let me use it .
all my favorite staff is gone too .
recently i was having to take my pet in every week .
i never received updated warranty cards .
bad business .
anyway , spots were still on shirts but they agreed to redo them .
would not recommend to anyone !
however ... my thank you was a bitter one .
these guys are horrible .
unbelievable .
i was drinking water .
these specials that have these restrictions drive me crazy .
just left the arena sorts grill .
however , that it where it stops .
that 's not a chicken wing .
i would not go back here .
it is definitely a cheap sports bar .
and the servers are not `` attractive '' and bitter .
so disappointed .
it was like rubber and very dry .
hard to cut with a fork .
not the great flaky cod that they used to serve .
everything was completely flavorless .
flavorless .
nothing on yelp says they are closed .
$ _num_ cover .
i was very disappointed .
my low review is based on the owner .
i went to this place with my boyfriend saturday night .
then once i get in the domestic beers where expensive .
my chicken was a little too done .
i hate this place .
could n't stand the music .
: ( very sad .
: ( very sad .
_num_ .
he was losing weight .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it really felt like they cared for helping him .
we 've had _num_ dogs in ca .
very bad customer service .
they too seemed surprised by cactus flower 's attitude .
horrible service .
really less than impressed .
not good.
not good .
if you are going to be cheap , at least pay attention to detail .
thier driver must think they own the road .
i met with a sales rep to discuss a quote on wedding flowers .
very poor customer service !
they never sell old flowers just toss them .
missed deliveries .
poor service .
too bad .
their site seems to want to send to only one address per order online .
i dumped the other flowers for my aunt from the cart .
shame !
ugh .
total rip off .
very very sad .
_num_ months later and my pool is in need of repair .
i wish i had used someone else .
no way .
also , they have gone to all serious active wear .
but they are , as all the old ladies waiting at the pharmacy agreed .
the wait time for my rx was about an hour .
understandable bc that place was crazy busy .
repairs cost just shy of $ _num_ .
$ _num_ , really ?
shame on you .
talk about a rip-off !
just went to best buy - same razor there on sale for $ _num_ .
no more !
very poor experience .
they try everything they can to void the warranty .
i suggest that if anyone is reading this , buy from another place .
i really feel like i was scammed by my sales person and her manager .
would i recommend ?
Negative
now for the horrible .
i called in a service request for the repairs and cleaning .
i could n't believe my ears !
we originally ordered them a week before christmas .
almost _num_ months later .
this place is soooo _num_ .
it looked out of place to a humorous degree .
that 's two hundred and fifty dollars .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
okay i contacted james at this ups store .
poor service mediocre food .
bread , meat , lettuce , tomato , some sort of special spread .
i ordered pizza , wife ordered chicken parm .
both sucked .
not real professional .
not cool !
we will not be back .
just the worst .
so nasty and so rude .
seems like the place needs a facelift and new management .
owner was rude .
i have also experienced similar problems with service when dining in .
it was dry , dry dry .
the chicken is better at costco and way less expensive .
i had to put apple sauce on my chicken to make it moist .
worst experience !
this was a saturday night around 7pm , and it was very crowded .
so disappointing .
the owner is rude .
he was loud and overbearing to customers .
too bad ... .
service is pitiful .
they just ca n't fill your order correctly ... time after time .
we walked out .
i ordered linguini with clam sauce .
the clams were not fresh .
the pasta was cooked a proper al dente but under seasoned .
no beers on tap .
no cold glasses either .
we ordered a seafood salad and an eggplant parm sandwhich !
the other half had a _num_ '' piece like the other .
i 'll give it to taste of chicago , it looks the part .
i not a foodie and i do n't watch the food network .
i stopped by taste of chicago this week and chose the italian beef .
never made it to my next appointment .
meets the craving for chicago but not completely .
shame on you guys .
these things were used but sold at full price .
i just will not go back .
for value and professionalism , stick with my sister 's closet .
if you buy here , it might be a good deal .
people should know they are buying nearly stolen merchandise .
my reservation was for _num_ and i was seated almost immediately .
the plate is enough for _num_ , big portions and big flavors .
horrible !
just not good food !
the bread was nothing special .
the water tasted terrible .
portion size was ridiculously small .
would like to see more additions here .
someone at another table asked for it to be turned down .
rude wait staff .
i so appreciate the service and the food .
but - you do n't seat _num_ children in the bar .
which is completely ridiculous .
what a horrible experience .
overpriced as well , they just try and charge you the most expensive deal !
just go to the post office , fed ex or a real ups store .
but i 'm having trouble .
yea fail !
are you kidding me ?
you have been most helpful .
accompanying the meal we chose steak cut fries and asparagus .
extremely disappointed .
by that time my husband and i were 1/2 way done w/ our meal .
not so here .
will never go back and do not recommend .
not good .
i think most appropriately it would be : is everything ok ?
too bad .
another quality restaurant bites the dust .
would not go back again .
the steaks were just ok .
but , she served it anyway .
went there with _num_ others during `` restaurant week '' .
i went here for restaurant week .
all i can is meh .
but i ca n't express how average it was for me .
hands down it was awesome .
for the prices they charge , you would think the food would taste amazing .
setting that aside , the flavor of the steak and meat quality was subpar .
the steak was nothing special .
i got the truffle mashed cauliflower and the bacon onion mac and cheese .
the bacon pieces were very crisp though , so that was good .
poor customer service .
i actually asked `` is this the chocolate souffle ? ''
_num_ ) we chose morton 's for restaurant week .
the morton 's salad and the caesar salad were basically the same .
it was dry and not very tasty .
_num_ ) the stuffed shrimp ... what can i say .
_num_ ) we ordered the creme brle and the chocolate souffl .
note : someone from morton 's called me while i was driving .
i informed him that he is my husband , not a friend .
it 's not appropriate '' .
i corrected him _num_ separate times .
this place seriously needs to learn to respect it 's customers .
obviously he did not care .
soo disappointed .
i could have had a better quicker meal at taco bell .
the sommelier was polite me attentive after we ordered wine .
but not great .
very disappointing .
out of four meals ordered at our table two had to go back .
such a disappointment .
for what it 's worth , i rarely send anything back .
i would suggest more training and also perhaps caring about reviews .
tonight begins arizona restaurant week .
very low ceilings very dark restaurant .
just not my scene .
only reason i would .
blah blah blah .
should you decide to dine at ra .
it was that blah sushi .
_num_ stars .
but i 'm sticking to my other sushi hot spots .
party of _num_ .
one girl is allergic to gluten , so ordered hers wrapped in soy paper .
i 've never been anywhere that does n't wrap in cucumber instead of rice .
why , why , why ?
the reason why it only gets _num_ stars in my book .
turn the fucking music down !
no kidding !
teriyaki is not my favorite but this was alright .
i went back recently with a friend for happy hour .
food was mediocre .
service was terrible .
edamame was terrible .
salad & soup mediocre .
meat was mediocre .
i wandered the restaurant to find someone to refill my tea .
no apologies .
unbelievable .
this place sucks ass .
went there on sunday night to watch game and eat sushi .
so disappointed .
i went here with my friends last night for hh .
first the server only brought us _num_ menu for a table of _num_ people .
slow service .
i was to fed up to wait for my change .
they need to train the staff with better customer service .
my wife and i came here for arizona restaurant week .
no complaints there .
anyway , it was overpriced .
probably not .
the beef short ribs and shrimp tempura were pretty tasty .
$ _num_ for a well martini ?
bad experience on reservation .
it was new years eve and the restaurant was pretty busy at around 9pm .
this is where it gets confusing .
assuming that 's where she wanted us to sit , we took a seat .
since substitutions are sometimes about allergies that is n't super .
management , train your employees on customer service .
guess next time i 'm craving ra i will be driving to old town .
bye bye kierland .
wrong decision .
but not packed i.e .
not off to a good start ra .
but the server we then had was amazing !
more than any other place in scottsdale that i 've tried .
the bathroom was disgusting .
the whole reason we went to ra instead of a different sushi place .
the server did nothing .
each time they forgot a beer , or jalapeos , or soy sauce .
our bill was a little under two hundred dollars for a table of four .
i was by myself so decided to sit at the bar .
no rush sir . ''
disappointed .
went in recently to see if service would be any better .
ill go elsewhere .
dumb .
mr sushi or kona grill will be our only sushi stops .
pretty hard to dye your job when you are so short staffed .
i will visit ra the next time i return to scottsdale .
the late night cravings were kicking in .
let 's just say waaaay too much cream cheese .
scallop was too chewy .
rice was too sticky .
horrible horrible service by danielle .
it 's not that hard !
maybe you need a big window in customer service .
they came out soo dry .
i mean like dry dry .
like it was beef and chicken crackers .
the food is awful .
garbage !
but hey , the portions of it are huge !
went to get gel nails the other day .
only one lives out of state .
no offer to accomodate .
customer service is awful .
this place is not clean !
i left to get two iced coffees to make the experience fun after school .
but that was n't the problem .
i have very mixed feelings about this place .
am i crazy to walk back in here ?
very disappointed !
terrible experience .
was very rushed and not even enjoyable .
my nails were uneven .
not a fan .
_num_ stars for desert nail salon and _num_ stars for tina .
are we serious here ?
gross !
i could hear every sound in the salon during my massage .
haircut : nothing special .
very poor !
would never go back and do not recommend !
my girlfriend and i both used groupon 's for the massage .
first off , the lighting stunk .
bad idea .
seriously , i think the salon has some big problems starting with the owner .
bravo appears to cater to primarily elderly clientele .
my stylist was over _num_ min late .
the place looks old and kind of cheap .
did i mention the sign asking clients to leave their kids at home ?
never going back .
Very negative
first time i had him hem _num_ pairs of jeans for me .
i was desperate so i let it slide .
he quoted another $ _num_ !
i 'm embarrassed .
anything else stay away .
i said forget it and walked away .
went here like a month ago , last time i ever will .
.
so disappointed !
the atmosphere not so much .
not above average , but good for average wings .
clock doctor ruined it .
never mentioned that to me when i got the `` repaired `` watch .
never never again .
i would advise anyone to use another dog grooming company .
now i wish we could forget last night .
food and service was a++ .
my only complaint was the seating and chairs .
they use plastic chairs -- like cheap lawn chairs .
it was just as i remembered .
a cold bean dip with hot chips ?
would n't go back .
i personally believe this place is a bit too expensive .
the sangria had more ice than anything else and was very expensive .
we were seated fairly quickly in some beautiful ... lawn chairs ?
i only wished that the ceviche came with chips instead of crackers .
never going back !
they ended up not having one of the advertised yelp eats entrees .
food is overpriced and not that great .
* _num_ mins into eating .
_num_ mins later .
.
wait my automatic watch stopped working .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the prices remain high .
_num_ .
my opinion on this has been shaped over my last few visits .
as usual i went for mojito monday .
even after this they split the second check so another card could be used .
the paella was really salty and buttery .
fairly forgettable .
we then got bread pudding and flan for dessert .
the bread pudding was so so , but omg the flan was delicious .
would not recommend this at all .
i 'm always afraid to sit down at their tables ever since then .
our entrees were brought out to us .
for chicken , rice & beans .
again , for the price , service should be much better .
was i ever disappointed .
terrible .
terrible experience .
way too expensive for low quality food .
big portions but way to pricy for the food quality .
specially for a $ _num_ lunch .
very disappointing .
it cost me $ _num_ .
this place is racist !
they did n't care .
what a huge disappointment !
the seafood clearly was n't fresh .
it was old seafood .
not impressed at all .
food not that good overpriced .
service not that good .
this place was just eh .
went here last night for our first night in scottsdale for our anniversary .
then a wait , and i mean a wait .
not a hint of red .
went here on a recommendation and because they have home made gluten free pasta .
felt like i was back in jersey , without the good food .
we opted out of appetizers and went straight for entrees .
scratch this one off the list .
it was horrible .
the food was pure grease with cheeses and sauce .
Positive
the food was extremely subpar .
they have a cut away ceiling that looks like an artificial sky .
i considered giving this place another star just because of the waiter .
they really need to look to that .
last attempt was the butternut squash ravioli .
the menu is _num_ % filled with items with veal or pork .
i got a gel manicure and a pedicure last friday .
my acrylics cracked on _num_ of my nails within the first week .
i 've been getting my nails done for over _num_ years now .
not good .
terrible .
wo n't be back .
messy , messy , messy .
what a mistake .
also after less than a week they are already starting to peel and chip .
worst manicure ever !
over priced , and that goes for everything on the menu .
ill give the bagels a try sometime .
prices are inflated ( scottsdale lol ) .
after all , my people wandered around one for _num_ years .
my wife had an ice cream scoop of chopped liver .
the skin of the bagel is soft and not authentic .
coffee is horrible .
nobody asked me .
told the counter person i had never been there before .
they literally walked away without saying anything .
i could have saved some money and just ordered those .
avoid like the plague .
tiny sandwich served on crunchy rye , not steamed .
the bread was more like a cracker , not soft fresh bread .
the pastrami was served cold .
oh well i 'm sure the bagels are ok .
for my order , thankfully she put on gloves .
someone needs to tell the cook how make a reuben sandwich .
a dish i have probably eaten there over a dozen times .
this place is terrible !
i am from new york .
not new york .
food presentation was nothing with nothing .
spend _num_ for breakfast .
go to fry 's buy own ingredients make a better breakfast .
the bagels were just so-so .
a little common kindness goes a really long way .
and i 've only written one other yelp review before .
there is a reason good restaurants do n't carry around computers .
ruth is off in her own little world .
this is not the first time .
we mentioned our concern to ruth the last time .
i do n't recommend this place .
horrible .
the manager was rude .
the absolute worst management .
no stars .
just stopped in for some starbucks and to use the rest room .
the paper towel roller is broke .
their stock is not dependable .
this is short .
8:30 on a saturday , give me a break .
not worth the wait .
the food here is pretty good but not the best i 've ever had .
instead , i came away underwhelmed .
in short , the presentation needed work .
lastly , they only accept cash .
it was cold .
are you kidding me ?
italian chefs i know would be rolling on the ground .
the ambiance of the place seemed nice for the short time i was there .
i got the eggplant parm which is a favorite dish of mine .
the included pasta was cooked to a very nice al dente .
probably would n't come back .
extremely disgusting and rude !
also they only take cash here .
each slice was individually breaded and then baked .
it was crispy and the sauce and cheese made it perfect .
but no more .
what a disappointment .
food was mediocre .
$ _num_ for three .
no wine .
do n't quite get the reviews .
place is tiny and only takes cash .
never going back .
me not spending any more money here .
this was terribly inconvenient .
such a disappointment .
the crab is imitation .
plus cash only to pay really ?
very crowded .
could not even find the eggplant .
unbelievable .
am i going to be looking for a new dentist ?
this time was terrible .
she hates side talk as well .
bland , bland and more bland .
apparently they only flavor things here by throwing cheese on it .
bad tasteless food .
rude waitress .
the decor is kitschy , and not in a fun way .
my two star rating is mainly for the food .
very little on the menu is vegetarian .
there is nothing modern or innovative on the menu .
chips and salsa are my favorite here .
not a lot of authentic or unique types of mexican restaurants around north scottsdale .
after going to this establishment for _num_ years it has officially hit rock bottom .
burritos : chicken inside was excellent .
decor : old and needs a redo and cheesy .
friends insisted on going to ajo al 's last night .
is covered inside and out with processed , thick , gooey cheese .
same menu items from _num_ .
so , so mexican food .
service was a little to hands off .
the service was awful .
the salsa is great but too spicy for some at the table .
the food was mediocre .
chicken had no flavor .
bad service , bad food .
loyal customer no longer .
portions have been reduced at least 1/3 - 1/2 the size .
do n't send your kids to any of their summer programs .
giving them _num_ stars just because the club itself looks nice .
gym equipment was so old it brought back memories of the 70s .
heated pool , big deal can crash a local resort hotel for that .
nope , no mistake .
rude and insulting .
rude and disrespectful .
would not step foot in this place again .
that just blew me away !
i will not come back here ever again .
will not go back !
so , i make an appointment to just have oil changed and tires rotated .
stop by to leave car to get oil changed and tires rotated .
visiting from out of town , i broke a tooth .
and `` why are you staying for two night ? ''
i give him a _num_ star alone for customer service .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
i went to the one on _num_ w. glendale ave # _num_ in phoenix .
absurd !
terrible customer service .
this whole time i 'm waiting in a _num_ degree house .
called on monday to schedule for tune up .
shame on you !
the ac died at our business today and what do i do ... .
i can buy it all day long for under $ _num_ .
compressor will reset . ''
if you have a question do n't be expecting a nice reply .
he was a complete jerk from the minute he walked in the room .
i had to go to urgent care later that day to get a prescription .
this place is terrible .
monty is the owner operator of the store .
very cheap products .
i do n't mind the walk ( it 's good exercise ) .
that 's not fair .
went there today , saturday at 4:30 in the afternoon and they were closed .
i swear to god , i 've never seen anything like it .
not a way to run a music store .
_num_ .
went to ace hardware and easily got the replacement screw without any attitude .
now off to google a better place for lessons .
this is what i get for trying a place close to home .
just like everyone else .
$ _num_ for both ?
meh .
but the salad was all iceberg lettuce .
i have n't eaten here in about _num_ years .
many reasons which were confirmed tonight .
pasta was mushy .
pizza was not so good .
did n't like the cheese .
salty and drab .
my husband had the salad which was decent , but c'mon .
they are the same price for real homemade italian food .
poor service .
service was less than average .
the staffs answer to this was to throw napkins on the wet bench .
terrible service , worse food .
i really thought he was joking , after all is only a olive garden .
today was extremely disappointing .
of everything .
small salad .
entire visit .
another soup .
to our table .
i was highly offended !
a hospital .
your lack of service .
they were not even busy only half full .
terrible service .
all olive gardens are a joke .
soup is basically oil .
ventured away from my normal auto repair place to give this place a try .
the only problem is that nothing is updated .
i scheduled an appointment with the dr .
she did a complete physical exam and spent time with me .
their priority is obviously not patient care .
i 'll miss brittany pa : ( .
i strongly advise you to find another pain management clinic .
i was not happy .
rude !
rude !
rude !
long wait at counter every time i have shopped there .
my girlfriend 's favorite restaurant is red lobster .
yea , i like their biscuits .
but dang it 's gotten expensive for what you 're getting .
and of course , we never had to wait long for a drink refill .
if you 're thinking about going i suggest you sit in the bar .
the restaurant is not designed to accommodated handicapped people .
the bathrooms have heavy doors that are not handicap friendly .
my son had chicken fingers and they gave him _num_ fries !
our honey maple chicken was like leather , and the clam chowder was crunchy !
but no such luck .
recently things have slipped .
too may other places to eat .
the wait staff was just okay .
wait staff just matter of fact about it.
will not be returning .
i have not lived in a city with a red lobster in years .
skip the fries though .
cheddar biscuits are a round heart attack to come .
ugh .
second of all , you had like _num_ entrees for _num_ of us .
salads leave , correct entrees come .
all tastes like greasy , buttery , garlicky goo .
ick .
i had been craving red lobster and took the opportunity on this trip .
the food was pretty good except my baked potato was under baked .
as soon as that was seen our service nearly stopped completely .
i even had to walk up to the bar to get helped .
very sad service .
service a _num_ food a _num_ .
this was my first visit to red lobster .
last eve _num_ of us went arriving before the crowd at _num_ pm .
we were wrong .
could not finish it .
nothing to write home about .
not the red lobster i grew up on .
now red lobster sucks .
it feels like a basement .
what the fuck good is a salad without croutons ?
i cant even watch a damn red lobster commercial .
i should of know better then to stop here .
real crab cakes do n't smell or taste like these .
they ran all over tempe and mesa purchasing clothes etc .
very disappointing !
this store always looks like a bomb went off .
this place is not good .
the interior smells gross .
on my first day i stayed up till _num_ in the morning doing homework .
after over _num_ years with this institution i believe we deserve more !
it was like a family , they cared about you and your kids .
granted , i have only been there once .
maybe next time , i will be treated better .
the casino is a trap on so many levels .
when they talk about a penny machine , they need to mean it .
okay , so that 's a forty cent machine .
sucks .
i will be forever haunted by that image .
i 've been to better casinos in my day , even here in town .
ah , the place where dreams go to die .
avoid .
bingo supervisor was a dick !
a disappointment .
that 's total crap .
at casino arizona the dealers are n't nice and the waitresses are n't hot .
i have not been in the bingo room .
my girlfriends and i went here wednesday night for the crab leg buffet .
smoke , smoke , smoke , and a little bit more smoke .
casino was pitiful .
i leave w _num_ / half theirs and go to wild horse .
casino was pitiful .
i leave w _num_ / half theirs and go to wild horse .
both killing it for a change at slots .
we 've gone to this casino for years , never been this hot .
worst casino ever !
!
out of all the casinos in arizona , this is my least favorite .
the casino itself is small and there are more tables than slot machines .
nice course , but because of the rushed treatment - two stars .
hard , as in concrete .
all _num_ in our party rolled off the green all day .
the green speed was at best _num_ .
they were flat and boring .
what a waste .
all _num_ 1/2 hours .
really this is suppose to be a high end course ?
zero stars ... .
this place is the biggest fucking dump in the entire world .
Neutral
my family has used el pueblo for years .
do n't go to this place .
i see the other reviewers have met the same employee i have .
she was rude and useless .
i am turning them in for these billing practices .
my second time coming here in a _num_ year period .
no complaints .
again , no acknowledgement .
_num_ .
guess what they have not called or written .
as an urgent care , they suffice .
you will see someone else , which has happened to me twice now .
they just take walk in patients .
to advertise as `` urgent care '' is not accurate .
dr. williams is never in the office .
terrible customer service .
terrible experience !
i will drive the extra mile and go to another home building center .
not a lot of money about $ _num_ .
just not from home depot .
continue to be horrible .
this has been my go-to store for quite some time .
not anymore .
long version : came here to make _num_ copies of some keys .
the fish was bad .
the rice was bad .
no brown rice .
almost no vegetarian options .
not going back ... .
had their lunch combo with chicken teriyaki and gyoza .
i drove that far , because i trusted yelp reviews on this place .
everything is over priced for what it is .
i 've had much better other places such as gilbert of all places !
messy on the plate , and difficult to eat .
sashimi was not fresh and the rolls tasted weird .
we only tried the sushi , and we tried the restaurant three times .
first sushi place i tried in scottsdale with my gf .
this place is ridiculous !
this one was a miss .
not a repeat .
sorry for the poor review .
the rolls were a little loose for my liking .
very bad customer service .
no thanks !
bland rolls , no flavor .
tuna was terrible !
we are extremely disappointed !
horrible !
wrote it down on both my calendar and my iphone .
never even apologized .
it was a nightmare .
terrible insurance company .
i got a police report and they still had to investigate it .
absolutely terrible company .
customer service does n't exist .
completely a disappointment .
i 'm not a client of boa and i know why !
find another bookstore to patronize .
bye bye membership card , hello amazon !
disappointing experience .
avoid the starbucks cafe .
instead of buying books my kids spent an hour playing with toys .
barnes and noble sent nothing .
i bought _num_ books , and a word game for my students .

my dog has been boarded and groomed by this store for _num_ years .
i use to bring my dog in all the time to be groomed .
we have been having our various dogs groomed over _num_ years .
pathetic .
not impressed .
remember , the other _num_ were elderly .
`` look , i am looking for my insurance card '' .
this is really a _num_ rating .
they never refunded me a penny !
this drive thru pharmacy needs a lesson in customer delight .
just completely unprofessional .
horrible check out .
so sad .
the panang curry was loaded with onions and the beef was seriously chewy .
for my entree i ordered a yellow curry chicken .
my boyfriend ordered the yellow curry and i ordered the pad thai .
mediocre , forgettable experience .
that 's really expensive for tilapia !
not impressed with this location .
this is going to hurt all the other tenants in this shopping center .
are you kidding me ?
guess not .
no thanks .
low low low .
i always get the cheese steak on wheat .
it 's very sad .
ok , well you should learn customer service and building maintenance you jerk !
nothing special whatsoever .
it even looks like the wings are assorted sizes .
Negative
never received the appetizer , never had my order taken .
the cheese was nonexistent .
as for pizza , it is your basic bar pizza .
gone but not forgotten .
ca n't believe it .
oh yea , you have to try the chocolate cake !
walked in with my hungry , thirsty children .
run for the hills !
horrible experience !
horrible office visit !
ridiculous , i say .
this is my first time going here for an alteration on _num_ shirts .

find someone else , anyone else .
bad dr , bad staff .
horrible service .
really horrible service .

its actually really gross .
( just close your eyes and imagine a bowl of oil .
ick . )
terrible food .
terrible management .
terrible time .
the night started off normal .
the drinks were brought first and our dinner order was taken .
nothing seemed appetizing .
however , other than that , stay clear .
i wish they would come up with more new menu items .
i 'm trying to give them a chance .
ugh .
we ordered a standard burger but wanted beef rather than turkey .
manager never visited until after we got our food .
very disappointed .
dirty smelly nasty !
it was uncomfortable and irritating .
it was my favorite place and i never had any issues until tonight .
`` shit food '' is not a swear mr .
i almost feel guilty writing this review while using their wifi ... almost .
my bad .
what a horrible attitude !
i tell him i 'd like to give him our feedback .
the wings were fatty and had very little sauce on them .
the arcade stole $ _num_ of our kids money .
at best , this place is a drinking hole .
i would n't eat there .
truly unfortunate !
they have alot of nerve and frankly i do n't need them .
not recommended ever !
extremely rude front office .
this gym ... is ... not exactly ideal .
and then , there 's the saturday exercise classes that change instructors every week .
not a really challenging workout , but amusing nonetheless .
bad business .
disgusted with this place .
first of all , this location is impossible to find .
this place was terrible .
everything in our apartment was in need of repair .
how rude !
that being said , i would proceed with caution when considering this provider .
it 's unacceptable .

today , is sunday morning & _num_ of my nails have already chipped .
worst experience ever .
hurt like hell .
this place is horrible .
i tried this place for the first time .
rude staff .
worst service ever .
staff is friendly but the quality of the food just does n't cut it .
this is the closest chipotle to my house but it is the cheapest one .
i feel like i have to beg to get a decent sized burrito !
terrible experience !
and for a _num_ night stay thought they would provide more soap and shampoo .
steve offered the use of another pool _num_ miles away at another property .
as getting in your car and driving to a pool is so convenient .
i called nick as steve was off that day .
a major inconvenience for everyone .
this place is ridiculous !
_num_ noodles .
i will not be going back .
do n't ask for changes or ask questions , please !
took it home , tiramisu , will taste in the am for breakfast .
fifth person had the meatballs , said they were good .
appetizers muscles were good as was the soup .
when my bowl of pasta arrived , it had all of the above .
the waiter did offer to get me a third bowl .
service was slow .
extremely slow .
disappointed again .
the highlight of the meal was the bread .
party of _num_ .
did n't refill drinks .
so , she placed another order and sat down to wait .
then he asks me if i want to place an order to go !
the kitchen that was utterly chaotic .
for the money , there are plenty of other italian choices .
the only `` acceptable '' meal was the chicken marsala .
do n't recommend it .
never going back !
( will not return ) .
)
they are ugly !
my husband , son , and i ordered sausage .
my husbands was a little pink .
will not go back !
horrible service .
horrible attitude waiters .
food poor at best .
this place is awful .
that 's why few cars in the lot consistently .
very disappointed .
bathrooms smelled horrible !
chicken was weird looking though .
anyhow , we were seated immediately and greeted by our server .
first the mac and cheese bites .
essentially it was just melted parmesan and mozzarella .
not warm .
but cold .
my boyfriend 's cheese ravioli were still frozen on the outside .
if anything , you should be speaking with your back of house staff .
terrible service .
very disappointed .
bad service .
gross .
food was not good .
so salty and bland .
i would give them _num_ .
oh he just showed up with bill !
worst service ever .
i suppose the macaroni grill drops off of my favorite places to eat .
prices are up , quantity is down and quality is down .
and $ _num_ bucks for a small so-so pizza .
they also apparently need managers that know how to run a restaurant .
the reviews at all locations are low .
very poor food .
you could only taste garlic .
kind of gross .
the couple did n't argue , just left .
they were extremely unprofessional .
very rude .
although the pancakes are excellent , the breakfasts are overpriced for what you get .
once she served the customers , she would play cards with the cook .
i ordered an egg white omelette with vegetables and a side of buttermilk pancakes .
the omelette was terrible !
my omelette looked more like scrambled eggs sitting in melted butter .
i could n't finish more than half .
my boyfriend ordered blueberry waffles and said they were decent .
but , here goes .
i 'm gon na keep this brief .
husband and i went there for breakfast on a sunday morning .
_num_ am on a sunday ?
my _num_ year old could have done better .
this owner chad is a jerk .
$ _num_ for _num_ egg .
nothing special .
the food is pricey and rather average , with very greasy bacon .
there was one man waiting tables and two more in back .
is n't that a rule ?
it did however , come out quickly .
very disappointing .
impressed with a cheery hello as soon as we walked in .
the reviews were pretty mixed .
my waffle was nothing special .
the potatoes in it were still hard .
thank god i went with a groupon .
they responded no .
this restaurant is terrible .
no explanation .
next my daughter ordered their specialty , the banana strawberry pancakes .
avoid this place .
the wait was longer then needed to be .
i 'm so disappointed .
but not memorable .
gross !
i would not recommend this place .
my raspberry pancake was ok.
kind of small portion for $ _num_ .
big mistake .
purchased a groupon and even waited a month before trying to redeem .
i have been a long time groupon customer and have never seen that before .
in general my husband and i leave _num_ % + depending on the service .
_num_ minute wait to take our order .
this place is horrible !
we had a groupon too like so many other reviewers .
i was so angry !
very disappointing .
main course : i 've had better meals camping .
i went for az restaurant week .
they were very willing to make dietary substitutions .
overpriced for mediocre food .
nothing blew me away , except my company .
plus desert is to die for .
i 'm very disappointed .
the food tasted only like the oil and batter it was fried in .
the restaurant was not even half full .
$ _num_ per person .
i was thinking to tell my friends to try this endless fondue at first .
my daughter was in a group of _num_ kids going to dinner for prom .
kids were disappointed !
my husband and his buddy had one drink and then were cut off .
anyway , it was kind of a bummer for my birthday .
she kept trying to upgrade us and was very short with us .
horrible service .
stuck up , snotty .
rude staff .
never plan on going back .
while the food was good , the prices are ridiculously inflated .
$ _num_ is half my weekly budget in groceries .
none of these available .
service was awful .
i asked management and they stated ownership is trying to do things different .
the service was annoying .
i expected so much more from this restaurant and was let down .
not a fun and interactive experience at all .
that 's just wrong !
on the choice of cheap vegetables to accompany the cheese .
just very sad .
written to warn others .
i give the food _num_ stars tonight .
if you go and they say johnny is your server request someone else .
mediocre food .
bad service .
= $ _num_ .
wrong !
the service was really professional and nice .
it was comparable to airplane food .
had a reservation for _num_ people on easter .
after we placed our order he brought out the cheese and the dipping sides .
i would not recommend going here .
it still looks like i cut my own hair .
prices totally unreasonable .
i could n't stand being there .
the machines are disgusting .
do n't get a pedicure .
the staff is polite , helpful and knowledgable .
rude sales staff .
she called me to the window later to advise they were running behind .
i can not comment on her actual diagnosis .
very busy place .
maybe some vegetables .
you ca n't just buy a side of chicken breast .
there really is n't anything special about this place .
it 's grilled chicken , beef or salmon over rice .
the previous owners took so much pride in their food .
not it 's ok for a change .
franchise owners should be held more responsible .
wrong !
is this brain surgery because everyone acts like it is .
worst .
she did n't even try .
ridiculous .
the two associates working were christine and tony , i believe .
major attitude the entire time .
without a bad attitude .
f @ ( & this place .
go figure that this store only has _num_ star ratings .
i needed to change my plan and they suggested the edge plan .
no surprise there .
thankfully , this is what ended up being done so i appreciate that .
i just cant take an hour and a half for lunch .
bread is cheap .
manager did not do anything .
the urgent care doc ordered a ct scan and referred me here .
not respectful of your time .
very disappointing !
they only except one form of payment which is visa .
the last time i was there , they were trying to overcharge me .
so why didnt you call to let me know that before i came in ?
are you kidding me ?
i had a procedure done in december _num_ .
horrible customer service !
horrible !
( it looked as though it had been caught in a machine . )
also i have appreciated the sunday pick-up hours .
no call .
the texture was seriously damaged .
i am standing here as i write this .
they ca n't figure out how to use it .
i get it , businesses are busy and i was okay with that .
there just were n't many options to be had .
this was my first and most likely last time i visit this chain .
it was a rather confusing sandwich , shall i say ?
it 's too thick for me .
very slow .
shame .
shame on you .
how ridiculous !
it is my understanding that tuscany is under new management .
not a fan any more !
it was not real flavorful .
it did not have it .
i should have sent back the meal and walked out .
the chips and dip were awesome .
problem was they forgot alot .
probably not .
very bad service tonight !
tonight ?
terrible !
she does n't belong here !
no class !
no customer service !
no comments !
so , take their sign with a big grain of salt .
the chips & salsa are better than most .
in all , i 'd only come back for the chips & salsa .
then it was downhill .
terrible !
so i walked out .
the restaurant was dead .
-i will never be back .
tonight was an exception .
the mild salsa was very hot compared to how it normally is .
normally i almost drink it an put it on everything .
granted , it did come out quickly and the goods was good .
not many patrons in the place .
ate there at lunch .
shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada lunch combo .
cheese enchilada was ok.
at least it was hot and cheese was melted .
i will wait an hour after my apt time just to see the vet .
ridiculous .
a few years ago this store did help us with a dog having problems .
it was ridiculous .
so , i left .
well the emergency facility was closed due to regular vet facilities being open .
my dog is everything to me and he 's _num_ now .
not the time to have your vet get flaky on you .
so me and the mr are knee deep in guest room remodeling .
someone should punch that little red head bitch in the face !
_num_ ) my _num_ year old was served a raw cheeseburger .
they walked this cow right through the damn kitchen .
this parking lot sucks .
there is none .
once i got home i opened the bag to eat my food .
_num_ .
polish so thick i have air bubbles on every nail .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
honestly , the meat patties where really thin .
no juicy beef patty .
no like !
so i 'm spoiled .
definitely not a fan !
i would not go there again .
rude and unhelpful .
that is not cool .
not like i remember it .
horrible restaurant .
trust me , you dont want to bring your car here .
i am telling you , you will regret it .
talking to their management does nothing .
seriously , you do n't need to go here .
ridiculous .
not a fan at all !
first , im in phoenix , not nv .
broke down again the next day .
and buy another used car .
my neighbor had taken her car there several times and said things were taken .
dirt left on wheels and bumper .
just recently had my car washed here .
but do not wait there .
abandoned soda fountain .
i had been taking my kids to this office for _num_ years .
that was my fault .
lastly , this place is not cheap .
not a good value at all .
no thanks .
be careful of hidden charges ( very small print ) for parties .
under new ownership and the prices have gone through the roof .
rip off !
and i could not stay .
you are hungry , thirsty , not mention the day before prep .
yet , the staff did nothing .
check out all the complaints on the internet about trend time toys .
scratch my last review .
no way , jose .
hey , al , feel free to comment .
trader joe 's sales out of a bottle is better .
i would still like to try the mushroom enchilada .
in fact , the food was even better three days later as leftovers .
do n't ask why , some food is just like that .
they replaced the salad and still charged me for it .
my husband 's family has been going to this restaurant for quite a while .
not anymore !
not great salsa and not a lot of options for the vegetarian .
oh well , ok place for a quick lunch .
my first visit to ajo al 's .
i ate here and was in the bathroom three times .
would n't recommend to anyone .
walk into the bar and sit down .
no bartender ?
we were so disappointed .
wow -- terrible experience .
appalling .
plus no music etc .
so bizarre .
horrible customer service !
they seem very unorganized .
they sometime even blew it off completely !
this is just to name a few problem that occurred while renting from them .
the interior amenities were very cheap .
the cabinet doors would frequently come off .
i would not recommend this place .
i guess i just did n't get it .
i can see extra for avocado or bacon , but not the basic veggies .
its disappointing .
i walk up and her greeting was `` what do you want ? ''
first impression : not so great .
i ordered half a roast beef sandwich with a garden salad .
zero stars !
this is a fifteen minute appointment factory and i was nothing but a number .
bad experience .
never called me .
too much work .
he told me to c , which i did .
he was so hyped up like he was on speed .
it is pricier than other places i have tried before .
i will not be back .
this place is close to my office , but i 'd never been before .
for $ _num_ - basically scrambled eggs and a flour tortilla .
not really my cup of tea .
i am surprised by all of these great reviews .
no comparison whatsoever !
we agree with others that the bagels are average , definitely not superior .
never mind the customers i guess .
not overly clean and not much attention given to the ambiance .
you can get better nova at costco .
you 'll be disappointed .
i swear everything else goes up _num_ every time we visit .
ugh .
not impressed by this place .
this is too far from it .
no thanks .
then they proceed to change my order .
it 's not mcdonald .
Neutral
how many times can you fuck up an order of two eggs and sausage .
not a good sign .
we will not be going back .
even with a coupon this place is expensive .
strike _num_ !
in fact , there 's nothing really `` good '' about this place .
arrogant and rude !
worst service ever !
the interior of the restaurant is your typical sports bar/restaurant .
the wooden booth was slightly less comfortable than a park bench .
in reality , i was there because i was hungry .
nothing like focaccia bread .
not good .
beer was cold .
terrible customer service !
i had some drinks and appetizers , one of them being some wings .
i also i feel the beer should be cheaper .
i ordered a focaccia with balsamic sirloin , mushroom , onion , and cheese .
service was incredibly slow .
that 's not ok !
not anymore .
worst place ever !
gross .
truly rude and definitely incompetent .
i 'm not making this up .
this place is terrible .
the first sip was like drinking a sugar mix .
it was not focaccia bread .
we asked her for more mayo and she brought out honey mustard .
not appetizing .
so , my friend and i payed the bill with our money .
my boyfriend is nicer than i am .
no major complaints .
not a big issue .
my wife , however , ordered a chicken club .
not dark brown , black .
she sent it back .
tasted sour , almost as if the oil in the fryer was never changed .
and also their breading is dark before they cook the patty .
the service was awful .
apparently a lot more difficult than i thought .
i was a loyal customer for over _num_ years .
_num_ .
_num_ .
you can not sleep .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i have seen worse .
Neutral
ok , next appt .
i get back to see dr .
they cancel _num_ hrs .
it 's 4:30 apt was at 2:00 .
_num_ patients ahead of me .
there are far more doctors with the same level of experiences .
not a feeling you should let your client 's feel .
there are so many places out there , you should be fighting for business .
for money not a very good deal .
course was ok but nothing special .
worst experience ever .
company in at night .
they are horrible !
this was the place for me !
annoying ... .
however , for the longest time the back pool was closed !
not here .
the other $ _num_ is theirs to keep .
a majority of these problems are maintenance related .
you probably slammed the door , be careful next time , dont do that .
dont they have a fix it guy for issues like this ?
at night you can sit by their nice large fire pit in comfy seating .
_num_ .
the staff was not very friendly .
_num_ .
_num_ .
we recently started taking our cats to this vet .
i recently adopted another kitty to keep our younger kitty company .
this was _num_ weeks ago .
however , his office over billed me .
that 's ridiculous !
i guess that 's the only decently priced item .
$ _num_ ?
run fast and far to another cleaner , any other cleaner !
i could have replaced multiple pieces for far less .
my wife had the same experience .
if you want a dessert latte go to mcdonalds .
terrible service , mediocre food !
i did n't even finish it .
as chart house locations go , this one is hit & miss .
this was so bad !
_num_ .
service was exceptionally slow .
_num_ .
poorly trained servers .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
lobster portion was skimpy .
_num_ .
and i have never done that in _num_ years of dining out .
but this place charges too much for the applebee 's style service .
staff was awful and worthless .
shrimp was cold , salmon was cold , fries were cold .
three diners sent their plates back .
not hot .
the waiter apologized , the manager apologized .
the macadamia crusted mahi was simply so-so .
portions small and seafood not its freshest .
the food was overpriced .
house takes tips from waiters then charges you again .
be sure to check your receipts .
will never return to this place .
gross !
did i mention that it is march in phoenix and _num_ degrees .
that being said the discounted our $ _num_ bill by $ _num_ .
i could have a better salad at super salad .
holy mother of god , this place ai n't cheap .
well , i 'm signing off on this joint .
the appetizers came out but not b & b .
we were seated and our server joe took our orders promptly .
after finishing our salads , they brought out our entrees .
nothing to write home about .
we were seated and were given menus .
the mashed potatoes were cold .
my mother-in-law found that her crab cakes were overwhelmed by the accompanying vegetables .
the worst part ?
chart house sucks .
horrible experience .
the caesar was drenched in dressing and not tossed .
the others were mediocre .
the macadamia crusted shrimp were good , but very tough .
i have experienced much better meals at red lobster for much less money .
attitudes are awful .
)
it seems the staff would appreciate it if you did .
for the prices they charge , you 'd expect top-notch .
my _num_ yr old could 've made it better .
presentation was bad too .
they are basically average dishes that are significantly over-priced .
do n't think so .
that 's an extra $ _num_ .
disappointing .
this was not the case .
we were very disappointed !
nothing to write home about .
it was an odd mix of bridge club and bar star .
my last visit we ordered the artichoke dip with chips .
you really want it to be better than it is .
years and omg too much plastic surgery over there !
she just picked up menus & said , `` this way . ''
our server was fabulous but that has n't changed my opinion of this place .
very disappointing .
just from the staff not knowing how to treat customers .
terrible !
so i wrote them a check for _num_ .
i went into the store and was greeted by a really pushy sales lady .
i would not recommend this place !
will not be back here again .
so why ask me if it 's ok ?
this was unacceptable .
no excuse for such poor service .
i 'm not sure what happened there .
i 've had better reception from the front desk staying at a holiday inn .
avoid .
beds not as comfortable as they should be .
poor .
hyatt trying to save money ?
beds poorly made .
but this imho is a management issue .
not inexpensive .
the staff are friendly but not so helpful .
the food is pricey and not really worth it .
the resort seems extremely understaffed .
i am a hyatt platinum card holder ... .
spent two nights here and checked out early .
for $ _num_ a night we expect much better .
just weird .
no wings .
this was the only gem of the place .
but the real reason for my _num_ stars is my room .
after all , my wife 's company was picking up the bill .
$ _num_ in camera gear stolen from my room .
they charge for parking .
my neighboring rooms were the ones they apparently use to accommodate people with dogs .
speaking of the room , it in itself was fine .
but no customer service .
called to confirm down free room .
a room with down pillows and down comforter !
in az no less .
completely ruined our staycation !
completely ruined our staycation !
i would think twice about booking this again .
at $ _num_ a night i was expecting organization and class .
i spent thousands of dollars on his meds , blood tests and monthly visits .
cold .
anyways , should have tried someplace else .
it was mediocre .
my experience was terrible .
i had two separate orders because i was ordering for another co-worker as well .
it was okay tasting and a little on the cold side .
i will not be back .
so we are staying at a local resort and called for a delivery .
pork fried rice bland .
is n't rice cheap ?
this place is hit or miss !
the driver called me two different times for my address and cross streets !
they gave me a _num_ % discount and that was it !
ridiculous !
very disappointing .
literally over _num_ hours .
chicken was over fried .
delivery person was not friendly .
just nasty .
the food is `` average '' and there is n't anything special about it .
when we pulled up the driveway to check in , it seemed promising .
there were lots of trees and flowers , and everything looked really clean .
so , you ask , were there any positives ?
otherwise , avoid it .
seems like anyone can get a _num_ star rating .
shame on you .
parking was a disaster .
the hotel itself had character with an old southwestern decor .
i 've stayed here several times over several years .
( more thoughts on the resort fee at the end . )
_num_ .
_num_ .
if the fee is per rooms , it should be built into the price .
the beds were not comfortable .
came with chips , fried potatoes and something else i ca n't recall .
cell phone reception was totally gone .
i use sprint and heard that overall sprint in phoenix can be very spotty .
the bathroom was outdated .
did n't seem like management cared .
plus the spa is very small .
pita chips are crunchy .
food arrived quickly and it was hot .
so , overall , the experience was alright , only .
the groupon deal cost $ _num_ so i was expecting more for the price .
not pleased at all .
we did sleep very well for _num_ nights .
the staff was relatively nice but inept .
avoid .
the rooms are dark and dingy with low ceilings .
i booked this hotel on hotwire .
star rating is wrong .
rooms are very outdated .
hotel not clean .
that 's why they call themselves a resort i guess .
gross !
this is disgusting and unsanitary .
furnishings in the room are old and should be updated .
the hotel claimed nothing could be done .
this hotel needs to be sold and have a complete makeover of the rooms .
do n't let the pictures on their website fool you .
)
horrible customer service .
rooms are quite dated .
what the hell ?
i walked in .
no one .
the linen closet has a big freakin heater tank in it .
the neighbors water leaked and left spots in the ceiling as well .
it was recommended by the staff at the hotel where i am staying .
i think she got nervous , maybe he was rushing her .
will not be back .
taking my business down the street .
i have never experienced this reaction to anything before .
nasty .
disgusting !
they charged me without asking and charged me for two .
terrible .
probably all beef but who knows .
maybe left over from the day before or frozen ?
so i turn to yelp to let others know .
they spend tons on these commercials and then drop the ball .
they said they only make _num_ muffins in the morning .
if you are running low , then make some more .
terrible customer service .
this is a bit obvious on almost every employee here .
totally disappointed !
there was a little salad of dressed greens on the side .
totally ruined my day !
hate this place !
being from nyc i 'm very biased when it comes to chinese food .
the shady practices come in when i placed an order to go .
total , $ _num_ .
not cool .
like my grandma used to say , `` soap is cheap '' .
the food is barely mediocre .
if this is an improvement , their old one must have involved punch cards .
it takes forever to run a deposit , even a single check .
Positive
- their email does not work .
professional , eh ?
this is ridiculous .
i refuse to deal with them anymore .
cash for coin though ?
i 'd really like to give them a better rating .
his staff did register me .
customer service fail .
only then did they pay attention .
but i find myself ordering more and more stuff on of the internet .
customer service is garbage .
but i guess with all the people using its bound to happen .
thats were the good stops though .
so maybe that is another plus .
i 've taken friends and family there to shoot .
they are high priced so that is a little ding on them .
then in october ( _num_ ) , i was double billed again .
he came out and i explained the situation and showed him the bill .
in full disclosure , i have never actually been to the scottsdale gun club .
my husband went with a buddy before christmas , and talked about a membership .
i tell him i want to check in to the range .
so i left .
that 's too bad .
mike , ( tall skinny guy ) .
the selection is _num_ stars imho , but the customer service gets _num_ stars .
`` you 're not worthy '' just about sums it up .
this is a typical scottsdale establishment .
open _num_ days .
aside from that there is nothing positive about this place .
consider me a former customer .
picked the cupcakes up and i could 've done a better job at home .
wish the bakery could get their act together .
completely unnecessary .
buying organic milk is also a hit or miss .
is it really that difficult to manage inventory ?
do n't employee get trained ?
the night staff could use some customer service training .
i found someone to shut the alarm off .
she would not return my calls .
so i dropped some of my towels off .
uh , stealing dirty towels ?
not anymore .
also , the clientele is getting more and more questionable .
unbelievable .
they turned out terrible .
things go to where they need to but even that was confusing for the .
i left in a hurry and submitted a complaint on line later that day .
little respect for your time .
terrible .
terrible !
i needed customer stickers for an award board asap .
horrible customer service .
rude and very unprofessional .
so _num_ would be past due by _num_ days every month .
just like another shoe place i reviewed , it 's a hit or miss .
this time it was a big miss .
by the time i saw it it was permanently damaged .
i walked in and was paired with an available salesman on the floor .
but ok , not a big deal .
i put my phone away and went back to looking at my options .
so he continued to stand by me as i looked at the selection .
such a rip off !
terrible service .
later i realize the food he was giving them was my food .
okay , so lets talk about what matters , service , atmosphere and food .
that gets _num_ star from me .
this place is comparable to buca di beppo .
not surprising - so in my opinion , therefore not interesting .
if you 're craving a good pizza try grimaldi 's .
as of now , oregano 's just makes me crazy .
my coworker and i were greeted warmly by the nice host .
i read a review from derek m and i scratch my head .
on my second visit , i ordered a meatball sub , again .
i could have got a better meatball sub at subway .
bad !
once we ordered bartender really never noticed us again .
i do n't get it .
i 've gone to various locations - phoenix , tempe , shea blvd .
okay , maybe not , but it should be there .
more than _num_ .
each time i go there are flies everywhere .
so gross .
i do n't get it .
at this point i should have walked out but i did n't .
hmm i guess we could have ordered the chicago style pizza after all .
so sad .
so i just ordered a bottled beer .
this review is only for their stuffed pizza .
this pizza is not good .
sauce is unremarkable .
i hear that the thin crust is better .
worst part ?
we were very disappointed .
zero stars not allowed .
same thing with my gf ( she got the small salad ) .
i would not eat there again .
i went there with my fianc and his daughter last sunday .
if we compare the bill at oregano pizza they charge too much .
i was so excited to meet my friends here for dinner .
an appetizer which had to go thru the oven .
another person sat another table and again walked by the pizza .
it looked bad !
the buffalo wings were pretty good but needed more sauce .
speakers that sell for _num_ are priced on amazon for $ _num_ .
hell no !
my first encounter was with the audio express off of bell rd .
so we rescheduled a new date to get my vehicle completed .
we could n't get it .
and sent me on my way with my car safe and working .
i called _num_ different establishments .
told me other establishments do n't install this part .
taking my business elsewhere .
finally i get my receipt it shows the price _num_ .
not too happy with the sales side there .
this is a humongous walmart .
made a stop at safeway and requested a transfer .
miss amy placed me on hold .
ill pay your .
a few weeks ago i ordered a custom photo blanket through the photo center .
not everyone gets customer service .
normally okay , but my wife needed her clothes for _num_ am flight tomorrow .
that 's bad service .
never doing business here again -- so much for supporting the little guys .
horrible customer service !
filing in small claims court this week .
the massage itself was better , but not by much .
i 'll call you back later . ''
horrible .
this place was horrible .
so he instead gave us a medium sized pan and refunded us the difference .
rating : garbage !
dining room and restrooms were both clean .
what a disappointment .
it tasted like nothing and did n't move .
horrible pizza / horrible service .
employees make you feel like your putting them out for ordering overpriced pizza .
i do n't get it .
why settle ?
worst place ever .
i have been dealing with that for _num_ yrs and am ok with it .
there is nothing ny about this pizza any more .
i can not agree with that in any way , shape or form .
this is sad .
we ordered a medium white pizza and a plain calzone .
the dough was not fresh and tasted old .
very disappointing .
hey , can anyone recommend a fabulous ny pizza place in north scottsdale ?
driving around looking for pizza , came across this place .
i must say the people working the register , i 'm thinking the owner ?
was very very grumpy .
pay and walk away .
hey you never know until you try it right ?
limited choice of toppings .
however , the pepperoni is on the spicy side .
if you 're open , maybe you should make some freaking pizza !
wish i did n't !
each half of the pizza contained the exact ingredients i wanted for lunch .
disappointing .
not really a lunch special .
this pizza is not really good .
not true .
i would not recommend this place .
the sales rep could 've at least offered to check .
extremely bad customer service !
in april , i ordered , and completely paid for two chairs .
i 've had $ _num_ pedis and $ _num_ pedis .
the price i paid for my pedi was almost double what was advertised .
if you go cheap you get cheap service .
horrible service !
rude service !
Neutral
money and time wasted .
i thought prices for alterations were expensive there but its way more here .
it was annoying .
over priced and rude .
theres much better in scottsdale for the price .
the front office staff is completely inept .
up to _num_ clients at a time using every piece of equipment .
not to mention , there is never open parking !
what a rip off .
_num_ for valet trash ?
the staff is terrible .
parking : rarely will you find a parking spot .
maintenance : our water is constantly being shut off .
`` immediately '' was the answer i was given over an hour ago .
have i quite finished ?
expect the website where you pay your rent to go down every month .
they never fixed that problem .
no flavor .
i kept my expectations low .
this is okay pizza , but it is not nyc pizza .
no more .
garlic bread is now a side dish which is extra .
i feel like the pizza at streets of new york is pretty plain jane .
nothing special .
not going back .
very disappointed !
terrible pizza .
$ _num_ for shit pizza .
you could actually crunch through chunks of salt on top of it .
it 's $ _num_ and was a bunch of lettuce !
what an awful place .
i am a vegetarian and they kept making a pizza with pepperoni .
very disappointing service .
finally , a batch of cold garlic bread sticks arrived with steaming marinara .
Very positive
nothing special .
i ate half the sandwich , and took the other half home .
later that evening my fianc became ill and the next morning i become ill .
it looked like boiled meat .
also , hotdog garlic bread ?
not perfect but beats domino 's and some other ny style places .
`` the first _num_ letters in a common name . ''
the pizza tasted just like the pizza at little caesars !
terrible fucking service .
waiter is wasted as hell .
unknown to me until recently my parents quit ordering from this location also .
they were at least _num_ time a month customers .
poor location of pumps .
avoid .
but the male manager of this salon needs a serious attitude adjustment .
so i turned around and drove back to the salon .
i could n't believe this .
maybe if you are a frequent customer to this salon you are treated differently .
so , if you are new to this salon beware .
it was awful .
awkward .
this place was awful !
cheap polish and products !
up until friday , this salon was my favorite .
recently , i had a problem with the amount i was being charged .
truly awful .
it is not a fun place for little ones any more .
place is very clean , hence the _num_ stars .
no value for money .
slowest delivery ever !
my issue was your pricing .
i drove by and decided , hey i will try them .
!
in fact , i 'm livid .
i decided to drop of my absolute favorite boots to rave .
i sent _num_ bags to rave in august _num_ .
Negative
not impressed .
he was paid in full over _num_ thousand dollars .
he just did not care .
during this procedure he broke the tip of a file in my tooth .
i walked around and just felt odd and out of place .
it 's peter the greeter .
ok no problem .
not good .
horrible experience !
my husband and i recently found out i was pregnant with our first child .
she never returned my call .
this place is horrible .
terrible bedside manner !
ok , end rant .
the nurse practitioner i saw ( dr .
no thanks .
so this can drag on ?
so cold .
well woman visits book 3-4 months out .
sounds like big o tires needs my business next time.
never again will i go there .
terrible neighbor .
this was her desperate attempt at trying to get rid of me .
you 'll regret living here .
management does n't get back to you .
do n't trust this place !
they also lock the restroom doors in the pool area .
i would n't move here again .
also the watering of the grass is out of control .
ridiculous !
this place sucks .
they are just hurting for money .
my waiter was obviously overworked .
it was so crowded .
wrong .
turns out the quiche has _num_ calories in it .
my daughter ordered some sort of salad with walnuts and strawberries in it .
the calorie count was under _num_ .
tried a new place for breakfast , mimi 's in scottsdale .
not somewhere i would choose to go to again .
however , on our most recent visit we had ordered the chicken fettuccine dish .
however , that was the least of my worries .
but the food is the big problem here .
note : i have also eaten at mimi 's for breakfast several times .
although better than dinner , mimi 's breakfasts are pretty ordinary .
slow , indifferent service .
a nice restaurant , but i only go here with the parents .
no chance , huh ?
who puts deep fried cheese balls on a salad ?
the hostess were rude .
i ordered chicken piccata ( which comes with mashed potatoes and vegetables ) .
the vegetables were a joke .
totally gross !
it 's just generally not as good as i remember .
they do n't get it .
not a good idea .
this is not a french restaurant !
where is the santa fe omelette ?
even as late as 7pm !
just not a great experience .
apparently service is not a priority .
wo n't be back .
someone also ordered eggs , fruit and croissant which was fine .
no greeting at all .
the waiter never introduced himself .
he did n't smile and was not friendly .
_num_ .

overall , the experience was embarrassing , expensive , and a huge regret .
the dressing is also low in calories which is an added bonus !
this place was a ghost town and past its prime .
boring food lame atmosphere .
it was gross .
small potatoes are awful .
small salad for $ _num_ extra .
i tried , i really tried .
he told me all about their other offering , wings , sandwiches , deserts .
only this time the crust was even more chewy and soft then before .
very disappointed .
they need to use better cheese , and tastier sauce .
wrong .
not worth it .
arrogant & incompetent !
_num_ customers waiting in line to pay .
pathetic .
horrible staff .
waiting room is a cattle call .
they scheduled is appointment at 7:30 am .
no one was there .
the glendale office is never open on thursday .

i had a gift card for a detail so i had to go here .
i am paying money to have a car detailed !
will not go back !
sorry , cobblestone .
i will keep this plain and simple .
only then did i receive the money owed to me .
they are nuts - so i need to really put energy out there now .
it just was n't good .
after discussing things with the manager , he refunded half of our $ .
my rating for this store is a _num_ stars !
terrible customer service .
i do n't find the staff friendly or respectful .
_num_ .
just a minimal effort could have solved these issues .
absolute worst .
what they could have wiped down was dusty and never touched .
takes forever and is an absolute zoo .
disgusted .
take everything out of your car if you get your car washed here .
managers wonder why they ca n't keep employees longer than one week .
took my car to the bell and _num_ local .
they are acting like this on purpose .
biggest jerks in az .
obviously just go any place else and you 'll have a better experience .
first and last time we will visit this car wash .
there was more dust let from the towels they used .
upon replacing the defective glass , my rear view mirror fell off days later .
charles the service tech is the only one willing to help .
wo n't be back .
i am extremely disappointed !
i will not go back .
the car wash is ill managed or not managed .
the car wash is ill managed or not managed .
another horrible wash .
wrong decision .
i frequently get my vehicles washed and/or detailed .
unbelievable .
when this is all over this will be a _num_ day process .
totally disgusted .
worst .
?
worst car wash ever !
my dogs also left two very distinct mud marks on the back seat .
boy was i wrong .
this place is horrible !
i upgraded my car wash so the inside of the car would get cleaned .
when i drove off i noticed that they had only done a basic wash .
first off all , he didnt come over to help me .
but , this place sets the bar at an all-time low .
sadly it was not .
all i want is my car washed !
no thanks !
horrible service !
not worth the $ _num_ .
_num_ strikes .
every time i go for a wash and get up sold .
the upsell is too much .
do n't continue to try and sell me something else .
she contacted her insurance and had all the paperwork done and sent to cobblestone .
i will also be looking into contacting scottsdale police to file a theft report .
i will not return here .
dash still had the same dust as before it went in .
what a frustrating experience !
i understand this is scottsdale but damn have a little customer service !
no stars .
i had a very stressful experience .
i am pissed !
he is nasty and rude .
very poor customer service .
it remained neglected all weekend .
and thats where the greatness ends .
the staff is horrible !
freaking idiots .
it was like pulling teeth to communicate with maintenance or anyone in the office .
however , once you are in , there are a lot of problems .
nice property , but the front office needs some serious customer service training .
there was precious little interaction or communication with me .
we will not be going back .
this has been going on for years with these _num_ receptionists .
i went for another treatment the beginning of _num_ .
after my treatment i was in pain .
_num_ .
hotel looks a bit dated .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
water pressure was good for the 3rd floor .
but for business ?
the glasses case `` fell behind our storage bin . ''
there was limited hot water in my room .
i would n't stay again .
hard to find .
next i attended classes by julie and ken .
i would highly recommended them as instructors .
Negative
a family member recently was sent to this facility after a joint replacement .
rachel h. things sure have changed since your _num_ star review .
sad stuff but reality .
i went to the deli to get a sandwhich .
they were awful !
_num_ lbs . ''
are you kidding me ?
disappointing .
not with my other groceries .
_num_ .
_num_ .
total bummer because i used to love the sandwich bar .
worst .
brought them to a shelter where they would get more value .
i was in shock and took it .
the girls are way less than friendly and super snobby .
it needs better regular maintenance and some updating might help i.e .
first , the staff is very helpful and courteous .
i have not stayed here yet , but will be in early september .
so am i looking forward to spending my weekend at this place ?
not really .
no elevators .
i probably would n't stay here again .
bottom line : not really a `` resort '' & beware of wifi pricing !
a colleague and i stayed in a _num_ bedroom unit .
totally insulting .
i 'll think twice before booking links again .
it does not have a restaurant .
towels were a bit rough .
staff was friendly and maintenance took care of a couple of problems we had .
they have not refunded my deposit and it 's now been two months !
what the hell ?
they only fixed the lights , not the tv remote .
wifi is n't free .
this is n't a resort .
thinks again and picking this as a resort you want to stay in .
no elevators !
not staying there ever again .
i thought i had everything cleared up and just recently they started again .
i was in so much pain , i spent two days in bed .
just awful !
horrible experience .
i have short hair and it took her _num_ hours to wrap my hair .
level _num_ is $ _num_ bucks ? )
it 's just wrong .
!
i just went last week to get highlights .
i was very disappointed .
i bought a refrigerator from their phoenix outlet center .
i truly regret of being here today .
when i was a kid the western bacon was one of my favorite burgers .
ingredients are still the same , it just tastes different .
i just hate these sandwiches now .
she 's putting an inch stack of white lettuce on it .
pretty much sounded like he doesnt care for any business ... .
i would not go here again .
what i like about los olivos is their nachos .
i am not even kidding .
heard about los olivos from a friend who had been to the original one .
my friend and i shared the pollo fundido , which was pretty standard .
slow service .
each time i get the same experience .
crappy service .
give them a star for meeting my super low expectations !
never going back .
our waiter never smiled ... seemed grumpy that he was working .
just very drab and plain like the wait staff !
it was my favorite .
horrible food and horrible service .
this restaurant is a far cry from the los olivos i know .
horrible !
got to find another mexican restaurant that knows how to cook .
chips & salsa were fine .
ugh this place is nasty !
for a _num_ dollar tab id expect better service !
as for mexican food it runs about a three star restaurant .
probably wont be going back .
they refused .
i refused to pay .
have n't had any in the house in some time .
no follow-up .
that night , when we returned home , _num_ pm .
no apologize ; no pretend to listen .
so , we scheduled again , this time for 7am .
i have been a customer for over _num_ years for regular , monthly service .
i am new to az and wanted business cards printed .
extremely disgusting .
will not shop there again .
too many other adequate options .
the young lady behind the counter said you 'll have to wait for it .
thinking it will be like 15-20 min .
beware of misleading prices .
i hate this copy center .
i 've been in gas station bathrooms that are cleaner than this .
i am disgusted .
i just bought _num_ tires at christmas .
he comes back and says they are not looking very good .
are you kidding me ?
next time i am going to big o tires or sears .
horrible service .
less than impressed with the service i just received .
i might go back for service work but not for an oil change .
i also had to bring the car back after service to resolve workmanship problems .
i am talking like _num_ years .
lots of them died .
it 's been more than _num_ hours !
very disappointed .
_num_ instructors , both .
edit : since writing this review i have switched clubs .
b . )
seems a little small and cramped .
location is ok , prices cheap .
i joined _num_ months ago , before i started working .
this is crap .
edit : they 're closed ?
this is not a dump .
that 's _num_ months for only like $ _num_ .
i get them fed , dressed & out the door with time to spare .
if you are reading this in search of a pediatrician .
holy crap !
then i chose debit and entered my pin .
later , my pants split .
my shirt had a hole in it .
a button popped off .
first the food is more expensive than chipotle but not higher quality .
for those with a healthy appetite , the quantity is also smaller .
the only point that scored higher than chipotle was the salsa selection .
baja has a separate salsa bar where customers can serve themselves .
outdated .
bad food .
the employees never offer suggestions , which may be an english language barrier .
before we even made it into the restaurant , we were immediately on edge .
the years have not been kind to this building .
this place actually gets _num_ stars .
i walked out .
instead of crown he filled my tooth .
do not trust your dentist .
fridge is n't full yet .
asked for ranch with my chicken fingers .
apparently once is n't enough .
i never ate from jack in the box after this .
i went for food for _num_ people .
i 'm once again without food .
do not go to this location .
here 's the story .
tried a green smoothie , the apple and greens .
i couldnt taste pineapple or ginger like i normally do .
not just once .
the next day i was going to stay again .
then _num_ time they came to my door and made me leave .
they gave me the key to a room where a man was sleeping .
it was a nightmare .
no stove .
ugh .
this review is long overdue .
big mistake !
excuse me ?
anyways my point is i 'm a guest too !
it does n't cover anything but they are sure to take your deposit .
i do n't recommend this apartment .
we went to the office and found out she had taken the day off .
they were just _num_ trips late -- do n't ya think .
that is disgusting .
they claimed the area in dining room had permanent dirt .
bonus pool ?
i decide to leave the bike there .
)
_num_ star .
_num_ stars .
end result : fail .
he does n't listen to your requests .
i walked in looking to buy a new road bike .
wrong .
i had just upgraded to a new chain _num_ month ago .
no explanation .
since then , i 've found _num_ offices that will do it .
she commented that i could have had the surgery done while she was boarded .
very poor service .
used to love boston chicken but it 's declined too much .
the manager tracy clearly hates both her life and her job .
when i arrive there , i tell them i 'm picking up my order .
_num_ people were there , counting me .
horrible decision .
horrible service .
i did n't care anymore .
too frustrated .
nasty , nasty , nasty !
advice ... find another doctor .
total scam .
shocking , as they had worked on this car for years .
disappointing !
i 've been to scottsdale nails twice , today was my second time .
do n't let this happen to you .
the others i 've had have been very rough .
not a fan .
bad practice .
when giving scottsdale nails stars , i had to really think it about .
that is the only nice thing i can say .
after much thought , i chose another salon all together .
not from az but decided on a business trip to get my nails done .
i recently got into the gel manicure trend .
i went there last friday before a hair appointment next door .
today , i brought my son to my routine gel manicure visit .
this comment completely blew me away .
she was then handed off to another tech to do her pedicure .
shoes are ruined .
i wish i had treated her to any other nail salon but this one !
service here is hit or miss .
i just get the feeling that all is not above board .
i '' m surprised the reviewer before me got in so fast .
home of the ten dollar burrito ?
this is not good service.
it is slow & inefficient .
not cool .
sure hope chipotle reads these reviews .
watching people leave after standing in line so long .
skimpy skimpy skimpy .
disappointed .
awful customer service .
just came from this location .
so sad .
hundred degrees out waited in car with air on till _num_ o'clock .
_num_ .
and it also seems like there are never enough workers .
_num_ .
um , hell no .
_num_ .
that 's just gross .
i am never going back .
yes , , , i counted every person in line .
truly dreadful location .
so i hopped in my little car and off i went to phx .
she was great in ordering , but as for refilling drinks ?
not so much .
for starters , the burgers .
my hamburger last night was clearly two frozen patties grilled with toppings .
until tonight , all of our experiences at red robin had been positive .
even at this location , our past meals had been enjoyable .
i 'm going to red robin many dozens of times over the years .
horrible service !
to bring out a simple cheeseburger out and a salad .
too bad .
but , those days are done .
the service is inconsistent .
i really do not like this .
come on , just let a server come by and take my order .
too bad .
nothing worked for me .
Positive
however , i feel strongly about this .
i had it reviewed by medical professionals & glad i trusted myself & md .
i stopped coming to this starbucks .
he is horrible .
she did , and it processed correctly .
still just as horrible .
i 've never seen such lines as i have at this drive thru .
ridiculous .
on two occasions i went to jiffy lube for an oil change .
not surprising , he did it anyway .
they could not .
that was the problem .
not a jiffy lube place .
the box for cleaning the windows was checked .
just plain nuts !
case in point , air pressure on the tires .
but , i 'm sure they lose customers because of the wait for service .
i never get treated at starbucks like that or anywhere .
baristas are not genuinely kind here.
management messed up our bill two months in a row .
horrible customer service .
greasy palms much ?
nobody wants to wait in long lines .
the first available appointment was december 3rd .
unacceptable !
i am disappointed .
the factory store has crazy insane prices on bread .
it sucks .
i have been attending scottsdale bible church for over a year .
i never went inside the store after driving there .
i mean pieces of hair were just coming off in my fingers .
obviously , the store was really meant for drive through customers .
the prices looked comparable to fry 's , but not nearly the selection .
worst doctor and staff !
worst doctor ever .
i scheduled my appointment for _num_ .
do not recommend and will never go back .
the staff is terrible .
my husband and i were customers with tiffany 's cleaners in december of _num_ .
very disappointing !
definitely bad business .
i 'm pretty disappointed .
if all i had was that , i would still be hungry .
a complimentary dessert was brought out towards the end for the guest of honor .
ugh .
thinly sliced beef with assorted veggies ( some greens , noodles , mushrooms ) .
this place is ok i guess .
the restaurant is located in the back of a dumpy mall .
the waitresses run around like chickens with their heads cut off by day .
it 's a bit old fashioned and not a big variety of rolls .
awkward .
service : clueless .
so confusing .
just was n't really impressed with anything .
and it was cooked salmon .
i ordered miso soup and my friends ordered the octopus salad to start .
finally had to walk up to the sushi bar and grab _num_ plates .
our waitress was rude .
the rolls were a little loose and hard to eat .
`` , i admit to trying this place three times .
attended first visit two years ago as an invited guest of others .
second visit could be better described as an attempt .
was shown to our table immediately upon arrival by the hostess .
so a client of mine picked this for dinner .
steady fish , hit or miss .
traditional favorites , but where is the passion ?
methinks one might get better fish cuts with more regular patronage .
i echo the service problems of other reviewers !
would not come again or recommend .
we just returned last eve .
their listed hours mean nothing !
if you do go here , pick sunday as that is their deal day .
i will not return again .
the food was so-so ... nothing memorable .
profit over client care ?
lots of wasted time .
rescheduled _num_ weeks further out .
never had this before .
nope , sorry .
failure .
my uncle was sent here after an extended stay at mayo hospital .
nursing quality very poor .
in short very few are skilled at this facility and all are over worked .
i used the chipotle app on my iphone to order two burritos .
hey chipotle , where is the meat ?
do not use this place !
i went here on a friday around noon to send certified tax documents .
you 're killing me !
but yesterday , mike , the owner , crossed the line .
i never sweat the small stuff .
but yesterday , mike , the owner , crossed the line .
the guy is rude !
i know what i 'm doing , i 've applied for a passport before .
i 'm probably going to have to get more taken .
do not go to this place !
would not recommend at all !
no teacher near her .
no comfort .
i have had experience getting chemical peel about _num_ times before using this service .
how rude is that ?
i will not be returning .
i was in twice this week .
sara , your customer service skills suck .
worst service ever !
maybe i do n't look like a motorcycle mama .
stopped at scottsdale harley to get my oil changed .
terrible customer service .
the service department sucks .
they were wrong .
so jeff hook me up on a test ride .
but for the most part not to happy with them .
ugh .
dang i sure miss the old store more employees bigger place .
this was `` before '' the build .
after the `` build '' i stopped in an walked around .
that felt more like a local store then scottsdale hd .
i ended up buying my 4th hd from them ( used ) .
gross !
Neutral
dishonest shop !
are you kidding me ?
just my luck .
i went into crown to sell some gold and jewelry that i had .
i 'm sure a jeweler misses it once in awhile .
they are just bad .
they cant even find time to send a quote despite calling several times .
too expensive .
rude staff .
the salad was better than the pizza and the wings were pretty good .
our chicken parmesan arrived obviously microwaved .
not even close .
was stoked to try this pizza because it seems to have several good reviews .
stick with sandwiches and pizza .
uninspired and blend pizza !
my wife and i split a small caesar salad ( $ _num_ ) .
we also split a _num_ '' pesto chicken pizza ( $ _num_ ) .
service was bad .
poor service !
unacceptable .
are you kidding me ?
this place feels like a tgi fridays .
there are better options .
( still have a couple other options - cottage cheese , for example . )
no thanks .
my husband had the fish tacos which were good .
we went there tonight after costco .
the waitress `` forgot '' to take the kid 's meals off .
a groupon would normally state that .
oh , and it was the same temperature inside as it was outside .
my _num_ year old was sweating for the first time .
horrible service .
horrible service .
there is nothing really stand out about this place .
worst experience ever .
dude never takes their order or even offers them drinks .
when we got there , the _num_ people already there had drinks .
terrible drinks and mediocre food .
was not impressed at all !
horrible service .
felt rushed .
the second time it happened , the temperature was still _num_ degrees .
poor customer service .
it 's _num_ degrees people !
very rude .
said would have tech call back .
2:30 i get a call from another person .
it was my girlfriends birthday last week .
tim even offered to drop the flowers off on his way home .
by day _num_ the arrangement looked a week old .
i would not recommend them .
gross .
this tastes nothing like mexican food .
tastes like they heated up some jose ole in the micro .
never going back .
decent food , average service , cheesy decor but killer margaritas .
food is n't the best .
i always feel like i ate a rock when i leave .
this fell short in many ways .
for example , the fresh tomato salsa served with my fajitas was spent .
a huge disappointment ?
they werent as hot as i hoped they would be .
i could get better quality at food city .
not worth it .
a huge disappointment .
dont wan na go back .
!
not the end of the world .
low budget food at high budget prices .
soda 's were flat .
too expensive for the quality .
ate more and much tastier foods at local mexican joints for significantly less .
not very clean and not very cool .
we ate here for the first time as we purchased a groupon .
we ate here for lunch .
they serve chips , salsa , and refried beans as a starter .
skip it .
i used to eat at this restaurant all the time .
i was so annoyed .
bad hosts , bad server .
it sucks .
the service runs so hot and cold it can be embarrassing .
two days later i took a party of _num_ there from work .
it was 1pm when we walked in .
restaurant _num_ % full .
what a shame .
camelback store does not have this problem .
wrong !

it came with cold chicken tasting as though it had been boiled .
one burrito and a grilled chicken salad .
service was lousy .
went here thinking we could get cheap yummy mexican .
same prices as the other mexican restaurants i like much better .
i honestly think calling her a bitch would be giving her credit .
my husband also ordered pork taquitos which he was underwhelmed by .
$ _num_ total .
$ _num_ does not make sense .
i really wish hygiene were more of a priority .
that booth , however , had sticky seats and table .
house margs are good cheap and big .
horrible service .
horrible management .
bad experience overall .
not talking seems to be a trend at this establishment .
wrong !
gross .
they should be embarrassed .
horrible service !
the chips and dip was the only bonus out of the entire meal .
this place just sucks .
could n't remember why .
based on my experience ; however , we strongly recommend valle luna .
what happened to this place .
service was spotty and the food was so-so .
poor greasy food .
dirty and bad service .
do n't use the bathroom .
my wife got the chicken chili relleno .
it came drenched in cheese that was actually soupy at the bottom .
surprisingly bad .
went tonight for first time .
should not even give it one star .
never ever going back .
service was slow .
that should be standard on a _num_ plate of food .
worst customer service .
i 've visited this location numerous times as it 's located near my office .
horrible mistake .
horrible service .
never get a call , but at 8am the installers arrive .
also , the office would want to see me at that time .
so i went to yelp to read reviews for this and other locations .
it appears this company has problems from top to bottom .
to write a certain number of characters .
there yelp , is that enough info for ya !
management is almost nonexistent .
i quit after _num_ holes .
waited _num_ min .
too hot in the summer to be running behind all day .
did n't care .
i 'm never going back .
the driver confirmed that we were going to devil 's martini , old town .

when we arrive , he hands me an invoice for $ _num_ .
i 'm thinking , car services have only one job , right ?
never got an answer as to what really went on .
no surprise .
i ran over and stopped the driver explaining that we have an account .
_num_ .
_num_ .
worst customer service ever .
terrible experience .
i am so disgusted .
the music was loud , especially for the wee hours of the morning .
so ok , i guess .
i should have insisted upon a receipt .
so the driver got the tip in cash and on the credit card !
so customers beware of the drivers using your credit card .
but as i said , they were very prompt in picking us up .
horrible .
the driver dropped us off at the restaurant without an issue .
i made a prepaid reservation for pick-up at sky harbor .
i went into this store in may to transfer my service from verizon .
the options described on the website are extremely deceiving .
this was suppose to be a _num_ hour `` experience '' .
totally not worth it .
was i free to sit anywhere i want ?
of course , no !
where is the _num_ calorie meals ?
Negative
i recently went there for lunch .
wrong .
no beans .
no rice .
no pico de gallo .
what the hell ?
we also ordered the california grilled chicken flatbread appetizer .
the server then went to our server and talked about it with attitude .
the food was horrible .
it did not taste fresh and everything was cold .
they need to train their line cooks how to cook food .
the ribs were delicious but everything else was a _num_ star experience .
he said , can i get you another salad ?
it 's very unfortunate .
as plain as day !
very poor customer service !
i , on the other hand , was invisible apparently .
you started off so well ... .
i get my sandwich and on it are three red tomatoes slices .
i know i sound like a brat .
i used the drive-thru , which took quite some time .
complete disappointment .
disappointing waste of time !
it is not always worth it .
no refund and no refrigerator !
there 's some great furniture and the name says it all fiesta .
i 'm not a fan .
i ordered asada burrito with beef .
i 'm not crazy about the blue burrito grill .
i think chipotle , qdoba , and fiesta burrito are a lot better .
this was not that place .
_num_ .
the food was cold .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i would rate them _num_ 1/2 stars .
more than chipotle and not as fresh i think .
this is my second visit , and maybe last ?
i got the nachos both time but i take most stuff off .
we never make appointments ( just walk in ) .
it seems as though the adjustment for mistakes cuts only one way .
these guys suck bad !
their customer service and pricing is far from even being satisfactory .
needless to say , my car is being repaired by van 's .
never have i given a review this low .
worst service ever .
do n't be fooled by this `` gourmet '' shit either .
skip this joint ... .
the service was terrible .
fifteen dollars , ladies and gentlemen .
ugh .
went there for the gluten free menu items for my child .
she stated no problem .
ordered for my two children the gluten free pizza .
manager does not come over .
he was very cold & asked the service rep what model car i had .
shame on you !
not the cheapest car to own or drive !
no body , no favor .
come on folks , find someone who knows wine to pick a good selection .
i was looking forward to going to _num_ peaks after hearing great things .
i was looking forward to going to _num_ peaks after hearing great things .
but , hey , free lunch .
turkey club ? ''
excuse me ?
bottom line : drive the extra _num_ miles ( seriously !
weak .
and wear normal t-shirt sizes .
okay , yes ... the place is loud .
no such luck .
and instead of a rum and coke , we got a diet rum .
try this , and see if it 's better . ''
i was so excited to go here with my husband .
having read good reviews , we were ready to have a good night out .
)
, but i really must stop ordering the pasta dinner specials to go .
ick .
frozen , then refried .
ugh .
# burgers are a miss in every way .
ugh .
horrible service .
waited another _num_ for a server .
i understand the point of trying to reach out to a larger crowd .
in this case , stick to the original .
if you do n't mind noise , the food might be good .
it was more like overpriced fish sticks .
very disappointing .
fat fat and more fat .
in short , our server forgot about us .
i will patronize other local beers , breweries , and restaurants .
not a place for football sunday !
why is everything diet here ?
i do n't get it .
eggs had no taste .
the second was on saturday they state their hours are until 3pm .
make sure you get everything in writing .
it always seems like they are understaffed at the registers .
not attentive at all .
i looked around the windows and doors dept .
long story short .
not helpful .
one star is one star too many .
rip off !
not very healthy either .
_num_ ) kids meal should could with fruit and/or vegetable .
a grilled cheese sandwich and a cookie is not a balanced meal .
nope .
consistently inconsistent .
wildflower has weird tasting food - sauces , bread , cheese , sides .
no normal food here .
first and last time here .
not worth the money .
this is ridiculous .
went to check out showroom and was never greeted by anyone .
the selection was boring !
but it looks like i 'll have to keep on passing on by .
started off with some chips and salsa ... pretty standard .
i also tried the shrimp burro ... aka a big shrimp burrito .
the last thing i tried was the beef enchiladas .
skip the frozen margaritas !
after reading reviews and looking at pictures , i had to try it .
star _num_ - how was the service and atmosphere ?
star _num_ - how were the portions relative to the cost ?
even for gourmet mexican , that 's too much .
no star granted .
especially paying $ _num_ ?
star _num_ - would you eat it every day if you could ?
no star granted .
i just wish the rest of the meal had lived up to the chips .
after reading reviews on yelp we decided to try this place .
we went there for lunch yesterday .
my chimichanga was doughy , and tamale was like cake - very airy masa .
your sign says breakfast until _num_ .
meh , very mediocre .
not real flavorful .
will not recommend !
before we met with him , we talked to his associate .
the meeting lasted _num_ hours .
the meeting ended , he gave asked if he could hug me ... .
this company does not even deserve _num_ star .
just _num_ day of treatment & i 'm feeling & looking better already .
no thanks !
not a fan .
gel pedi , french mani and eyebrows .
all three were not good quality .
i guess she must be doing very well to turn away business .
luckily , he signed off on the extra expense .
has lost its way .
they quoted me a dentist and _num_ specialists and $ _num_ .
glad i switched to another place .
expensive and somewhat disappointing .

let 's just say i like the old one better .
so not comfortable .
i like that they have light lemonade though .
_num_ called , they want their theatre back .
small screens , big time price .
where is the stadium seating ?
small screens because the theaters are small .
our normal theater is a regal in gilbert .
nothing could be further from the truth .
regal and amc have my business .
very noisy people .
also , if you have a cough stay home !
also another issue and this for all theaters .
finally i convinced him to call another technician to come and service the pump .
turns out the pump was completely destroyed .
i 'm so glad i am done with this company .
had multiple problems with installation as well .
how wrong i was .
so $ _num_ .
so do n't complain about locals not supporting small businesses .
really tee 'd off the wife .
$ _num_ bucks for this ?
not the friendliest folks in there .
i went to this place a total of _num_ times .
management was notified and they made her a new order and comped the meal .
no call back .
what a disappointment !
it is awful .
call before , you go pick up to make sure your order is ready .
just keeps getting worse .
and in fact , the gluten free options i tried were pretty good .
gluten free asian fusion is not difficult .
probably will not be returning any time soon .
i did like the sand in the bunkers .
the greens were horrible .
set up a _num_ man tournament here .
on my way in i passed the same groups on _num_ .
the service was terrible .
not this camper .
if you dont own , dont go there .
other staff seem to be quite friendly .
but i was quickly over that .
just plain awkward and uncomfortable .
when you are here you really just want to finish up and leave .
i have had cilantro lime roasted corn before and that was spectacular .
nothing special .
not a four seasons more like a double tree .
i was there from feb _num_ through _num_ .
the room they put me in had construction noise outside all day long !
room _num_ .
wrong .
horrible .
our waiter even commented how they looked different than usual .
ugh .
very sad .
a few days later we gave proof another chance for breakfast .
my steak was so-so .
poor customer service .
not a comfortable atmosphere from the baristas .
everyone much more friendly at carefree highway store !
seriously rude & condescending staff .
service was terrible .
in addition to the cold water ( which she warmed up upon request ) .
the manicure was not .
i would not recommend this salon .
not sanitary !
the other tools went back into her case without being cleaned .
they are rude !
the food was not good .
my boyfriend ordered the largest steak dinner $ _num_ .
his steak was the _num_ lb porterhouse .
he then walked away .
_num_ for the live music too .
overall : i was underwhelmed by my visit .
this place is ok except all the old ties everywhere .
absurd .
$ _num_ a piece for an onion ring ?
but it must have been a small chicken .
a waste .
the answer here ... not for a long long time .
the step down out the front door needs to be addressed .
the floor drops down about _num_ inches right outside the door .
is there gold in the beef ?
the burgers only come w/ beans .
potato , salad , and corn are all extra .
the service was terrible .
perhaps the equivalent of applebee 's at prices that were about double that .
this place is terrible !
so disappointed .
no stars !
not good .
loud , but that 's what we expected .
horrible service every time .
really bad !
if it did , business would drop like a rock .
very poor service .
i suggest not ordering anything there and making a sandwich at home .
_num_ .
very small space , forget finding a table at lunch time .
_num_ .
seriously , i think my `` sandwich artist '' was counting black olives .
_num_ .
sometimes i need to repeat myself because they are n't paying attention .
sometimes it 's really hard for restaurants to find good employees .
just ugh .
the noodles were spaghetti noodles , not chinese noodles .
the hot and sour soup was orange .
to say that to a chinese couple is like a slap in the face .
we had the chicken with string beans and the salt and pepper shrimp .
we could n't understand it .
small on portions , big on price !
i visited here with my dad for lunch .
and , again , cold beer .
this place is awful .
dinner was not even close to good.
sesame chicken and thai chicken curry .
no apologies .
we will not be back .
my husband and i stopped for take-out .
lame , lame , lame .
golf was good , service was laughable .
what a disappointment .
the greens were a little sandy and definitely slower than we all expected .
and it absolutely does not .
brutal .
for most of the round , we have _num_ groups on every hole .
service is slow .
employees are rude .
the deli area is frequently out of high demand food items .
i will drive over twice the distance to shop at another grocery .
simply put , this fry 's has not earned our business .
like that they have a red box , but who does n't these days ?
wo n't be back .
i put the car in reverse , went to the window and waited .
the cheese is cold though '' .
i was afraid to open the bag but i was brave .
i could n't even eat it .
this burger king is very dumpy , and looks like it needs an upgrade .
gross !
always regret eating at bk .
in _num_ years , we have never gotten the correct order .
i would not recommend this contractor .
not professional .
went in for a few highlights on shoulder length hair .
she messed up the highlights and they were very chunky up front .
stylist theresa gets a _num_ star review .
horrible !
terrible customer service !
took my _num_ yr old daughter for a simple wash , cut and style .
are you kidding me ?
this is so lame !
you 've been warned .
greens were slow and uneven .
like that 's my problem .
skip it .
yuck , just yuck .
the eggplant was greasy and dry .
very disappointing .
bad pizza .
bad customer service .
too inconsistent for me .
maybe it 's cause the crust is too heavy .
not proper housekeeping !
_num_ weeks prior to our trip he made the reservations and we received confirmation .
quite disappointed !
obviously , the designer of the room felt completely different .
i could go on , but you get the drift .
counted the cars that evening and _num_ cars existed .
the rooms are extremely loud !
the amenities are none existent .
the pool is a bit larger than a six person hot tub .
unbelievable ... we got bumped and sent down the road to a courtyard marriott .
the large floor tiles were loose and a hazard .
it was obvious they could care less .
musty smell in the room .
probably would not stay here again .
i arrived and it was quite busy , still looking good .
_num_ .
_num_ .
there was a lady bug in my greek salad .
except it takes longer than one minute to cook eggs and toast bagels .

nothing .
service was horrible .
walked in and smelled even though they were in the middle of cleaning up .
not even a sorry .
the food was not good .
this place is not good .
the owners clearly cater to the white clientele of the area .
chow mein was fine except maybe a tad too sweet .
bad food , bad service .
this place was nearby so i decided to check it out .
every so often they have these sale days when everything is _num_ % off .
it 's not really worth making the trip from phoenix .
terrible service .
the service was terrible .
it was an alcoholic beverage .
poor service .
we walked out and we will never return !
extremely poor management !
food was horrible .
service was very slow .
can not recommend .
would not go here again .
staff is overwhelmed when the place gets busy .
it still had the pepperoni grease dripping off it .
what a ripoff .
wheels were not touched .
terrible place .
bad , bad experience !
not the $ _num_ package , the $ _num_ package .
this place had _num_ people - across _num_ lanes - all sharing cars .
i mean , what the freak ?
not a detail job that can be paid now and done years from now .
wow !
i really believe that is why they get away with it .
i had a coupon for two free toppings on any pizza delivery .
what i got was one pizza with _num_ toppings .
so far , not impressed .
walked in , place has _num_ table full of about _num_ people .
terrible pizza .

the cheese is kinda greasy and soft , probably cheaper .
from a reliable source , this restaurant is for sale .
shame on you .
shame on you !
i 'm from chicago visiting family and needed a pedi .
i have had my nails done before and they never looked that .
i did n't ask for my money back .
disappointing .
think i 'm exaggerating ?
gross food horrible parking .
that 's nasty !
seems like they could do a lot better with customer service and food prep .
the cashier was very short with me and not personable at all .
terrible .
over priced , unnecessary procedures , never on time .
disappointed and frustrated .
this is n't it .
i figured i either had an air leak or my pump was clogged .
if not ?
fairly straightforward , except for the fact that mr .
not going back .
the grooming was average at best .
we can not recommend this company anymore .
i can never get excited about eating here .
you can count on ... ... ... your entire order arriving at once ... .
he was extremely rude .
suggest getting other quotes fountain hills .
worst customer service imaginable !
do not use this firm !
next time i will go directly to the grocery store to buy my flowers .
very very long wait .
so i did that , but i still have extreme pain .
we are extremely displeased with this dentist office !
they continued discussing how the fountain hills branch was expected to increase their profit .
i 'm like , why not ?
what goes around comes around girls .
i even left over _num_ % , that 's my karma .
knew i 'd write this review immediately , and probably call the manager .
bad food , horrible service .

i would n't come back again .
i will not be returning again .

the food was not very good .
we will not be going back .
i would not suggest this place .
borderline rude .
no thanks .
wo n't come back .

first off , their management needs a lesson in customer service !
this fountain hills location needs some tlc , better cleaning requirements , etc .
ca n't someone take care of these ?
just decided that we spent our last dollar there last week .
prices not good .
it 's fountain hills so it 's expected i guess .
Neutral
it 's just so difficult to hit _num_ wood or rescue off the tee .
never seen grass so long on tees before .
reason for the _num_ stars .
i happened to get a craving for apple pie .
poor food and poor service .
this time , not so much .
avoid this place !
i 've almost never had a good waitress at denny 's before .
not good !
neither welcoming nor particularly smart .
i then continued to the menu where the food looked very appetizing .
the wait staff due sit down service is okay .
i used my cc to secure the room .
got my confirmation email .
got another confirmation email on november 10th .
very rude customer service !
not okay .
we checked out early , heading to starbucks for a drink and wi-fi .
just not ok at all .
awful place to stay .
no customer service .
management does nothing to make people return .
Negative
not exactly what you want to be the first experience with a new stylist .
they didnt get it done on saturday either .
worst by far .
car finally done then it comes back with dirt all over the door .
all they do is trying to sell you extended warranty .
apparently he thought it unnecessary .
i went back in and purchased a _num_ '' box mesquite .
the tree had been there for over two months prior to my purchase .
both dried out and died .
still need some more herbs though .
we 've been to fountain hills theater several times and always enjoyed ourselves .

the short version , my house went on the market and sold within days .
it is n't just about money .
so fast forward now to march _num_ .
frustration .

horrible customer service .
the whole time he 's giving me attitude .
avoid at all cost .
no warranty either .
this company was formerly called h k motors .

i will not be returning .
you will waste your money
however there are negatives that out way the positives .
worst service ever !
did not like at all .
i 'd give them _num_ stars if i could .
looks like it 's time for me to find a new dentist .
ugh .
personally , i have n't gone back cuz of the amount of discomfort experienced .
there was a lot of other weird stuff , too .
i dropped off my documents a month before the tax due date .
i was referred from a friend to use monica to handle my back taxes .
at first she seemed very helpful and said she could work on my issues .
sent my tax information to them in early march .
not a word from them .
they do n't even deserve one star .
this place is horrible !
i 'm not too familiar with driving around tempe .
i could n't find it .
nasty customer service today .
i have been shopping here for years and have never been treated like this .
poor customer service .
garcia 's has typical mexican food , perhaps a bit better than macayo 's .
she just gave me a price range of $ _num_ `` on up '' .
but no !
so rude .
drinks arrived quickly and we opted to wait for our friends before ordering .
sushi is garbage .
parking was fairly easy , and only $ _num_ .
- atmosphere !
not family friendly .
this stadium is terrible .
very different from camelback ranch , people can get very close to the players .
ca n't see a thing .
no one cares .
first , this is my favorites sub factory location .
not going back .
miss original crew .
everything is slow !
new name same place , i got the club sandwich .
she gave me a free soda .
seriously and i had been wanting to try this place for a long time .
not so .
nothing to write home about .
you can get way better stuff packaged from a grocery store .
first bite was an okay mix of sauce , cheese and sausage .
i believe their salad came standard with the italian dressing though .
my cannelloni was drowned a rose sauce and was nothing memorable .
very disappointing .
frozen seafood , small portions , so-so service and staff not knowing the menu .
i was really disappointed .
i would not recommend dining here .
i think olive garden is better than this .
i remind him i had ordered a dinner salad with ranch .
at this point , we just want to leave .
they probably thought i was dipping them ... i apologized and went back immediately .
beware of pump number _num_ .
just my luck .
wrong !
probably because she was due to give birth in aisle _num_ within moments .
if you want to find it , try another store . ''
i 'm not coming back .
my bad .
this was my second visit to this location .
i just do n't like this location .
_num_ .
i 've caught this _num_ times and they have had to correct it .
this is a health hazard and extremely dangerous for the elderly and children .
in recent purchases , tried some of their iced coffee and a mocha latte .
the coffee is terrible .
its bitter and has a funky aftertaste .
terrible .
rude .
she just kept asking anything else , anything else to rush us along .
she was just unpleasant .
while we were getting ice cream , my husband was looking for cannoli .
wtf whole foods ?
rude and unprofessional staff .
no apologies .
Negative
Neutral
whenever i get packs of whole food market waters i get _num_ % off .
even manager was confused .
we just left the store mad .
i 'm a vegetarian and there was bacon in the potato salad .
signage would have been nice .
also my mom had chicken salad and walnuts in it .
this was at 7pm folks , not close to close .
for example , the flavor had been cooked out of the edamame .
i will not recommend this place .
so disappointed .
me and the husband walk into the store .
you should try other stores .
me ( in my head ) - what the heck does that mean .
this is not stated up front .
instead of hair that is shoulder length it 's several inches above .
i purchased a groupon coupon , called and made an appointment .
lame .
my hair was long , almost close to my behind .
most of the services are decent but not spectacular .
the receptionists are usually not bright enough to actually schedule an appointment correctly .
i was furious and stressed out beyond belief .
no way .
the salon is under new management and so is the school .
it 's like russian roulette going in there !
blah blah blah .
i can afford ( and deserve ) better haircuts from experienced professionals now .
it 's my lunch hour !
waste of money .
the manager of this location is nothing more than a jerk .
not just the everything bagels but the entire rack behind the counter .
no flavor .
no idea .
have the owners from here ever even had a bagel from back east ?
no thanks .
skip this one .
cons : microwaved eggs , microwaved bacon .
only packets on the counter .
i 'm never going back .
also they recently changed from butter to some butter - like spread .
disappointed .
they never have plain bagels when i go .
what bagel shop never has enough plain bagels on a saturday or sunday morning ?
drives me nuts and has happened on _num_ separate occasions .
had a bacon egg and cheese on a salt bagel this morning .
i used to really like this place .
i am from back east i know .
such a shame .
you get all this for $ _num_ .
honestly , for a cheap piece of meat it was pretty okay .
will not go back - ever .
overpriced and just not tasty food .
with all the hype and advertising it was only natural to try outback .
it was a tuesday night , and we were seated immediately .
companion # _num_ ordered a bowl of potato soup .
no complaints were heard .
companion # _num_ ordered the cesar salad .
for main courses , companion # _num_ ordered a medium bacon cheeseburger .
service ... not very attentive .
my husband made a comment about how he remembers outback being so much better .
just not for me .
it was horrible .
if i could leave less than one star i would .
i will not be back here .
manager was standing around .
sure people could 've been cut .
i remained in such just because it 's not the end of the world .
we were beyond disappointed .
are you kidding me ?
what a mistake !
my steak was cold , and over done .
filthy , poorly trained employees .
extremely disappointed .
)
they wont leave you alone .
hence my visits to arizona mills .
but i did find a diamond in the rough .
ugh .
i suggest going anywhere else other than here , if you possibly can !
tempe thinks it won by getting az mills .
slowly but surely this mall has taken a nose dive .
stores selling quality merchandise can not survive here .
really crowded on the weekends .
if you want to walk fast , it 's impossible .
knock off merchandise vendors inside do n't help this place either .
it 's the people there that scare me .
every time i go to this mall i experience the same things .
it 's a bit rough here to say the least !
there are many new shops and not many i would really want to visit .
i would not recommend it .
this mall is horrible .
ca n't drink out there until _num_ or , something .
this facility has really gone down hill .
the crowds and clientele just kill this place for me .
went the the aquarium with my daughter and dinner at rainforest cafe .
two of them had their shirts off .
how disgusting !
( who does n't like a good discount ?
anyway , the stores are okay because the prices are decent .
the choices here suck .
lame !
i had to wait _num_ min .
terrible customer service !
really disappointed foot locker .
not my type of etiquette .
finally , the doctors teeth are kind of busted .
ordered from papa johns when staying in phoenix .
very disappointing .
not acceptable .
boyfriend got a breakfast burrito , i got a shredded beef burrito .
went here with a friend for lunch today .
i ordered two crunchy ground beef tacos and a grilled chicken quesadilla .
the quesadilla was n't much better .
sunday afternoon , around _num_ pm .
had chicken and steak tacos .
it makes me sad .
bad food , worse service .
ugh .
grossed my ass out .
sorry , not drunk .
they just waited there with a blank look on their face until we ordered .
the restroom is disgusting .
i have been calling around to various bakeries around the valley about wedding cakes .
they only use italian butter cream , that tastes like cool whip .
very rude people !
rude !
actually you do n't .
frosting had very little taste to it .
disgusting .
ya i want smoke smell on my organic food .
i am huge fan of cheap taco shops and will try just about any .
they also charge for chips and salsa .
lame .
this is that place next to the rei off of southern avenue .
they even messed up a veggie burrito .
poor excuse for salsa bar .
the beef itself was like one long piece of beef .
it was like the yarn ball of shredded beef inside my taco .
one tip for the owners : is the gigantic tv really necessary ?
also , get better coffee .
hubby ate even less of his .
cashier was very mildly polite , not too much well known english .
( _num_ sets on _num_ rolled tacos . )
pretty average for your hole in the wall mexican joint .
prices are cheap and the food is `` meh '' .
the service is average too , nothing really special about it .
we walked in ready to order our lunch .
and trust me , they are n't always good .
i 've had food truck food better than this .
the prices were unbelievable .
they obviously do n't try to improve the quality of food .
i ordered an asada arizona burrito and a quesadilla .
bummer with a _num_ year old .
Negative
the power was out for a few hours .
we stayed _num_ nights , our room was cleaned once .
meaning , anyone could have entered the room with a key .
there was loud talking outside my window during the night .
overall i was not happy .
very disappointing .
i have a very demanding job , and the mornings are tough .
it is quite tricky to get off to a decent start without water .
management is awful !
worst complex ever .
_num_ .

also the rent if very high for what you are getting .
i 'm just not that impressed .
even she was n't impressed .
i am not your bro .
i ordered the steak and shrimp a _num_ dollar meal .
after a total of _num_ hour walking into the restaurant i get my meal .
this was not the case .
my onion rings were thin and mostly crispy .
the manager then offered to cook me `` another bag of clam chowder '' .
i 'd probably steer clear of this restaurant , at least for this location .
so disappointed !
just awful !
shame .
... no silverware also .
anyways , it 's the normal looking joe 's with merchandise to buy .
nothing to write home about .
not good .
not a lot of taste .
not a real fan .
my wife had the spaghetti lobster .
so she did n't eat it .
was n't at all impressed .
plus he gave use a few coupons for free appetizers .
not impressed at all .
disappointed .
did n't finish it either .
manager looks lost .
no direction .
find out my outside server is actually the bartender !
it was a saturday night and i ordered king crab legs and a sangria .
i stomach turned right after i finished my last bite .
minor problems , i figured .
bartender and staff were very friendly .
maybe the other customers learned their lesson already ?
the clam strips where nothing more that a batch of fried batter .
the potatoes were undercooked .
not a fan .
never great service , however tonight we were seated right away .
we handed out menus back .
but clearly did n't care .
a bit ignored tonight .
on my latest visit i ordered a dish of crab stuffed shrimp .
our appetizer came late so they gave it to us for free .
bad experience .
tough lobster nice talkative waiter .
why does she not know the menu .
management doesnt care .
servers do n't care .
food bad .
never going back .
not impressed .
not paying $ _num_ .
fried fish , crab cakes , _num_ stuffed shrimp , fries , onion strings .
the shrimp were shrimp , and what chef puts fries and onion strings together .
when we brought it to there attention they brought out more crab same thing .
waste of money .
very disappointed .
my roommate and i had been ordering from this place for over a year .
are you kidding me ?
delivery time was accurate ... so that i ca n't complain about .
too bad !
just a sad day .
the driver was polite and friendly .
the crab puffs were ok .
tasted a little off too .
had egg foo young and that was dripping with oil .
yep it was not good .
the soup was the only item that arrived hot .
not worth it .
lastly , the pork chow mein .
about six months ago , i ordered the mongolian beef .
it was literally too sweet to eat much of it .
the delivery guy kept trying to look into my house .
he was just looking over my head and trying to look inside .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it was a mess .
the food sucked .
the crab puff had cream cheese in just one corner .
horrible parking .
but it was bad .
i 'm really displeased and regret getting it cut .

do n't even bother !
big mistake .
terrible .
disappointing .
frustrating .
do n't the owners care ?

i took my _num_ honda civic to just brakes on broadway in tempe .
the cheap pads just brakes installed are junk and do n't last .
do n't cheap out .
oh and go figure , i do know what i 'm talking about .
mind you this is past _num_ at night and the customer is waiting inside .
by _num_ , i left .
i pick up my car and that was that .
the whole idea of applebee 's really bothers me .
well , i feel the same way about that restaurant too .
i miss it .
so corporate , cheesy , and generic .
)
it 's an american chain restaurant .
not a fan of this location .
prices were not bad .
waitress was not very attentive .
will never come back there and would never recommend .
my three cheese chicken pasta had lettuce in it .
there were about _num_ pieces .
that was a direct quote .
worst bartender ever !
he continued serving drinks to customers using the same ice .
horrible service !
on a side note if you like cold chicken wings your in luck .
wings were borderline warm .
worst service ever !
we all went in for a meal and were seated instantly near the bar .
all our food was cold .
since i never got a refill i ate my meal without water .
how ridiculous is that ?
our server was totally avoiding us .
worst service ever .
do n't go here after 9pm .
the worst .
also , this ross just seems to be more cramped than others .
a total mess !
no customer service .
what we 'd hoped would mean quick service was anything but .
not even quite okay but just blah .
also my wife ordered a chocolate malt .
it tasted more like a chocolate sunday instead of a malt .
my daughter commented that the lettuce tasted almost frozen .
Neutral
not worth it at all .
the service is s l o w !
as if to say , '' you 're not my table '' .
not at _num_ & diner .
avoid at all costs !
i was not overly impressed .
service was incredibly slow .
no apologies for lack of service .
i got $ _num_ groupon for $ _num_ .
not to mention the food is over priced for the quality as well !
it simply does n't impress me with its service or its food .
garbage !
wrong .
and this after making me wait to talk to a rep .
i have been having connection issues in tempe for _num_ weeks .
brittany needs to be fired .
( though i did have an appointment ) .
i called customer service at least _num_ times .
i walked into this store to have my phone checked .
Very negative
i 've been a customer for many years now .
please consider any other company to finance a new home .
that 's why i accepted the offer instead of others i had .
this was approximately four weeks after we were to close .
what poor customer service !
oh , and it 's super expensive .
limited selection of stuff to by across the board .
put your money down and they stuff you .
spring rolls , crab rangoon , maybe some rice to go with .
actually , i take that back , denny 's is probably better .
bad idea .
but everything else was n't .
there is usually ample seating , so getting a table never takes long .
so i 'm dropping them down to _num_ stars .
horrible experience !
service was horrible .
order was wrong .
would not recommend this place save your money .
not cool !
i want the food cooked correctly .
way wrong !
false .
i just would n't have walked out .

their diagnosis was was that i needed maintenance on the unit .
disgusting .
the front desk says it is probably someone smoking outside .
wi-fi is slow .
later that week , our room smelled really strongly of cigarette smoke .
so i 'm off to building _num_ .
they just wan na get rid of you and charge you .
my manicure was horrible .
)
not worth the price .
the woman who was working with me began by giving me ice cold water .
like she gave me hang nails and cut me .
and the worst part ?
horrible experience .
i would gladly go to other locations though .
the guac is n't good .
ask them to put more in , the cook will just stare at you .
no chip refill .
there is a plastic fork laying in one of the salsa containers .
but i did not listen .
`` best mexican food in arizona , california , new mexico '' ?
the food came out relatively quickly and the portions were quite generous .
i stopped going here the second time i got an incorrectly rolled burrito .
the name of the place is filibertos and the entire staff is mexican !
wan na add rice or beans ?
place is just nasty dirty !
ugh .
this is not the first time .
seems only one person works at this time .
too slow !
not going back .

the potatoes were n't fully cooked .
i 'm not a huge fan .
the staff is n't overly friendly inside .

: ( disappointed .
it 's not hard to get things right that are that simple .
i do n't get it .
( for the record , i have an az license with an il address .
( the drinks are even a little cheaper ) .
just called to see what food they still cooked late night .
not thinking i need to come back .
the outside seating is present , but totally taken up by smokers .
overall , i wish the customer service was better .
yelp says _num_ stars means `` meh .
well , i want to explain why i 've had better .
only one lady at the counter was taking orders .
no open indoor seating .
waste of space .
( our book club needed _num_ seats ! )
i had to nurse it for fear of a sugar brain freeze .
college , i mean .
but , i ca n't .
yeah , i think i would keep on driving .
( _num_ 1/2 stars ) .
i want it plain , strong , and hot .
second failure !
is n't it summer break ?
it 's just not that good .
Negative
*the internet connection here is aweful .
this coffee is awful .
its evident the owner is buying the cheapest beans available .
but they wont miss me .
smokers ruin the atmosphere .
the outside reeks of cigarette smoke .
do n't attempt any work by phone though , the area is too noisy .
i 'm sorry .
just does nothing for me .
i like to layout but its always crowded and hard to find a table .
worst customer service ever .
the second employee walked away and the first continued chatting .
i wish i was kidding , but this seriously happened in this establishment .
this place is hit or miss .
every other time i 've ever been here i get the grumpy barista .
very poor customer service .
i 'm not likely to recommend this joint .
why _num_ stars ?
my girlfriend and i stopped here because of the high yelp review .
the tofu was disgusting .
ick !
the noodles were really hard .
food was not as flavorful .
had dessert too coconut custard with rice .
not impressed .
gross .
the noodles i 'm sure were spaghetti .
this place is horrible .
it was n't enjoyable .
we were given soup with cabbage in it for starters .
very bland .
i sure do remember the fish pieces being alot bigger .
i later found out the standard progressive is $ _num_ with our insurance .
he told his assistant to hurry up because it 's busy saturdays .
i went to the az mills mall in tempe az .
the bathrooms were disgusting .
find a real place to get your prescription lenses .
worst service ever .
not a helpful staff .
what the hell ?
( you can not speak to a living breathing human being ) .
this office never sent in my daughters records .
was not impressed with this school .
this school is just a daycare ... thats it .
i might go back here and just do noodles and sauce .
why not just charge one price for all ?
the selection was meat , pork , chicken and fish .
it was shaved , and was kinda tough .
more salad topping stuff then anything else .
the staff here was friendly and helpful , i will give them that .
but wait ... free frozen yogurt !
that 's ridiculous .
gross .
so gross .
i highly suggest not eating here .
what a disappointment !
i immediately noticed that this building was in serious need of some work .
sorry for misleading !
i go to the grocery store for food i can purchase and eat .
the employees are super nice and the lines are short .
they do n't even carry sriracha anymore .
staff lacks compassion .
even the diarrhea had crusted and dried .
avoid this hobby shop .
terrible customer service .
this place is not good .
the guy had major attitude too .
a little disturbing , too ... .
think like _num_ in normal terms , maybe .
do not recommend .
received a note that my package as at this location .
pathetic enterprise company .
like , really awful .
the staff is very mean and definitely not afraid to yell at their customers .
everything else stinks !
clerk asked for my id and continued with the sale .
there are many more reputable businesses in the area that have cheaper prices .
i came in at midnight tonight to do some shopping .
so i thought whatever and started my shopping .
i will not be back .
they could add more self checkout lines but they 're to cheap .
horrible shopping experience !
then it happened again ... and a check was never cut .
horrible organization .
probably nothing !
ridiculous !
the only way to get their attention is demanding answer from someone in charge .
walking into the store , sometimes there is a security person who is watching .
so very disappointed and frustrating .
when you make it too sweet for someone 's personal tastes , fix it .
it 's not even clean .
this person was not myself .
that is completely unacceptable .
i 've never heard of this procedure before and the price was outrageous !
this is awful service .
_num_ ) called to schedule an appointment without problem .
i check my calendar and correct that we scheduled for a 1pm .
_num_ ) i to my appointment and fill out the paperwork needed .
do not recommend this practice .
they said they would only email her copies .
do not i repeat do not go here .
the cookies were ok , nothing special .
chicken caesar salad and they forget the chicken ?
the employees are incompetent .
do n't believe me ?
of if your friends were more like mine , a tv with rabbit ears .
but that does n't happen .
would not recommend this place .
greasy and loud .
it is really , really hard to top erica o .
disappointing place .
i guess this was an ok place to hang out .
Negative
talk about horrible service !
staff is rude .
then the staff tries to over charge you .
nothing more than `` tolerable '' .
will not be going there ever again !
they recently have remodeled the club house .
foot golf is encouraged after 9:00 on weekends .
this golf course is as low rent as they come .
terrible .
the country club itself shows its age , and so do the patrons .
not safe !
not fun or safe .
too bad .
craving some food .
and tonight ?
only way to even get appetizers is to go to the bar and order .
the appearance is tacky and not groomed .
we also had a problem with ants getting in for random things .
the office hour is not reasonable .
opposite the soup counter they have a small frozen yogurt vending machine .
and add another two dollars if you want chicken on that already pricey salad .
i am not a fan .
we also tried the pineapple upside down cake , eh so , so !
i like the new look but hate the confusing new set up .
i went online to check the balance , then called the customer service # .
all they can do was take down my information and someone will contact me .
that was _num_ weeks ago .
pretty terrible .
hell no .
i have been to better sweet tomatoes .
buffet serving tables and serving utensils had been slammed by a previous sunday rush .
on my visit i opted for the basics .
it became clear that my girls were correct in how they were treated .
i just felt awful !
i wish i took a video to show how every puppy looked .
but i only grabbed a pic of the first few .
too busy closing to provide customer service !
too noisy and not enough good beer .
Neutral

she said she could go to the back and get us some .
much , much worse !
it was very unprofessional .
disgusting and totally unsanitary .
if she reads this she will know exactly what i 'm talking about .
the atmosphere is low key .
the first time i went the service was good for a cheap price .
false advertising .
my wife did not get better .
i could n't afford both .
do not see this doctor .
no longer a fan .
the first time i visited the store the staff were friendly and helpful .
stay away .
do you research prior to purchasing and getting anything installed at this location .
went in seeking some spare gas tanks and water tanks .
very rude .
that _num_ nuggets per sauce .
that 's unacceptable .
my friends and i stopped here for breakfast en route to the nascar race .
horrible customer service .
and apparently all the employees have a hard time hearing .
i 'm not stupid .
i guess pickles and onions sound the same .
f these guys .
worst experience ever !
so i 'm driving and all of a sudden i have a blow out .
wrong !
i went in to get two new tires put on my car .
i was quoted $ _num_ .
which totaled to around $ _num_ and i 'm okay with paying that .
this is unacceptable .

_num_ .
it still tastes better than starbucks i guess and it 's close to home .
rude .
thats not `` cigar smoker friendly '' at all !
i went in here tonight with the bf .
the grande was really big , kind of expensive though .
the place was crowded with people stopping in .
it was alright , but it tasted a little gritty to me .
coffee is ok , i 've had better .
rude .
two stars seem kind of low , but the description of `` meh .
this was the first time that i have visited this place .
it seemed cramped and small with all of the people stuffed in there .
just so-so for a coffee place .
not a bit of it in this one .
we would not have called back if it had n't .
very disappointing .
i had a work meeting here recently and spent several hours hanging out here .
so not appealing !
_num_ stars , hands down .
it tasted like straight syrup .
i 've had to wait in line while they watch videos together .
not anymore .
it was horrible .
i 'm back again .
_num_ ) there must be a time range ( ie .
my deposit was $ _num_ .
get there at _num_ and decide to pass the time by getting a bite .
_num_ .
_num_ .
also the food there isnt the greatest .
probably would n't notice .
the customer service is deplorable , though .
those days are long gone .
man this place has gone down .
it was around _num_ and there were beer bottles around the games downstairs .
just bad .
Negative
management , get your shit together .
complete waste of money .
are you kidding me ?
it 's ridiculous .
the ticket and card buying system is a little bit complicated .
i just would n't spend money here again .

on the two player games only one player worked .
the customer service was so-so .
not cool .
this place should be called joke works .
avoid .
i was so wrong !

terrible billing dept !
slow .
do yourself a favor , find some other provider .

i never had these problems with our pediatrician in texas .
after in network adjustment , i owe $ _num_ .
as was the idea of buying a road bike .
but , after saving up and doing some research i was off ... .
very disappointing .
not impressed .
cheap bikes for the average joe , and limited inventory .
it was pretty standard fare , nothing spectacular .
i though by looking at the food the manager would be shocked .
went in at breakfast time it was semi busy .
ugh .
please get me out of here .
worst service ever .
have eaten here before , but today will be our last .
the only fresh thing might be the boiled egg .
rude .
skip this place .
there was a giant roach in the wall .
its not fair !
were is the staff & maintenance people when this happens ?
to anyone who reads this , please read the ten filtered post .
go down to the bottom of this page under the last review listed .
there had literally not been even a small courtesy notice .
management only acted on my complaints after i had called the cops .
no action from management .
i have been renting places for a decade now .
so i paid for it and sat to down to wait .
pizza in the garbage .
but after awhile , you just got to call it what it is .
disappoint .
i am assuming cause it is in tempe ( a college town ) .
without any taste to keep them in business .
does this even have pizza sauce ?
it happens , i get it .
trying to get someone 's attention to ask a question is next to impossible .
turkey sandwich , flavorless .
something is wrong here.
went in for spaghetti with marinara .
venezia 's is not authentic italian .
i ordered a medium size so i could take some home for leftovers .
now , after all that , the pizza was very ... ordinary .
overall bad .
_num_ .

very much like a pizza dough you 'd buy from a grocery store .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the toppings are not all equal quantity .
_num_ .
all the toppings fell off and it arrived cold !
Neutral

i 'm not too sure we 'll be ordering from here again .
drove _num_ miles to try the pizza again .
not a fan .

Negative
he said we always put tire pressure at what came from factory .
rip off !
$ _num_ part .
do n't trust this business .
no apology , no refund , no nothing .
they just want to suck money from us .
that day , they also suggested we get our `` rotors replaced '' .
chains like this ( e.g .
( the other guy at the counter was nice though .
terrible .
so i scheduled an appt for the next day .
i basically gave them _num_ for nothing .
_num_ on your side could care less .
_num_ stars .
anyway , they said they could squeeze me in .
very disappointed .
of course not , cause they need the money .
this place is crap .
not good enough .
3rd time ; my husband comes too .
really ?
so unfair .
waste of time .
horrible ... .
all they want is to get you out as quick as they can .
the staff seem like they were hired off the streets .
the one down the street is better in my opinion .
no call .
she was n't very friendly .
state farm then provided us another provider to correct the ding in the windshield .
this place was so weird !
this place sucks .
not so .
looks are n't everything .
the only people here have a mean age of _num_ .
we significantly bring this average down .
maybe you could use it as a paper weight ?
it was cold .
god bless the edit button , i 'll have to come back with something .
my order came with soup , i chose lentil .
this was the first mediterranean place i had in az .
gross .

they do not have ginger ale .
only _num_ tables had diners .
we were n't greeted at the door very quickly .
disappointing .
other friends says eh food .
unbelievable .
this place is _num_ stars at most .
i had the spaghetti and meatballs .
i mean really , what can you do to spaghetti .
the garlic bread was white ( that means raw dough ) .
the sauce horrible .
super irritating .
but i disappointed .
it tasted like jar salsa .
nothing special .
service was not the best .
i ordered two ground beef tacos with just meat and cheese .
i could have made way better tacos at home .
check out my review for los taquitos in phoenix for a much better option .
not worth the visit .
wasnt worth the money i spent .
i will not be going back anytime soon .
the water taste bad .
i did take a photo and the difference is obvious .
came in this past sunday , chips and salsa were alright .
not good !
made me very sad .
no bueno .
stopped in for a bit of a jewelry emergency .
i will not be back .
the sales agent was very deceiving in the transaction .
it was thin and crispy and cut into little bite size pizzas .
it was more like a pizza flavored quesadilla than an actual pizza .
you have been warned .
had a not so good experience at nello 's .
we ordered a chicken parmigiana sammy and a spinach , mushroom , onion pie .
mr lucy bit into his slice of pie was was laughing .
this restaurant was just okay to me .
i ordered a thin crust and it was just average .
the staff was friendly , so that was a plus .
not too pleased .
this was my third experience with nellos .
what a mistake .
this was my first visit .
thick , deep crust pizza with good chunks of buffalo chicken .
overall , their food is ok , i 'd just stick with the pizza .
particularly their pepperoni pineapple pizza .
not old ... but certainly not freshly made .
i 'll probably be visiting the mesa location from now on .
_num_ stars for service , _num_ star for food .
ridiculous .
beer was even flat .
oregano 's blows this place away .
the garlic bread was drenched in oil .
six customers in the place .

the food was poor .
made me want to order papa johns .
my hubby likes to sit at the bar and order the chicken enchilada pizza .

ridiculous !
there is just something so weird tasting about it .
i left thoroughly unimpressed .
there were n't many vegetables on my veggie mountain pizza .
again , disappointing .
he refunded the road kill pizza , but not the other items .
totally disappointing .
the wings on the menu were described as jumbo but quite the opposite also .
extremely poor !
the pizzas are inconsistent .
immediately to the trash .
rude manager .
to me , that means old , cold popcorn .
it was disgusting .
ca n't say i 'll be going back .
okay , kinda expensive , but i get it .
not imax quality .
not worth $ _num_ .

i knew az mills was ghetto ... .
all coats except one , which was marked at $ _num_ .
ordered something from a very helpful gentlemen last saturday .
updated _num_ .
dropped them off and went on with my work day .
wrong !
it was loud and chaotic .
when finally acknowledged by the owner , i explain the situation again .
this is appalling .
as someone who is a customer service manager , this is never okay .
not me !
i had a chicken chimichanga because it was their $ _num_ lunch special .
terrible .
longest wait in a drive thru ever .
it 's a friggin coffee - plain - same size every friggin time .
this place sucks .
eh ?
the only starbucks i know that can screw up an americano every time .
my goal is taste not volume , is that hard to understand ?
what a mess !
very disappointing .
only then would he listen to me .
staff was extremely unprofessional .
they never get your order right , even the tots suck here .
ordered a strawberry slush , watermelon slush , cherry slush , and coke slush .
ugh .
never planning on ordering from here again .
recently i ordered a standard cheeseburger combo with a slush .
they really know how lower standards .
i came in for lunch around 1pm , my order came around $ _num_ .
no reason ?
which does n't happen often .
being a former employee of sonic i know how busy it can get .
the employees were rude .
do n't frequent if your in a rush .
they never include sauces that should be included with meals .
i have never been to a slower fast food restaurant before .
just gross .
long wong 's was like that , for example .
lame '' ) .
the food is all grease and fat .
the quality of the ingredients used is all very low .
fries are made more of oil than potato .
lame .
what a terrible experience .
food was slow .
service was terrible .
really disappointing .
ranch with the wings ( not offered the choice ) ?
i might however bring my own blue cheese .
fridays , chile 's , etc . )
i have been here _num_ times .
the wait staff was friendly and the wings were great .
ordered a pizza from them for the 1st time tonight .
we had pizza , wings , salad , and some beer .
the pizza tasted fairly plan and very greasy .
it 's almost like there is too much breading on them .
just get takeout .
because the service is a hit or a miss .
my first visit , the servers were very attentive .
my worst experience ever .
tasted like buffalo sauce .
service was poor .
wrong !

well , beads galore international in phoenix , az did it to me .
terrible .
low quality .
never going back .
gross !
terrible customer service .
the exact date and time should be in the notes from those calls .
the place smells like a burning tire when you walk in .
the salsa was alright too .
i ordered a beef tostada and a beef taco .
so gross .
the beans were nasty .
not the refried beans im used to .
this place makes taco bell look like a _num_ star gourmet restaurant .
shame !
it did n't feel clean .
just not a good experience .
not worth even _num_ star !
this place sucks .
no value whatsoever .
forget about it as they ca n't deal with it .
even then they could n't get it right .
at least their food is cheap and usually hot !
it 's a crazy mixed up world out there , kids .
plus , they also fill up your tires .
i 'll leave the more expensive stuff to my ever so trustworthy mechanic .
my husband received a coupon via email for $ _num_ off an oil change .
they do n't even deserve _num_ star .
i had to go to _num_ different mechanics to have it fixed .
avoid this place .
they need new management or ownership in order to stay in business .
walked out spending $ _num_ .
do n't go to this place .
worst experience ever .
totally ripped off .
_num_ bucks for the same oil change i get at the dealership for _num_ .
i could smell my shrimp before it even entered my mouth .
not to mention , the owner is a complete bitch !
the sesame chicken is flavorful , but a bit on the dry side .
i really try to be understanding about food taking some time .
i am very willing to wait for quality food .
btw , what is it with chinese places and duck sauce ?
if you only get it when you order duck , fine .
very large portions , but also very pricey .
not anymore .
so annoying .
and fried rice was very oily and with frozen veggies : ( .
i also ordered chicken chow mein .
chinese corn , mushroom , the big peas .
chicken was normal .
the restrooms were n't kept clean enough .
online ordering is apparently a gamble .
i 'm never gon na eat at this location ever .
they just said we have not had anyone else tell us .
went here for lunch today to get mongolian beef .
to top it off , i paid for the dinner portion .
big mistake .
i finally walked up to them to see if they could assist me .
again , horrible !
literally , the next day my hands were sore .
went here for lunch and opened the place up at 11am .
the salsa and chips were the highlight .
the exception was the menudo , which my wife said was super excellent .
i am always checking mexican restaurants for the food and the heat .
_num_ .
if you want a larger , second basket , it costs $ _num_ .
_num_ .
they were really friendly though .
standard rice , standard beans .
i passed it by laying down for two hours .
it 's located on the left side further south .
the rice and beans were probably the best thing i ate there .
just awful .
no rice , no beans .
there 's a taco bell down the street with a higher rating .
tried this place tonight because husband loves it .
food was gross .
my kids love it here but they only eat bean burritos .
it 's just mushy .
terrible food .
do n't bother .
very mediocre .
the beans are homemade so that was a plus .
it takes forever for them to take your order or bring your food out .
-the decor is awful !
the food was bad .
also the salsa is too spicy for kids to eat .
overall i was disgusted .
horrible .
sat in bar as i travel often for work .
do n't believe the hype .
the service is horrible .
prices are fine but you get a better meal at taco bell .
not kidding .
it 's terrible .
no big deal .
left _num_ minutes later .
terrible service .
it 's a little better than this place .
horrible .
it was literally a wrapped corn tortilla in `` sauce '' .
what the hell ?
ceilings tiles are broken .
i am not one to complain .
sorry for bad review .
if you need cleaning , find another cleaner .
the event i had to wear the dress for was that sunday !
apparently she is their daughter and is being groomed to take over .
geez get over yourself buddy !
horrible customer service .
sent me away to get change .
horrible .
never go back .
Negative
do not come to this business .
wrong .
horrible service !
highly disappointed !
as the manager approached i opened the tank for her to see .
since i still had questions , don promised to return the call .
two hours passed without a phone call so i contacted the store again .
i was thinking minor work nothing major .
scare tactics is want brake masters is about .
next stop : jiffy lube !
brake masters never even checked !
i just bought a car they just repaired four days ago .
so i searched for a car with a/c .
apparently they too are aware of the quality of their work .
like i was asking him to do my taxes .
please , i would like to know .
mountain dew sucked though .
she ruined my day .
my sandwich had onions , tomatoes , and bacon on it .
soggy , falling apart and flavorless .
ca n't follow instructions .
i would not recommend this location .
good thing i 'm not vegetarian !
if you are looking something convenient , this might be a good place .
was not friendly at all .
not worth the calories .
it just bummed me out .
this is not the store for me .
maybe if i was a fish person i 'd be more excited here .
i will not be returning .
this is unfortunate .
the ironic thing is that these employees seem to really know fish well .
it did n't surprise me .
bottom line , i wish this store was better .
such a fool i am , duh ?
i will not be returning .
for the next week , everything in the store is _num_ % off .
it 's chipped more and more , and this is _num_ days in .
skip it .
the bad news ?
i 'm a server .
worst salon ever .
just because its cheap dont do it .
there 's other salons that only charge _num_ bucks more for way better service .
horrible gel polish job !
unbelievable .
i 'm going to have to hide my hands .
ugh .
so awkward .
they were not dry .
as he was doing my nails , it all seemed fine .
it 's awful .
bad first impression .
on the second visit , the attitude seemed to change .
maybe we were mistaken , but their attitude seemed really strange .
nothing special about them .
$ _num_ for a pedicure .
what 's a `` bed tax '' ?
_num_ ) housekeeping staff were pleasant and working hard .
they upgraded the tv 's , but not the tv signal .
so even the good stations do n't look good .
our room was dark and dingy even with all of the lights on .
the mattress fell through the frame .
she went back over there and asked if she could search the shuttle .
so , my husband ended up taking a cab to the hotel .
end result is that they literally kicked him out of the hotel .
we stayed for one night and it was a last minute decision .
this is a large facility with major conference facilities attached .
never returning again .
that is an absolute joke !
this place is terrible .
you never actually get seen at your appointment time .
the receptionist did not look at me .
are you kidding me ?
sorry , docs .
get your act together and maybe your patients will be content .
seems a little shady to me .
but be sure they do before you let them do your exam .
now , this is foam and vinyl not brain surgery .
this is business _num_ .
nothing would make me happier than finding good indian food in the phoenix area .
seriously , two bucks each for a little thing of rice with our entrees .
not overly impressed .
also , i ordered my entree mild to medium .
my quest for indian food in the valley continues .
popped in just after noon , its not busy .
i request a booth and decide on the buffet .
i cut open the first piece of chicken and it was uncooked .
now , we all like tuna , sushi style .
what the hell !
gross .
the only vegetables included potatoes and an occasional pea .
what a horrible experience !
what a disappointment !
a shady place .
the food was horrible .
the place was nice looking though .
neither do i anymore .
still no .
beware of terrible service .
bad attitude .
i finished the transaction not wanting to argue .
everyone there is much nicer , in my opinion .
last mechanic to see it was rei tech .
and it comes with the free freak show with `` everyday low prices '' .
i have a list of things i need for my upcoming trip .
my issue is n't with the local rei , but with rei in general .
he brought out some trail shoes for me to try on .
how about the extra cash i spent to get it quickly the first time ?
it seems like it 's becoming a trend at this location .
i got white tips and im not too impressed .
i went there because of the high reviews on yelp .
just a top gel coat ?
ya dunno .
the tips would break even before i needed a fill .
i picked out my color and the guy started my manicure .
overall , i would n't return .
sometimes you only have one chance to make a good first impression .
this place was awful .
worst mistake ever .
false advertising much ?
worst quality ever .
do not go to this place !
no biggie .
no apology .
i am never going back .
i have been here a handful of times for gel manicure and pedicure .
terrible !
uneven all over .
it was really depressing .
lol this place !
today is the worst !
worst experience ever !
big mistake !
$ _num_ wasted .
i have used lincoln to service my garage door since the early _num_ 's .
mama 's not happy !
next time i may have to check into somebody else .
very rude !
i find this unacceptable .
horrible service .
i 'm not real anxious about coming back .
i ca n't deny that .
$ _num_ drafts and $ _num_ wells .
just , no .
pathetic .
i 've been meaning to leave a review for a while .
still awful .
this place is dark , dingy and def a dive .
it was hot outside , so it would be a nice break , right ?
no luck .
i ca n't imagine going back again .
no too bad .
cheap bar food and beer .
they can raise your rent on your unit without notice .
it 's crap .
i ordered chicken salad stuffed tomato .
it came out a ham and swiss with turkey on slightly toasted sourdough .
food was mediocre .
not stoked .
i seriously doubt the stylist i saw even had any training .
quality service is terrible .
i called on friday for an update .
my buddy mike and i went here the night before thanksgiving .
ahhh ... the smell of cleaning fluids .
i had the chicken marsala , mike ordered the chicken lasagne .
trying to pick up a pizza and you 're a young female ?
there was very little mozzarella or ricotta cheese in my lasagna .
salad not near the quality of freshness and ingredients of phx .
it 's going to be a long weekend of sausage .
_num_ years ago red devil was bomb .
_num_ straight trash .
then , we have a _num_ month old .
i was totally looking forward to it.
so so gross .
i was totally looking forward to it.
so so gross .
management is incompetent .
my pizza was soggy .
the beer is dirt cheap .
awful service , awful food .
as for the food ... we had chicken alfredo and a pizza .
the crust was insanely chewy to the point of making your jaw hurt .
looks run down .
weird and unpleasant .
needs to be open and would like to quickly survey the place .
was not good .
the spaghetti was ok.
if i come back it will be to try the pizza .
no words !
wrong !
he ate the chicken and left everything else also .
to that end , i just visited this dry cleaners again .
not impressed .
no such luck .
i can not agree with lauren v .
i 'm used to _num_ % and up .
ripoff !
total rip off !
they 're not .
not so much buddy .
$ _num_ my ass .
just go to discount tires .
no sir .
transmission flush not a good idea .
total rip off !
about a month later another tire had a leak .
all i went there for was an oil change , that was all .
i thought my tire was going to fall off .
this place is terrible .
bad service all around .
its terrible !
avoid this place !
worst place ever !
and i only got an oil change .
this big o is shady do n't deal with them .
i bought _num_ tires _num_ months ago with tire protection plan .
zero stars .
no stars !
idiots !
rather than providing free or discounted parts , they put it all on me .
this place is horrible .
it took them _num_ hours to do this .
this place is horrible !
bad customer service !
i 've been to better places in south phoenix than here .
what a horrible experience .
after an inspection , they told her she might need some repairs .
awful service here .
f this place .
not cool .
just no .
ugh .
yelpers , there are lots of other places to live in tempe .
terrible customer service !
its a huge ordeal !
i have not yet received an email .
are you kidding me ?
lived here recently , _num_ years .
the walls were paper thin .
trucks loaded and slammed doors in the middle of the night .
i quit going due to the smell of body odor .
it 's difficult to turn left across broadway at morning rush hour .
so i they `` so called '' went out and fixed everything .
i went there with valley king and we spoke with jasmine .
that was very , very difficult .
do not trust these people .
they were so condescending !
really disappointing .
you had my number , could have called .
i 'm only off on wednesdays to run these errands .
but make sure that dollar is cash so i can pay for my drink .
i 'm giving it _num_ stars , because they serve alcohol .
the decorations were weird , even for christmas .
first the ordering of our food was confusing .
i 'm not done yet .
i 've held off on reviewing this place for awhile now .
like i said , the hot dog was extremely average .
nothing different than you would get off of a typical hot dog vendor .
the fries are awful .
i had a hot dog , fries , and a vanilla malt .
it does n't live up to the hype .
just a hot dog .
cook line is slow .
overall they are not cheap for what you get .
never been impressed by this place despite eating here a half dozen times .
chili dog was average .
chili was below average .
diet dr pepper was more soda water than dr pepper .
sorry , ted .
stop charging for refills , ted 's .
especially chili dogs .
we were disappointed .
the dogs themselves sure did look good when they were being cooked .
very bland .
not even salt .
but we will not be back .
ridiculous .
just be a little more clear next time , ok ?
the onion rings were decent though .
gross .
not a fan .
never again ... .
i also tried the white and polish sausages that other family members were eating .
the charred beef jumbo hot dog i ate was okay .
i would always get the white hot .
kept hearing about this place so tried it .
every week , i try a new restaurant .
having been in the restaurant business for many years , my expectations are high .
ok ... forget it .
they charge $ _num_ per refill .
the onion rings were tasty and diet dr. pepper is always a plus .
i ordered a veggie dog , which i 've had before and is vegetarian .
big disappointment .
nothing special here .
_num_ .
a cheap potato bun does n't cut it .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it was full of grease .
ugh .
the hot dog my man had was nothing great .
my mistake .
and the dog just took over my thoughts anyway .
they never put my dog even on the grill .
loyal ted 's customer for _num_ years .
i never seen six people behind the counter get nothing accomplished .
oh and the food that use to be good not so much .
right from the get go i was a little let down .
there was a line that was fairly long , not outrageous but fairly long .
i typically use arizona import specialists in tempe , az .
it is common practice to test something that has been fixed .
horrible horrible horrible !
let 's try rice king ... ummm ... sure i said .
straight out the 80s .
i could n't take it !
the cashier was friendly , which earned them another star .
it 's crappy .
dead serious .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i am telling the hotel not to recommend this place to any other guests .
i put a _num_ dollar deposit down for reasons beyond me .
i 've worked directly with larry , the owner , in the past .
, though they were brand new .
ridiculous .
very low budget dry cleaner .
one of my shirts came back with a gummy substance on the collar .
not acceptable !
most dry cleaners put those tags through the recommended wash tag etc .
horrible service .
if i were you , i 'd go anywhere but here .
pee .
the service was okay but geez the place smells like pee .
no integrity .
store is empty .
not my name .
nothing odd there right ?
it was really bad .
in my case it was a miss .
long story ... short version ... .
this firm contacted me in regards to my hoa payments .
i sent out a check for that month .
very bad .
not good .
buffalo chicken was like mcdonald 's chicken nuggets .
terrible and inexperienced service .
slow poor service .
you can see almost all of phx from that spot !
not in my humble opinion .
too dark and loud .
will not eat there again .
the view was better than the food and service .
that steak cost $ _num_ .
mediocre .
just bland and boring .
i was very disappointed .
it 's too bad .
service was beyond slow .
salads , not main course .
no apology , nothing .
_num_ star for the view as it is awesome .
never , never , never !
what a gigantic disappointment !
i am a marriott platinum member and have been for years .
just stay away .
sure he visited every other table , but of course not ours .
wasted memories .
my free beer was their citrus beer .
big mistake .
it was n't worth it .
service was terrible .
except the guy filling waters and cleaning plates .
this place is awful .
i 'm a vegetarian so that was really my only option for an entree .
the entree was pathetic !
this restaurant is sadly disappointing .
disappointed over all .
i suggest looking at the whole menu and then asking them to substitute sides .
more like just another restaurant attached to a hotel .
an education of the waitstaff would be helpful .
other parts of the country may be not mind slower service .
but we were put in booth without a view .
service was poor !
the food was good but a little to salty and to much ala carte !
disappointing !
sunset view was _num_ star .
everything else was a _num_ .
cold .
got some fries on the side too , not great .
service was slow .
i 've had better steaks for a way less price .
i opted for the $ _num_ hamburger that amy suggested .
we also each ordered the house salad for an additional $ _num_ .
yesterday i had to kill some small flying thing .
this was a little confusing when i first came here .
anyhow , he fixes the ac , and off i go .
i booked a room with a king size bed .
my colleague and i went out to dinner .
dude , it 's _num_ .
not worth it .
you 've been warned .
key to room failed .
for a marriott , this place sure did disappoint .
at least on a low setting ?
she was clueless .
needless to say , yes , they do have wifi .
he called me and let me know , and i called the hotel .
this was unacceptable .
seems a little backwards to me !
the grand just a few miles away seems like a much better option .
otherwise this would just be another hotel in the desert .
_num_ : the cold breakfast .
and the hash browns were to die for , literally .
_num_ .
the fire alarm actually went off while i was typing this review .
my first time there i ca n't say if i would stay again .
finally around 11:00 am they checked out never to be heard again .
that is unacceptable !
_num_ .
upon entering the pool our bags were searched for alcohol .
anytime the pool manager walked by our area , our bags were searched again .
_num_ .
on the bright side , the spa was fabulous .
i had an _num_ minute massage that rocked my world .
overall , however , i was pretty underwhelmed by this resort .
lunch was slow .
service was dreadful .
ugh .
wow no help and rude .
my room is still not ready !
_num_ hours wasted time .
someone was smoking pot heavily .
there is nothing around the resort though .
there are many better places to stay which will cost less .
first , if you are a non smoker , you will hate it here .
sad to see really .
we will not be back .
it is a low end hotel with a couple of nice features .
i 'm beyond annoyed .
very bad !
pathetic !
it was very unpleasant .
it was n't anything special .
the pools are okay , to many brats by the volleyball pool area .
the room was clean just small .
there were several in our room which made us leave right away .
the customer service is not there .
this is stupid .
problem is still there .
relocated from wisconsin to studio _num_ in tempe , az .
the staff needs major upgrade on customer service skills .
when changing a radiator hose on my own , i opened my radiator .
i was referred to this place by a friend actually .
below par chinese msg .
the white rice was hard and cold .
avoid at all costs .
no more !
horrible !
well big mistake !
surprisingly they agree to sell the car exactly at $ _num_ .
but this is not .
very bad experience .
tempe acura is _num_ miles away from my place .
my mechanic found only one thing on their laundry list of `` problems . ''
this was just like any other pedicure i had gotten anywhere else .
it was the manicure that changed my whole experience .
i purchased and called her for an appointment for my mom and myself .
the things they sale are over priced period .
if you 're looking to buy , go to big _num_ .
worst customer service .
that is not a trim .
so , we shopped , got our groceries and returned at about 6pm .
this hotel is disgusting .
$ _num_ for _num_ nights ?
she took her precious time assisting our group of _num_ .
the stay other wise was so-so ... .
went to the front desk and showed him my bite marks .
the breakfast was gross .
horrible .
this place is disgusting .
they gave it a _num_ star .
this place is disgusting !
hated it !
unacceptable .
no thanks !
no no no .
go to arizona hotel and pool is out of order .
also electrical problem started happening and the lights kept turning on and off .
also , the room had a few bugs that were found within the bathroom .
not good .
dude , get over yourself .
not a good experience staying here .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i mean , they get paid to do that !
life is too short .
hey , we can get these free smells at almost any walmart .
cheap prices and everything you could ever want to purchase all in one place !
i have been in other locations that are cleaner and run more efficiently .
my cart does n't roll straight .
i 'm not surprised .
fifty cent clearance plastic margarita glasses .
patrons leave their carts at the bus stop .
the problem is the store .
i came here one night just for some shampoo and conditioner .
i have shopped here on many occasions .
disgusting !
i mean , i get it , it 's walmart .
horribly run store .
i drive the extra _num_ miles to go to a different one .
the real problem came when she needed to get her supervisor for approval .
just no .
no apologies .
just walked away .
never again will i step foot in that store .
horrible service !
seriously sketchy .
there are never any open registers .
the produce is disgusting .
terrible , slow customer service .
grapes .
and every day , there is a force of security guards on duty .
this walmart is ridiculous .
how can you only staff _num_ cashier on a sunday afternoon .
nasty lady .
worst walmart in town .
poorly managed .
so annoyed .
no apology .
this place however has earned it .
worst wal-mart in arizona .
for supplies and repairs we pay a few hundred every month .
employee was not !
how rude !
this was my first visit here .
i also had a gel manicure and paid extra for the hand massage .
i stopped by because my regular salon was booked .
my french mani looks like i did it at home and it 's peeling .
$ _num_ for a pedicure ?
she was not friendly .
she was so rude !
-- -- -- they never run through your file !
and they will send it to me before _num_ .
i still respect heather sending them to me so late after their business hours .
i 've usually had good experiences here , _num_ % of the time .
last time they fell on their face for me .
insisted that this model could be oriented any of the four directions .
would not recommend them for anything !
never missed a payment .
also , they have started charging all kinds of hidden fees .
do you really want these guys taking your money for using it ?
nobody fucking cares !
!
i walked in there at 11am , out at 3pm .
i said no again .
unbelievable .
normal waiting time later we went back to a room again and waited more .
my complaint is with the strange wait times .
only they sell new furniture instead of used cars .
my husband and i went in here last week to look at beds .
Positive
walked in the door and we were n't greeted at all .
most of the stuff is cheap .
very painful !
worth it considering low prices they give you on furniture .
incompetent and unprofessional .
i went over to pick up the car and decide what to do .
he just try to bs his way around without answering .
she was very helpful and we settled on a nice design and product .
i was sadly mistaken .
it does not work again .
i am annoyed and irritated .
that 's the reason why i am writing this review .
big mistake .
dead wrong .
total quote : $ _num_ .
just had a pair of jeans hemmed here .
will not be back .
no big deal .
it was only _num_ am .
this is not the place .
i showed her my receipt and she showed me hers .
she wrote over the _num_ with a _num_ !
bad business !
he showed me personally all the things this location messed up .
my coworker and i stopped there got lunch yesterday .
ugh .
but it is n't .
Neutral
they even charge an entrance fee .
not my type of place i admit .
very unappealing .
my wife 's food was cold .
i asked for cheese ravioli with non meat sauce .
vegetarian check your plates .
i wish there were - starts .
this place is the rudest place i 've been .
( there were open tables all over the restaurant ) .
( really ppl , it 's arizona ) .
danny 's was a _num_ star car wash _num_ years ago !
the outside looked better , but not better enough to account for $ _num_ .
has n't been for _num_ years .
was confusing .
for the last several years , i have regularly attended this location .
besides that , it was so hot and stuffy in there .
rude staff .
leave me alone and just let me work out .
total waste of time .
glad i did my homework .
now my truck warranty is over and i am done .
the salesman i was handed off to , was great .
i rated this dealership _num_ stars when i purchased my car .
the problem was never fixed !
the representative said the car will be ready by the time i get there .
i scheduled an oil change and tire rotation .
im not done here.
Neutral
initial scan for engine trouble codes and written estimate for repairs '' .
they hand wrote the _num_ codes on a sticky pad .
that was n't the problem .
as in did n't bite .
i was seconds away from walking out .
i heard people talk about this place at work a lot .
it is not .
this is shady horrific .
they cater to the regulars over _num_ .
not my choice in spending a friday night .
waste of my time !
it was disgusting .
what good is a breakfast shop that is out of food before breakfast .
on one visit , they gave me my food but forgot my drink .
no one was there .
gross !
i 'm happy with my new gym '' is n't getting through !
completely frustrating .
horrible experience !
in total they have stolen $ _num_ from me and my family .
what a disappointment !
there are other clubs that are way better to accommodate you without the hustle .
ugh go away !
annoying .
makes me a little nervous about auto pay .
the sales people here seem like they are right off the car lot !
just cancelled my membership .
i have little ones who take swim lessons .
a mistake , no doubt .
yes _num_ percent discount !
avoid at all costs .
awful , awful , awful !
she has someone else paint them without doing anything else .
ugly !
terrible service !
so disappointed !
_num_ days from today .
_num_ bus .
not here .
they are ridiculously slow .
i 've been to this subway almost every week for three years .
predictable .
very typical subway .
they really are dumb .
service is now painfully slow .
it again comes down to being too much effort .
the tuna did n't taste fresh .
i am not even sure .
however , the vegetables were fresh and tender and the potato slices tender .
the first course is a trio of pastas , each with their own sauce .
it did seem clean , i 'll give them that .
i would not recommend this salon .
if you are not expecting a lot you might like it better .
big mistake .
its not exactly for the younger ( under _num_ ) crowd .
at that point , i just wanted to leave .
`` just for me '' my foot .
i just wish to share with the yelp community how i was treated .
stopped here on a road trip from phoenix to tucson .
: ( so disappointed .
looks like we 'll be sticking with pizza hut .
was told _num_ to _num_ min .
cold .
undercooked pizza crust is unpleasant .
has been much better but is much further away from us .
horrible !
!
absolutely horrible experience .
i always use them when i play jazz . ''
their pro audio section is the least pro i 've seen .
poor mic selection too .
why you may ask ?
but $ _num_ ?
there were dozens , all in the $ _num_ price range .
every used guitar there is at best $ _num_ cheaper than the new model .
_num_ years of theft is long enough !
it was sad .
but i can tell you that the parent operation is questionable .
crappy customer service !
no greeting , no help .
passed 4-5 employees , nothing .
same thing goes for a lot of other gear .
horrible safeway !
this store never has enough cashiers .
fail .
my first trip here in a while was breakfast time .
but not this place .
so disgusting .
the meat didnt taste like meat .
it was weird .
service was horrible .
she was rude and inconsiderate .
our experience with this store has not been positive .
are you kidding me ?
the tech took me to a waiting room .
because `` meh , i 've experienced better '' is exactly what i think .
not , a-ok .
and do n't expect your report to get to your doctor before your appointment .
just no .
the nails look terrible .
cheap ?
anywho , we come in and request for helen .
overall , this place is a hit or miss for me .
am i willing to return to take that risk again ?
also not to mention this was all done on a holiday .
so after being a loyal customer my time has come with this place .
i was recently in a car accident on a hot _num_ degree day .
very disappointed .
no bueno .
my big problem ?
not the same , not great .
we should know better than to go in one .
training , training , training .
we were n't happy .
thus , the _num_ stars .
my family and i went there , all six of us .
it was terrible .
not so .
no complaints .
the salad and soup were just okay .
it is not chicken , i swear to you .
a manager came up immediately said told the waitress to leave our table .
everyone in the room was staring , shaking their heads .
witnessed one gentleman send his plate back .
i have got to remember to stop going there .
i need this handled before 8pm .
bad business .
i 'm really bummed , yelpers .
it 's horrible . ''
no fair .
we selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill .
i chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite .
it just is n't great .
we stopped coming in awhile ago just because of the prices .
vegetarians fyi , there is seafood stock in the yc 's own sauce .
i used to love yc 's and went frequently .
i went yesterday and first of all was totally put off by the price !
beyond inappropriate and dangerous !
_num_ ) it 's close to my house .
i loaded my bowl up with steak and chicken with a lot of veggies .
waste of money .
you can not stack the food higher than a certain point .
that is why there are two sizes .
excuse me ?
your solution is that i should pay for the bowls in the beginning ?
you are not a buffet .
it 's insulting .
the ambiance is very ordinary and they could definitely do better job with it .
they didnt ask me for a spice level when they took my order .
the food is alright nothing out of the ordinary .
that was annoying .
horrible .
uh , no .
but the food was just ok.
it 's not very good .
nope , not anymore !
that 's half the reason why this place rocks !
what the hell dude ?
worst location !
terrible customer service .
soooo slow !
the person at the counter says , `` $ _num_ '' .
the soda , diet ( which i think tastes like feet ) .
ick .
for that , i am appreciative .
it was terrible .
change ur dang grease !
disgusting !
no smiles anywhere .
gross .
my lip wax was also not executed correctly .
worst service ever .
when you first walk in it looks a little nicer then most salons .
will not be back !
quality nails is not .
the techs rushed thru my pedi and fill .
she acts like doing my nails is a big pain in her ass .
yet she treats me like scum .
i will be calling later today to make a formal complaint to lisa .
not quality nails !
very poor service .
they looked horrible !
i could n't believe it !
absolute worst gel manicure !
big mistake !
does she actually think i have not had my nails done for years ?
they sent me a coupon with an add for an $ _num_ pedi .
i will not be returning ... .
ridiculous .
i 've gone here off and on over the last couple of years .
i will not be back .
avoid this place !
he trusted me , and ordered anyway .
we just ordered pizza and chicken wings from rosati 's , tempe .
our order was for pepperoni , pepperoni and olive , and their white pizza .
i do n't like this .
this is ridiculous .
i keep trying this place cuz the pizza is decent .
wrong .
they just raised their already high prices even higher .
nope ... never again .
could have spent half as much .
over two hours and $ _num_ + dollars later ?
wow is this not america where you have to honor the advertisement ?
terrible service .
they eventually settled on me paying the price difference for the right one .
food edible .
worst customer service ever !
it 's a very generic americanized version of italian food .
it tastes very similar to the macaroni grill .
my date had the veal marsala which was a stretch to call pedestrian .
wrong .
avoid this place .
this place was horrible !
your sign out front said _num_ % off between 4pm and 6pm .
still no consideration .
sauce was n't spectacular though .
ridiculous .
hubby and i ate here in march on a saturday night .
having said that , i had a seafood ravioli .
i ca n't remember what hubby ate .
we did n't get bread refilled .
the rosemary olive oil was nice though .
Positive
the negatives were in fact all of the food .
my veal piccata was an oily salt lick .
Negative
i know why , the other one is much better .
both were lacking salt .
it was so disappointing !
it just tasted like nothing .
however , it seems like there is much room for improvement in the management .
if we take both we will loose money .
this place is so strange .
food was bland .
waters came with black things floating around in them .
so i will never be back .
he rushed us to table , and out of restaurant .
if you want good italian food , keep searching .
if you want a good laugh , try to get the waiter i got .
terrible .
basically breaded sole on top of linguini with mussels and clams .
my sister ordered the sausage and pepper risotto .
she chose the osso bucco which came with risotto .
no way .
unfortunately my meal was horrible .
terrible customer service !
disappointing .
horrible customer service !
so so rude !
i dunno .
stupid .
you ca n't beat $ _num_ drinks ( which were awesome .
they had your basic bar menu ; burgers , wings , and salads .
they have karaoke during the evenings most every night .
they were _num_ inches too short .
it 's an arby 's , food tastes like every other arby 's .
what the crap ?
however she set me up to come back for some blood work .
i went in for a physical in may , he gave me two refills .
i am _num_ years old .
unnecessary .
i 'm going to find another doctor .
get ready to be treated like a transaction rather than a patient .
return to the basics and make a difference would be my advice to them .
thank you for your prompt response .
we 'll start at the beginning .
i 'm not talking complicated stuff here either .
worst office ever !
someone i had recommend them to just told me he is dropping them .
it is quicker to go to a lab to get your blood taken .
i have had _num_ female doctors that i have seen at the practice leave .
they push , push , push , unnecessary tests and medications .
upsell , upsell , upsell at this place .
not cool , guys !
rude .
horrible people .
do not recommend at all .
she was awful !
i wish doc mike had better help .
for the record doc mike is great , they just need better management .
also ran blood tests not related to me at all .
went in on a monday , and the doctor wrote me a prescription .
do not use this place .
do not go here , go somewhere else .
i asked for part of them exam to include a breast exam .
i finished the medication but was very ill still .
i went a mile down the road to an urgent care .
the medication i take can only be written for _num_ month at a time .
she said she could write him a prescription for antibiotics if he wants .
i 'm sure three times the normal price .
my fat cat gets better care than that !
avoid !
horrible office !
really makes me feel cared about .
inexperienced rude staff .
they just called me again today about my appointment in october .
not going back .
she looked annoyed .
clean when your customers are gone please ... my final star off for that .
not happy and wont return .
however i am unsure about the customer service .
i was definitely put off by that .
after a few weeks i did , this time i want a pedicure spa .
totally disappointed !
i am never going back !
i called _num_ places .
he did get me my purse when he said , so he was timely .
guess he has enough business to not worry about good customer service .
according to other reviews , this is nothing new .
what a messy place !
not worth my time .
the sushi was not good .
the sushi was well , shall i say good but warm ?
the wait staff was very friendly .
not a great way to start my all-you-can-eat experience .
we opted for soda , and we paid for soda .
very slow service !
probably my first & last time here .
my experience was underwhelming .
r they going out of business ?
overall very disappointed .
real mexican food would beat up taco bell food if they crossed paths .
sorry taco bell .
they have messed up my order _num_ times in a row .
from now on , i 'm only getting veggie stuff there .
used the drive through for my son tonight .
garlic bread was cold !
horrible .
nothing special .
ordered half off apps menu .
considering how over staffed they were you think the tables might be cleaned off .
slow as hell .
no big deal .
drinks ordered and arrived quickly .
got the thai shrimp salad ( sub shrimp for chicken . )
red robin has the same tasting hamburgers but charges less .
this restaurant charges $ _num_ just to swap out french fries for onion rings .
no manager in sight .
awful customer customer .
unbelievable .
i kept finding granite but everyone i found was sold .
horrible .
i walked in just as they were closing after driving an hour there .
i walked in and headed right where i needed to be .
the scottsdale showroom has better customer service as far as the tile showroom goes .
do not buy from this store .
avoid avoid avoid .
and no japanese curry ?
the chicken is dry when i order white meat .
i got a chicken teriyaki bowl with white chicken .
thumbs down .
this place is not good .
the food is too expensive .
tips jars for what exactly ?
beef egg rolls ?
not again .
so we took it , not everything fit !
so , we drove on and got to our hotel in az .
when we left 1/2 hour later , the a/c was out again !
i was very sick .
wrong !
i hate that .
ah , well , why ?
stand in line every where and three hours go by much faster .
anyways , thats beside the point .
i took my dad here to kill a sunday afternoon in may .
they really could improve their on-site service .
i have to give the workers kudos for working hard that day .
and i guess that 's all there needs to be , eh ?
i do n't remember the bathrooms .
worse place ever !
seems unsafe and dirty .
this place closed permanently in dec _num_ .
probably for the best , it had seen better days .
not worth the bother .
nothing special .
i think there are more better burgers and fish and chips out there .
this is just gross !
the food is the big problem at this location .
i did n't finish my food .
it seemed like we had to ask for everything here .
i will not be coming back .
salad was terrible .
very slow !
i know what you 're thinking : did you send it back ?
want another example of where you can get better burgers ?
ordered appetizers and dinner , appetizers came out with the dinner and not before .
plates were chipped on corners .
felt very bland .
red robin , you 're breaking my heart .
we were seated and things were busy , but not packed .
it should not be called a hospital .
the vet techs care , but the doctors do n't listen to them .
everything she said was like she was reading a text book .
terrible service .
they are sleazy and unreliable .
i purchased a used vehicle from this dealer in march of _num_ .
so - thanks hyundai tempe for being so deceiving .
Negative
it seems like this is a trend with these guys .
it is bad !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
do not buy from this dealership .
do not buy from this dealership .
no kidding .
we really regret buying from them .
terrible customer service .
will not go back .
horrible customer service .
i walked out and left .
i will try to make this short .
customer service went downhill .
i made sure to check what time they closed ( 6pm ) .
i showed up around 5pm , and stood around in the service lane .
wish i could tell you .
never never again .
we walked all over their lot first before checking out the other dealerships .
low pressure and she answered all our questions .
my wife had problems one night with her car when the office was closed .
disappointing !
we wait and wait and wait .
she was busy in chatting to co-worker and doing whatever on her phone .
this comment stated for me to call the gm ?
i 'm also not a new customer to the hyundai motor company .
no problems there .
i also explained i have my own coolant at home .
he finally backed off and agreed to let me just get my oil changed .
yes , i knew this , they are minor leaks .
the car is _num_ years old .
no more .
unbelievable .
i was greeted politely and my truck was shortly pulled into the bay .
very disappointing !
are they insane ?
people are not buying drinks and just getting water which costs them money .
the medium was too large .
afraid of a _num_ lb , claw less , half shaved cat .
is n't that their jobs ?
they also look miserable .
he had never done this before .
again the next night , but less so .
i understand that you ca n't prevent everything and dogs can move quickly .
and noticed blood running down my dog 's neck .
are n't there cameras ?
horrible organization .
he could n't care less .
so i am stunned this place has five star reviews .
hubby ordered some beer and i drank a `` berry '' lemonade .
she comes back out the kitchen and says they are making it now .
i said why not .
this place is horrible .
Negative
the atmosphere was naturally very loud .
$ _num_ , she said .
seems a little high for a 5:30 time slot .
when i requested my ( 2nd ) check , i was charged for _num_ .
very dry .
tried _num_ different flavors , the jalapeno one was by far the most tolerable .
their service is terrible .
this place is nasty .
someone in that kitchen is n't cooking food right .
no thank you .
i stopped eating here before and this is confirmation of my decision .
_num_ of the `` boneless `` wings were all breading .
this is not a gourmet dinning .
wings were not good as well .
in a word disappointing .
overpriced and slow .
so disappointed .
he had just had major foot surgery and needed to eat before taking medication .
when we walked in , we were greeted fairly quickly by the hostess .
we will never return again .
terrible service .
no sorry or anything .
tonight i opted for something different - the buffalo chicken ranch sandwich .
not the service or the food .
i apologized to server but explained the issue and asked for a new one .
hmm i know there was more to this salad .
i recall reading carrots and various cheeses .
nachos were cold .
worse service ever !
went back after the owner replied to my review .
this place sucked .
we got the chocolate cake and cheesecake bites for desert .
i hated this place .
it was terrible .
very busy .
food was mediocre !
no biggie .
why _num_ star ?
ugh .
decided to walk outside and call because reservations at a sports bar is questionable .
i ordered wings , ate and was fine .
he does n't live up to the name !
kind of hard to get if you never stop by to check on us .
busy friday night at bww so i walk in with two of my friends .
it was _num_ seconds max .
incredibly rude .
the food is standard bar quality fare and the wings and burgers are meh .
i put down a $ _num_ .
so i decided to run my car down to sun devil auto .
which was about $ _num_ over my budget .
i will probably only bring my car for an oil change in the future .
i had to get silverware and place mat from another table .
she met minimum standards of professionalism and friendliness .
ceiling tiles were water stained .
eggs were cold , coffee was luke warm .
service was very poor .

my dog died after a routine dental cleaning at warner vista animal hospital .
( she could n't even walk !
i took my buddy down there for an early morning tee time .
now , i understand taking _num_ carts may have been a little much .
will not be back .
so i can not judge it .
eh , i was hungry , nothing else was open at 3am .
i always find what i need but the customer service could be better .
it is hard to find anyone to help out with questions .
i cant wait to go back and try different menu items .
i ordered the bbq chicken pizza and my husband ordered the just enough wings .
are you kidding me ?
had to go back inside and wait for them to make it correctly .
$ _num_ for this ?
complete ripoff .
avoid !
not helpful at all .
attitude , attitude , attitude .
how long had it been sitting there anyways ?
it was ridiculous .
and it 's not hard to see why .
so make sure you scan your regal loyalty card for extra points .
to charge .
thats crazy assigned seats !
better .
impact of movie .
sucked !
ladies bathroom was disgusting .
very disappointed .
very confusing for the elderly people in front of us .

no credit .
no refund .
i 'm skipping regal in the future .
long lines at the concession stand .
it 's very difficult with a tub .
bad customer service .
the process took way to long though .
just to upgrade and get set up took hours !
in there this morning at _num_ am .
skip this course .
greens are rough as well .
_num_ ; _num_ tee time .
each time he managed to find a problem and extra treatment that was needed .
any other day i 'd say val vista dental was your average dentist .
they 're are also very accommodating and responsive .
the dental assistants are the best thing val vista dental has going for them .
go to lowes on way home from dog park .
richard asks cashier to give him balance on gift card .
manager takes me to back of garden center and points to weed fabric .
go home ... water down dogs and wife .
i tell him i 'm trying to reach garden .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
so think twice before you goto lowes .
i am a mile down the street from this location .
there is nothing you will find here that is of any quality .
it 's got nothing here .
avoid .
_num_ ' x _num_ '' , _num_ x _num_ '' ?
want your customers to come back ?
overall , i would recommend not shopping here .
the towel used to place my feet on was basically see through .
this place is awful !
burger king sucks .
man was i wrong !
horrible horrible store !
not impressed .
bland food .
disappointed .
we ordered , lo mein , mongolian beef , and sesame chicken .
the food was horrible .

sigh '' and her friends just walk through the kitchen as they please .
that ca n't be sanitary .
she could not have cared less .
peter , the owner called .
called for delivery and ordered crab puffs and egg rolls for appetizers .
asked for extra sweet and sour to which we got none at all .
chicken egg foo young comes in a box ?
eventually , someone gets it closed .
very disappointing .
beware of big o tires !
german stated that my ticket was hanging and was next .
the job was completed a week ago and i am satisfied with the outcome .
this place breaks your car so you have to go back to them !
avoid at all costs !
so i drove my truck to the dealership leaving a trail of smoke .
i think their overall rating speaks for itself .
had to stop at another place and get tire balanced .
useless .
big o mistake !
we were quite disappointed .
not good !
this is not safe .
so i guess there is that .
i decide to give them another shot and get my oil changed .
do not go to this one .
you lost another customer .
terrible service .
price was now $ _num_ .
should be done in _num_ mins .
they book everyone every _num_ mins .
not run well at all !
they book everyone every _num_ mins .
not run well at all !
the food there is average .
i will be avoiding this location from now on .
they fill like you are trying to get a free meal out of them .
i 've tried this location _num_ times since it is convenient to my house .
this location is _num_ for _num_ .
terrible .
need another hour .
oh , but he gave me estimates for getting the work done .
a far cry from what i 've experienced in the past .
i 'm sure that will work out for you in the long run .
i drop it off they say it will be ready at 6pm .
i left after an hour with nothing .
i will be going to an urgent care tonight .
this last time , my small child was having some work done .
not patient care , and not acting professionally .
highly inappropriate .
none of the workers care .
i talked to a manager named madison .
terrible experience !
not going back again .
sitting in the drive thru long enough to write a review .
i only charge you $ _num_ . ''
and i 'm sure other people will think twice after reading this review .
avoid them like the plague .
i then drove to another venue where they had even heard about this before .
horrible experience !
again , awkward .
overall , very unpleasant .
even though i had met and talked with him before .
i was pressured by him to go with him as my dj .
that is dishonest .
i 'm sure they get paid for the services they provide .
the plates were hot and the rice and beans were pretty tasty .
this is mexican food like your white momma used to make .
i could n't eat it !
nothing we ate had any flavor or tasted fresh at all .
avoid avoid avoid .
my hubs and i really wanted to try this place out .
i 've been here a few times .
it is decorated like a mexican restaurant .
prices were higher than other mom and pop places .
just like the tacos , i judge a place on the beans .
i really wish it had been better .
lindsay pharmacy is horrible !
if anyone knows about hospitals and dr. 's offices , it 's me .
we 'll see how the appointment goes next week .
they book everyone every _num_ mins .
not run well at all !
absolutely horrible service .
not worth it .
i have eaten a few and have not been impressed .
this is tex-mex cafeteria food .
( that reminds me , i am going to yelp qt next .
so here is why chipotle gets two stars .
i am not proud .
when the black beans are cooked all the way through , it is awesome .
this location is a hit or miss , usually a miss .
sometimes the beans are crunchy , sometimes the rice is crunchy or under seasoned .
i have never seen so much turn over in an establishment .
the employees here are unbelievable .
now it 's time to go through the salsa , sour cream , etc .
section as you make your way to the cash register .
my husband said , salsa , corn and light sour cream .
they did n't rush you .
i love chipotle .
last time i was here i wanted guacamole in my bowl .
half the line behind me walked out .
now , only friendly staffs .
are you lost ?
terrible .
terrible .
terrible .
good thing the is a frys near by to get some decent bottles sauce .
i had the general chicken and my wife ate the beef & broccoli .
this place gets _num_ stars because the staff was all very attentive and friendly .
i will give them _num_ start for friendly customer service .
fail !
they are off of our dining list .
horrible manager !
beyond that , i have not been impressed with the food .
this place is a big dive bar with not much to brag about .
gyro was made with a frozen patty heated on a grill .
save you time money and appetite and find a different place to eat .
come by , but sit away from the bar after 2:00 .
for a long time and ca n't say enough good things about it .
but not this one .
too expensive for what you get .
completely flat soda .
ahh ... i should learn .
she was not friendly at all .
we like going here for the atmosphere , beer and tvs .
the food is just ok .
we were rather disappointed .
not a very good lunch at all .
worst place ever !
the server told us to f @ * ?
terrible service .
we received our pizza and low and behold there was cheese on both sides .
it serve probably _num_ people if they all had _num_ pizza each .
not worth the savings .
tonight my son ordered a vegan pizza , yet it was brought with cheese .
but tonight was not that case .
no thanks !
fast oil change , _num_ stars .
are you kidding me ?
was just there trying to get my _num_ vehicle serviced for an oil change .
i would steer clear of this business .
i do not recommend .
not much else to it .
the pizza is just ok .
i had a buffet and the salad is all mixed together with the dressing .
i could not believe it !
a customer proceeds to checkout an entire shopping cart at the pharmacy counter .
this is while other customers including me wait to pick up prescriptions .
this target however , is a freaking let down .
i hate that .
but no .
not here .
no more .
unless its an emergency .
the manager is incompetent .
most classes get out early - sometimes two hours !
could n't get to _num_ percent .
horrible place !
their service is horrible .
i wo n't be back.
_num_ for a large drink and _num_ for a large fry .
lady told me she would be with me in a minute .
lazy .
i just left .
sushi is more than _num_ % of your menu !
very disappointed .
i ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl .
do n't buy the sushi here .
_num_ pieces each - for _num_ ?
the flavor is bland .
literally _num_ dollars for _num_ pieces of sushi ?
had to drive through mcdonald 's to satisfy our stomach .
the chicken and teriyaki flavor was way off .
i 'm not stupid .
zero stars !
people really should read up on body language .
i would not recommend this groomer .
horrible !
i 'm sure there 's other groomers that would appreciate my business .
i use to really liked this pet groomer .
even my friends asked if he is alright , because he was acting differently .
took my truck to get brake fluid flush and rear brakes adjusted .
i 've got ta agree with jesse on the only other review .
worst .
the gym will be closed in june _num_ .
that 's why i go to lowes .
i am totally shocked that this is how home depot handles the door dept .
_num_ people waiting for paint .
she is loud enough for everyone to hear and not kind at all .
same _num_ employees working .
stood there again for _num_ min .
but , i would recommend going to the foot solutions on n. scottsdale .
but i will not go back .
the towels used were dingy and had holes in them .
i have been to this establishment twice now on a friday .
i have been here before , its a bar !
we ordered our drinks and the place wasnt overly full at 9pm .
i went there tonight to hear live music .
shame .
i went in tonight for a beer and to take some food home .
ca n't trust it .
gross !
i dunno .
oh how i wish i had taken pictures to post along with this .
nasty !
nasty !
nasty !
i can not stress that enough .
i explained we didnt have bottled waters .
bad experience !
slow service !
she just ignored me .
i would not recommend this place .

not the newest or greatest or cheapest .
went on a friday at noon .
dirty , bad area .
so ridiculous !
horrible experience .
very disappointed .
they blew me off .
so sad !
it is not posted on the main page of the website .
_num_ stars simply for the nostalgia and my kids have a blast .
gross !
overpriced and disgusting food .
before renting an apartment here , please check it out for yourself .
i would advise anyone to choose any other school besides this one .
that is ridiculous .
they also built a full public safety building in tempe .
time to hire a new guy in financial planning .
i am so glad this will be my final year .
terrible staff .
but not great either .
only went cause friends invited .
it 's just not very good .
the caesar salad was abysmal .
it may be awhile before i am willing to give you another chance .
we ordered salads , soups , a sandwich and a chicken breast meal .
however , we had to wait an extremely long time to get our food .
horrible experience .
horrible hostess .
horrible horrible experience !
service was so slow .
the waiter had to flagged down to get refills ever dissapointed in the service .
stopped in on the way from home to the airport .
three staff were standing at the entrance .
we were given menus promptly and greeted by our waitress .
halfway thru the burger the server returns asking if we wanted anything else .
the chicken tortilla soup should be called tortilla soup .
everything else was obviously made from frozen .
had spinach artichoke dip and macaroni and cheese .
my chicken wings were cold .
the service is terrible .
your service is awful .
did not suit my needs .
hands down never coming back !
also the potatoes were cold .
the service was terrible .
i do n't normally review anything _num_ star ... .
but i ordered the bourbon chicken and shrimp .
terrible .
no buffalo stuff anywhere .
not normally my go to pizza place because i often forget about it .
major disappointment .
service is not their strong suit .
food was not very good tonight .
zero customer service skills .
i 'm sorry .
but this is n't new york .
it was a little dry .
i need to stop drinking and eating here .
this just shows me the manager was in a hurry .
the quality of service desperately needs attention !
strawberries banana pancake .
no bananas .
all bad .
the cooks need to learn the proper food prep order so everything is hot .
granted its ihop but my expectations are higher than what was met .
so me and some friend went to this i hop today .
very frustrating .
not in a rush to visit again .
however , i decided to give ihop one more try .
friendly but inexperienced waitress .
order was cold mess .
they certainly were not real .
the manager gave us a _num_ % off coupon for next time .
the cleanliness of ihop is always not so great .
it never fills me up and it always gives me stomach issues .
chorizo burrito added bacon and potatoes .
there low prices for sure .
they try too make there food like them anyways !
from a glance at their menu they are overpriced on just about everything .
i ordered two al pastor tacos and one of asada .
the place was gross .
not sanitary .
my boyfriend was very hungry .
very very disappointing !
very poor quality chicken .
this was the first and last time i do a transaction online with sonic .
bad service .
dishonest .
very annoying .
he the went on to ask me what experience i have working with children .
wish i had not gone .
out of ten nail not s signal one matches .
did not offer to fix the problem .
not worth the $ _num_ i paid .
they really need to switch it out for some good , warm italian bread .
hopefully you 'll have a better experience there if you try it out .
the food then was to die .
when i found out that the place had been sold , i understood completely .
but consider yourself warned .
both times each dish was dry .
i would recommend this but not the food .
bad experience !
this place is not good .
yelpers really let me down on this one !
then the main dishes ?
another _num_ mins ?
too close for comfort at the lanes when bowling next to another family .
prices seem a bit high , sales person was snooty .
no .
terrible .
Neutral
worst clinic ever !
staff really acts like is they know everything .
i left there upset but still went back for my follow up appointment .
so ridiculous !
worst walgreens ever !
please avoid this location .
they will fail you .
horrible !
so far , _num_ weeks in and i 'm doing great .
nasty breakfast food .
( supreme croissant ) .
go the nearby mcdonalds instead .
very disgusting .
i will not go back .
but let 's get down to business .
the bar was terrible .
all the staff was very polite and courteous , except for one bouncer .
this to me is never a good sign .
i hate that .
but no rice ) .
i will not be going back .
do n't believe me ?
just kill the chips on your shoulders .
i dropped my laundry off for the wash and fold service .
he was horrible .
something is wrong .
unfortunately , i was wrong .
this place is horrible .
they are a nightmare !
nope , sorry .
it was crispy , not overly sweet or spicey .
until about _num_ hours later .
then it became painful .
very mediocre chinese food .
the low mein was just that ... noodles .
bland .
boring .
bad chinese food !
so , i 'm sure you 're wanting to hear about the restaurant .
ugh , annoying .
if not , well ... you get the picture .
i came here with my wife and daughter for some dinner .
the service was lackluster .
drinks ran low a few times and we had to ask for refills .
the chili relleno wrapped in an omelet was ... .
these are terrible ! ''
there is a guy that walks around and fills chips only .
but ca n't he refill drinks too ?
drinks ordered and they brought out chips and salsa quickly .
it was n't too substantial .
this is their version of the chicken chimichanga with jalapeo cream cheese .
the food was annoying .
nothing stood out .
not the jalapeo cream cheese , the beans , the rice , nada .
ah , manuel 's , what has happened to you ?
he walked away as we were ordering .
food was disgusting .
so i walked out .
such rude and careless service .
unbelievable .
the pizza was _num_ min .
the crust was so thin you need your reading glasses to see it .
the sauce taste like salsa filler .
honestly the prices are too high .
customer service still horrible .
someone needs to teach the workers how to resolve customer complaints .
worst flower experience .
i ordered online to have a mixed bouquet delivered on mother 's day .
ruined the whole surprise .
o.k .
i am looking forward to meeting them in person .
have to say disappointed .
they are really terrible .
ridiculous !
they need to stop !
well it was n't .
no good .
Negative
would n't recommend this bar .
she wears glasses , has dark hair and is pale .
however , some of the staff members have a serious attitude problem .
ummm , you like sticky bar top ?
nasty ass place !
maricopa county health dept .
needs to shut that bitch down for real !
the date of my visit was saturday , august 8th .
not impressed .
the first time the staff was helpful , however today was the complete opposite !
i 'm never going back .
horrible service !
you feel rushed the whole time .
last time i checked , customers at any business makes the paycheck .
they refuse to honor subway coupons .
Negative
terrible service .
horrible food .
awful , snotty service .
no matter ... .
the absolute rudest staff possible .
hamburger was cold .
never had a pizza messed up anywhere before last night .
the staff was rude .
not friendly at all .
would strongly recommend looking for another doctor .
the doctor is fine but all of the supporting staff is totally substandard !
that 's right , _num_ new or _num_ used .
bad idea .
but we wont be back .
changed my mind after the last interaction .
it takes away the financial stress .
spent $ _num_ .
but no way .
totally underwhelming mexican food .
is it terrible ?
it was a serious problem !
it was really bad .
i 've had two big problems with this place .
second problem came when i took my mom there for lunch .
it is just an ok place to eat .
the food is total generic mexican food .
very very sad .
the chip and salsa lady made more visits the waiter .
very disgusting .
but i ca n't risk this happening any longer .
they were ignorant and racist .
should be more careful who they say these things around .
i wouldnt go there if the services were free .
this place did n't do that .
not a professional business at all .
typical shady auto repair place , staffed by under experienced techs .
to the point that i 'm willing to give them another shot .
oh and their prices are n't quite impressive .
moreover , i would wait over an hour ( sometimes _num_ hrs ! )
a hundred dollars more than the part costs retail ?
what a darn shame !
the management is awful !
the waiting room chairs are not plus size friendly at all .
it was nuts and that is unheard of .
my advise to you : find a better caring professional doctor !

i want to get it all -- cut , color , highlights .
she can tint it for me for an extra $ _num_ !
`` just go home , wash your face , put some makeup over it .
based on the reviews , i thought i would try this place out .
that was a mistake .
treated dogs like little babies .
they mentioned it as is it were a courtesy .
that really bothered me .
they are too expensive .
horrible !
someone had confirmed my appointment for my .
i have been a client with my kids for _num_ years .
this appt has been scheduled for six months .
not very good customer service .
he is good with her and very attentive during appointments , never feel rushed .
unfortunate .
i had an emergency with my son that required him to see a specialist .
i 'm pretty sure they never clean the waiting room .
( probably so he could get lunch ) .
horrible !
my review is only of the billing practices and billing staff at this office .
this place is horrible .
we were of course approved and the rent was raised by $ _num_ .
once contract signed , service ends .
i mean really , it 's january and _num_ degrees outside .
only complete morons would let business walk out the door .
i made all payments on time as requested .
waiting is how most of the time is spent at this location .
just let that image sink in a little bit .
ok , so i finally decide to take advantage of my insurance .

prices are high , staff was nice .
the staff was not welcoming .
buy one get one free and buy something and get chips and salsa free .
will be last time i come here , i would steer clear !
very long wait even if you do the online appt thing .
really doctor , nothing you can do ?
they never responded to my email .
big deal out of ordering first .
they did n't get anyone through .
they failed that chance .
not the greatest both greatest .
i said the house special chicken meal and she ordered the orange chicken meal .
it is just ok .
ugh .
a knife might have been a nice to have , but none was offered .
i would probably go back in winter for my next visit .
ok so this was my first time going here .
- this is more like a sweet soy sauce chicken .
the only decent thing we got were egg rolls .
wo n't be back .
she was extremely rude .
not good .
this place sucked .
i 'm not eating there again !
wish there was a good alternative nearby .
every time i come here , my order gets messed up .
the store is too small .
it is not big enough to accommodate their customers .
normally they 're super busy , which i totally understand and am use to .
because she wanted to be sure they were made correctly , i 'm sure .
i used to live by this einstein 's and would visit it regularly .

in the meantime , i was browsing through the gel polish color options .
Negative
_num_ at the most .
literally i could go on for an hour .
im closing my account and going to wells fargo .
nothing helped .
real bad .

oh and lets not forget the wonderful breakfast .
next time maybe i will try john c lincoln .
my estimate was thursday to monday some time .
worst doctor ever !
pathetic !

f the yelp reviews .
after she found out what i wanted , they werent serving it .
i called them back at _num_ a.m. and was put on hold .
this was our first visit to this place .
i 've never owned a dog before .
is anyone with me on this ?
even if it 's obvious i 'm upset over something .
the surgeon spoke to me over the phone , telling me my options .
they are more concerned with your money than the safety of your animal .
you are disgusting .
he could have died .
i wish i did more research before i took him here .
but i did n't get that .
it was very plain .
granted they made it fresh , but i suspect they used cheap ingredients .
she said _num_ minutes .
the taste however was n't special .
i personally like my pepperoni to be slightly crunchy .
this pepperoni was not .

i refused .
horrible experience .
horrible customer service .
but this had never happens before .
there 's an urgent care there now .
the apartment structure is very very cheap , not inexpensive , cheap !
strongly not recommended .

i 'm just thankful there 's other burger places .
so , so bad .
it was terrible though .
rude .
way to fast !
frys horrible !
ok this is getting old .

does anyone over their age of _num_ work or manage there .
please reset the times that the fries sit out .
toss them out once they are warm .
only fresh hot fries should be served to patrons .
Positive
i waited on thursday , friday , saturday , monday and finally called them .
bad business ethic .
i went in for an oil change thinking this would be quick and easy .
i went out side to see where it went and it was parked outside .
they can not service it .
awful awful awful .
this is where the walmart comes in .
you ca n't be better than me if you work at the walmart .
worst walmart ever !
horrible never returning .
the furniture manager is a fool .
they also do window tint .
quoted price was $ _num_ .
horrible customer service .
at best buy arrowhead , they can really take or leave you it seems .
i am a college kid myself , and i needed this equipment for school .
product not opened or used .
so the salesman sent me to another store down the street from them .
so i purchase another kit for the installation .
terrible .
avoid this store .
he was behind the register chatting with a customer about tech bs .
my mom did not like it .
should get _num_ stars at least knocked off for that .
finding staff is almost impossible .
the layout of the new store is a royal pain .
and it generally seems like there is _num_ person that really knows his stuff .
and this was a full sized tower .
from when i got my copy of diablo _num_ from them .
not as the store it is today .
service here is usually never good for us .
did not like the return policy .
but never once offered to help me .
i get that the return policy is _num_ days , but come on .
horrible service .
nobody to even help find out if they have more product in the back .
not surprised they have under two stars .
horrible phone service !
too bad .
the associate continued to flounder through helping us .
and i know she was probably overwhelmed with all those customers on a tuesday .
sales people are clueless .
poor service .
this store sucked .
poor poor customer assistance .
big waste of time !
would not recommend !
i do n't get it .
i purchased _num_ tvs from arrowhead best buy in august for my new home .
i was extremely frustrated .
another week goes a part comes in geek squad comes to repair .
they were not able to fix .
i will not be using you .

sure enough there was a step he forgot .
horrible horrible customer service !
-the service is crap !
the operator transferred me to the store manager john ( sp ? )

do n't go here for your banking .
another thing to beware of is fees .

totally disappointed .
( strike _num_ ! )
just go in , buy , & leave !
( strike _num_ !
such a shame .
i just wish that the employees here knew more about their products .
i dunno .
that is evident by the constant presence of phoenix police standing right outside .
this place sucks .
i 'm _num_ .
which is n't too far away .
racist guy .
everything on their menu was fried , fried , and more fried .
its small bar that wishes it was a night club .
did n't fit in .
this place just sucks !
horrible .
this is why we rarely shop here .
this store is disgusting !
first off the dressing rooms are never clean .
it is a saturday with many shoppers yet half the dressing rooms were closed .
worse then walmart .
i do n't recommend going to macayos .
so i ordered the carne asada tacos .
wrong .
ugh .
this is a typical mexican chain restaurant .
the margaritas are terrible .
the salsa is thin , but tolerable .
she quickly took it back and brought out my correct order .
our waitress did handle my sending back the order without any fuss .
a friend of mine recently insisted on going to macayo 's for dinner .
the service was terrible .
margarita was weak also .
chips and salsa was delivered .
it was salty , and without any sense of seasoning .
worse service anywhere .
damn drinks were $ 10+ .
oh but happy hour does n't apply to the dining side .
worst experience ever .
macayos is not as good as i remembered .
they gave me correct price , and my order .
i get back to my van n check my bags .
and ive gone in and out twice cause she didnt properly check my bags .
i 'll know better next time i guess .
sent beer back .
came back _num_ times asking if we really wanted it with guac and beef .
not happy and not coming back .

tonight was horrible !
food was gross .
stale chips no hot sauce .
waitress was terrible .
she said sit where ever you want .
hahaha worst service here !
pathetic .
nothing stood out to me .
worst experience ever .
however , the rice and beans tasted way off .
their espresso is so bitter .
they 're incredibly slow .
you were rude today !
um yeah i just drank coffee .
went in for my coffee at 11am and they are out of vanilla flavoring .
obviously not a well stocked location !
the hair stylists are always not always smiling , although the manager is friendly .
i walked in to have my hair cut .
my hair was down to the middle of my back .
wash and blow dry only .
had to tell her in the end to blow dry it back .
a blow dry should be one of the simple things .
such a disappointment .
i feel that a tip is earned .
not going back .
their online banking is for the birds .
does anyone who designs these sites understand the process of paying bills online ?
but other people require longer depending on what all they need to do .
i went to the atm here to take out $ _num_ .
do not rent from this place !
they put a deal on my credit for $ _num_ .
math fuzzy , ?
in the summer rental rates go down last i checked .
instead you just posted it on my credit .
my food was terrible .
ordered chicken nuggets and french fries .
if you ca n't provide good customer service , i.e .
go f $ & ?
later i 'm having the exact parts replaced for $ _num_ cheaper .
)
, treated me like an idiot .
gave me real attitude .
lazy ass piss poor food .
somehow glendale gave these people a _num_ star ?
salad is just a cheap head of iceberg lettuce chopped up .
not my best decision .
i substituted the rice that it normally comes with for vegetables .
the food does not taste fresh anymore .
the drinks are definitely not on special and i think they 're pricey .
my bottled beer was about $ _num_ .
also not on special .
no , thanks .
the tacos are my favorite there i give them a 4/5 .
stopped in on the way to work for a breakfast burrito .
been here before quite some time ago probably for a burro .
no potatoes ... .
_num_ stars = meh .
chorizo and egg burrito was very greasy .
i was eating my shrimp burrito , which was delicious .
needless to say , my appetite was done for .
i only actually needed _num_ filling .
i used this dentist for at least a couple years .
i had tooth problems every month or so according to them .
also , the service is really generic .
it 's all very cheesy and overdone .
i do not know why .
it is terrible !
not a lot to say about it .
the chicken curry uses cheap cuts of meats .
went here friday night for some yummy indian food , and it was okay .
not the best indian restaurant but it will do !
buffet is worst .
worst place to have .
avoid this .
i would n't eat there again .
staff is fast on refills of water which is always appreciated .
oh well we are renting a car this week and decided to use avis .
terrible business decision .
do n't shop here if your preferred payment method is american express .
as soon as i pulled around the corner , my vehicle died .
i called aaa and my battery cable was conveniently lose .
not good .
have had my car serviced here before and it was fine .
i sold them _num_ hard copy books in great condition .

awful customer service .
horrible !
can this `` steakhouse '' ever cook a steak as it was ordered ?
came for prime rib it is 8:00 and they are already out of prime .
we were greeted by a friendly hostess , the immediately sat .
the service was terrible .
ruined my christmas .
why only _num_ stars ?
customer service is horrible .
tonight i had the prime rib .
they tasted okay but cold .
sent it back politely .
waiter was not happy .
disappointing food .
nine more minutes .
poor people , though .
not so much .
overall very poor service .
the bar is lame .
total should be $ _num_ .
so , i like the atmosphere .
the food was alright , but mostly the service was deplorable .
the waitresses clearly hate working there .
would not recommend .
once there the food was prepared quickly and looked good .
poor service and dishonest waitresses .
it gets very crowded .
their happy hour stinks .
their drink specials are limited to certain kinds of beer .
there is a large outdoor smokers patio with tvs outside .
if you want to watch sports here , get here _num_ hours early .
way too crowded .
that 's desperate , yo !
it fails at best .
shame !
this place reeks of a summer 's eve .
for full disclosure , though , i was there during a ufc fight .
last night , tuesday i went for dinner with a friend .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
kitchen closed at _num_ ; _num_ pm ?
same thing for last _num_ years .
my guess is bad .
i would not call back .
so gross .
dirty place .
went in here after the gym to grab some lunch and a few drinks .
no one was smiling .
we were n't greeted with a friendly hello .
horrible service .
the checks were messed up at the end as well .
granted it was a monday night football , but staff accordingly .
waste of money .
today will probably be my last .
this place blows .
for the price , i 've had better bar food .
i 'd give a better rating if they just turned their music off .
this place sucks .
i was so frustrated .
ca n't stand this place .
beyond that , it is difficult to find good things about this place .
later , i saw him behind the front desk .
you 'd be hard pressed to find a safe challenging group fitness class .
absolutely inappropriate !
i never see anyone cleaning .
he joined _num_ hour fitness the same time i did .
never enough tellers .
but i had sprint for _num_ years and had an upgrade last november .
it 's ridiculous .
terrible terrible service .
worst customer service ever !
this led me to having to contact customer service yet again ... ... .
customer service called the store multiple times finally getting someone to answer the phone .
their network is horrible !
Very negative
i scheduled an appointment because i was going in during my lunch hour .
Negative
they are scum of the scum .
there are repair shops all over .
literally , left their office in tears .
too little to late .
told me to let his staff know where to send my dental records .
you shall not pass .
disappointing !
prices are obviously cheap .
they did not care though .
the units themselves seem a little older .
my ac unit frequently leaked all over the floor .
needless to say , the pool and spa are closed often because of this .
ridiculous !
this place should get _num_ stars !
_num_ .
_num_ .
was way too much hassle !
this was my second time to this nail salon for a pedicure .
wrong .
very very wrong .
he was cutting my skin and hurting me .
more like _num_ .
he put the hot stones on my foot first and i yelped !
it was so incredibly hot i felt it burn my skin .
i had to pull my foot away and say you are burning me !
that 's too hot fo her !
very rude customer service .
only come here if you have all freaking day to spend on an appointment .
the staff acts like they are there for a pay check .
worst walgreens !
i 'm not a doctor .
i ca n't stand midas .
i took my girlfriends car there to get her fuel pump replaced .
waste of time .
horrible !
completely disgusting morons !
complete idiots !
horrible !
practically the first words out of the owner were , `` call _num_ . ''
bad choice !
i 'm not in a good mood .
should have walked out , did n't .
sides : twice baked potato .
_num_ rounded to _num_ for the carrots .
the hot and sour soup was okay .
it was terrible !
nothing special here .
really bad .
quickly seated , drinks , and appetizer were great .
_num_ rounded down .
i started out with a side salad with their house creamy parmesan dressing .
it sucked .
this is not italian food .
will not be going back .
besides , i make better italian food myself ( thanks mom ) .
i ordered veal piccata and it was tiny there was two small thin medallions .
Negative
the service was horrible !
the food was just okay some of it was better than others .
they brought my husband root beer instead of coke .
the $ _num_ mini cannoli was going to break the bank ?
this was my first time at a carrabba 's , my husband 's too .
a long , curly one .
chicken brian she said .
just not good .
it was a nice red , but not the one we wanted .
dipping oil way too peppery !
( now that is cheap ! )
this was a moderately busy saturday night , and we were seated relatively quickly .
i really have to question the customer service training at this restaurant .
i just sat down !
anyways , dropped the car off the next day at the scheduled time .
will not be back .
find someone reputable .
bad idea .
spoke with joe he was helpful in tire selection .
i went home to to the oil change myself , and lo and behold !
i will be avoiding this place from now on .
worst service ever !
yes _num_ hours and a half !
not to mention that i want to support local business .
what a disappointment !
they seem to like chatting with one another , though .
it made my day just coming to get lunch !
and tasted absolutely gross .
this place sucked .
our `` non smoking '' seemed like an ash tray .
absolutely horrible service .
we went about our day , came in late and went to sleep .
poorly managed !
less than _num_ tv channels !
i have n't run into that in a while !
a little warmer than room temp .
we had _num_ already .
went on line and was quoted about $ _num_ so we set an appointment .
new employees , same complete idiot type .
just save your money .
last one i had smelt like corn chips at this location .
do n't bother .
Negative
pizza hut has been my favorite for years .
a horrible experience .
ruined my dinner .
i would not buy there again .
a disappointing visit .
i was having problems with my car stereo .
want inexpensive audio equipment ?
horrible !
very disappointed .
long time customer but probably not anymore .
they said this exact quote to others dropping off cars too .
_num_ mins .
at _num_ hr and _num_ mins .
about _num_ mins .
Neutral
well after talking with him i feel even less valued .
this is just a communication issue , now lets get to the product .
its more than originally quoted , but i say ok and move forward .
very disappointed .
i 'm not crazy enough to allow this girl to touch me again !
you 'll regret it like i do .
ugh so yucky and unpleasant .
the manager acknowledged this is a new groomer and appreciated the feed back .
service is inconsistent .
they have about a dozen televisions in the bar plus trivia , and karaoke .
_num_ starts rounded to _num_ .
they have specialty medium pizzas around _num_ .
for a large pizza it costs _num_ and up .
my fiance shared her salad and some other dish with our _num_ year old .
tonight i was very dissapointed .
all three of us got the cheese cake for dessert .
recently though , i have not been happy with the service .
key word was cold !
service was horrible .
for dinner we there almost _num_ hours !
appetizers were cold .
did n't stay for our meals .
horrible management !
i present it to him and he quickly takes it over to the manager .
something smells fishy ... .
is old chicago holding its customers to a higher standard ?
and why will other restaurants accept the id except for them ?
the manager comes out and tells me they are out of meatballs .
i could lift my cheese right off like paper .
this place does not know quality .
my dogs can cook better then the cooks there .
i 've seen more chicken in a chicken nugget .
this experience was n't the best .
kinda sad this trip .
then met up with carlos _num_ week later to go over designs etc .
would you really trust someone like this to do a big project ?
i know they have some good reviews , but this was my experience .
kelly from thunderbird pools called me back and explained what they do .
is your pool not quite what you 'd like it to be ?
however , the server was pretty friendly and fast .
also , he does n't like baseball .
i never stepped foot back in there , and i was a regular customer .
the good news is that i got my sushi fix .
it looks very shabby . ''
this place really let us down .
we would definitely check out this place again .
sushi did not taste fresh .
i 'm seriously not understanding what there is to like here .
the salmon to cream cheese ratio was out of control !
nothing special , really .
i 've tried this restaurant twice , and it has n't been okay .
for you sushi lovers out there , i would look else where .
however a friend had a birthday dinner here recently and so we went back .
unsanitary disgusting , and disappointing !
wow how rude !
instead of drinking your bottle of beer like you 're at the curb .
no wow factor here .
tonight was awful .
the table next to us was getting their food ( dessert ) before us .
turns out ... , this `` big party '' was next to us .
server continued to ignore us .
i went for lunch , the specials were just okay .
terrible service !
nothing to shout about imo .
so bad night indeed .
probably not .
also my roll was tiny and had very little fish .
the restaurant itself is a bit cramped and crowded during rush hours .
sushi was eh .
lunch specials are cheap for a reason .
stupid .
it is literally like hitting your ball off of the sidewalk .
i understand they are there to make sure the course is being respected .
always a long wait here .
plus , i just ca n't did anything nice to say .
i consider just going to a different cox store .
they 're not really informative about anything .
ah , my friends , but that would be efficient .
and cox is not efficient .
they never have enough staff and the wait is always crazy .
and still no supervisor .
pathetic .
paying over _num_ a month to be treated like this !
i ordered chicken and shrimp w/ white rice and vegetables .
horrible service !
not cool .
the sushi was not impressive .
mediocre at best .
felt as though staff rushed us .
did n't even complete our meal .
it was completely empty .
it was just mediocre .
or you 'll scare away your customers !
food is extremely salty .
the california roll has too much mayo .
i cant sleep my chest hurts from all the sodium .
that was gross .
i have been a server , manager and never complain .
when he comes into the room he says , want to see your baby ?
unacceptable .
tonight me and some friends went as a group of five .
this location can be simply put as average .
it was pathetic .
um its not and shes _num_ !
Negative
avoid at all costs !
it seems service is going out the window .
prices are a bit high considering the low service levels .
so beyond rude .
rude blonde lady .
who was working the cash register for two games and rental shoes .
him : `` they 're basically the same price .
can you please void the transaction ? ''
kind of pricey considering we had a _num_ and _num_ year old with us .
gross .
i mean , seriously ?
here 's an idea , put your hours of operation somewhere on your website !
this was neither .
fishy and rubbery .
she was a little more impressed with her dish than i was mine .
so apparently everything has changed at our favorite neighborhood mexican place .
the service was horrible .
do n't recommend going here at all .
is there a such thing as a nice or clean walmart ?
inventory was very low , everything was out of order .
one stop store that has both retail and grocery .
never enough registers open .
this walmart is terrible .
disappointed .
they replaced the tire and i was on my way .
our waitress set waitresses back _num_ 's of years .
she was terrible .
everything is drenched in sauce , everything .
anyone who has had real bbq would laugh at this place .
i ordered two racks and a pound of brisket to go .
one rack i ordered dry so i could see what they really look like .
way too thin , way too gray and tough .
did n't get appetizers .
well , it was very dry .
plain all around bad .
it was like eating dirt with barbeque sauce poured on it .
my boyfriend had a combo platter of _num_ meats .
ugh .
does anyone really think this is even bbq ?
its more like roasted meat with sauce poured over it .
that `` guy '' dude must be smoking crack or getting paid off .
disappointed !
saturday afternoon was my third visit to this restaurant .
the seem to skimp on the slaw .
the mashed potatoes were not good .
they have too many sides .
i tried my bbq favorite in the beef brisket .
neither worked for me .
shoot i am so there .
food was terrible .
chocolate shake , service price all ok.
it was mushy and watery .
fucking pathetic .
for our sides we got corn bread with honey butter and mashed potatoes .
everything felt kinda dry .
the man vs food review was way off !
on the last leg of our journey we reached phoenix at about 1pm .
this visit more than confirmed my opinion .
service was slow and horrible .
it is eclectic , but not in a way that matches .
but , the server knew their stuff so that was appreciated .
probably not .
do i regret going ?
our appetizers came out and were huge onion rings and fried pickles .
was like any other typical bbq place .
unsure why there was so much hype .
service was slow .
our hope was to find a better experience than our weekend prior .
we were very disappointed !
the sides were disappointing .
the baked beans tasted much like they came out of a can .
tasted sour and bitter .
but service was slow .
the only decent thing about this place is the food .
the pulled pork and chicken is out of this world .
this place is a complete dive , though .
we came in a half hour before close , _num_ adults , _num_ kids .
i tried the bbq 'd turkey first .
another almost cold and very dry .
i really hate dry chicken .
he also said the pork ribs were better than the beef rib .
but ... ... .
wait time is really long .
so disappointing .
it 's unfortunate .
i really wished this place was better than what we got .
took their three kids in for lunch .
sat down , every eye in the place was on them .
the one time i ate in the restaurant , i ordered a plain burger .
i order mac n cheese for my son and it was from a box .
we started with the fried pickles ... they were awesome !
the ribs and brisket were very tender .
not our place .
pulled pork was always cold , and dry .
and it just never made us leave smiling or full .
fries were decent .
macaroni and cheese is the kind from the blue box .
meat was dry and overpriced .
my boyfriend and i tried the sampler platter .
we also ordered fried pickles as an appetizer .
everything else was sub par .
i was highly disappointed .
fried pickles were tasty , the batter was light and crispy .
i ordered the pulled port dinner with mashed and corn on the cob .
mashed was nothing special .
the brisket was awful .
after tasting the food , it 's pretty obvious why .
the appetizers were tasty and not boxed frozen product which was nice .
as my sides i chose coleslaw and mac and cheese .
it was barely warm .
gross !
this place is not good .
food was cold and not fresh .
fried zucchini appetizer was delicious , i always prefer battered over breaded .
the corn bread tastes like sand .
they should just become like a meat and deli spot .
cold uncooked meat .
first time here after driving past it for over _num_ yrs !
the brownie was a lil ' debbie .
i could n't eat more than two bites .
gave it another shot and asked for their best dish .
was sorely disappointed both times .
ribs , chicken , brisket was ordered and it was all so-so .
meat was dry and cold .
not worth the hype .
not impressed and never going back .
the cornbread was dry .
the best part of the $ _num_ meal was the chili and mashed potatoes .
a very disappointing experience .
very weird !
poor customer service .
just walked out .
bad first impression !
why lie , debbie ?
i do n't get it .
i 'm still treated as an inconvenience every single time i 'm in there .
the service sucks sucks sucks .
this is a typical _num_ star timeshare `` resort '' .
never again with this resort .
a little less than thrilled with that .
at this point i left .
because there is _num_ person that 's it !
guess i 'll keep looking .
last week my husband brought in the dog to get her nails filed down .
disappointing .
i was so sadly wrong .
after two more days i then contacted corporate office .
two days ago my dog visited the groomer at this location .
today my dog visited the vet at this location .
not friendly at all .
seriously lacking .
very bad customer service .
do not use this alterations business .
ripoff alert !
went through the drive-through , and ordered the thursday taco special for $ _num_ .
would n't recommend going here .
just ate at this shit box , ajo al 's in glendale .
completely downhill from there .
)
not this place .
not spicy at all .
when i got my meal , they were definitely not handmade .
mediocre .
it was more like veggie fajitas .
sorry , no go .
i am sure she expected the typical `` fine '' .
my food literally tasted like nothing .
my sons hamburger was dry .
not the best , but much better and cheaper .
oh , ajo al 's .
do n't drop the check before asking if we want dessert .
no wonder !
skip this place !
very odd and puts the patron in a difficult situation to figure out .
sadly disappointed .
it tasted like bagged salad .
i ordered a chicken taco and enchiladas .
the wait staff promptly addressed their seating needs and sat them .
i will not be back .
we walked in early on a sunday afternoon .
but the deal killer is the wait staff .
we will be using yelp to find another mexican restaurant in glendale or phoenix .
the food handling in the kitchen is questionable .
very bad experience .
shrimp fajitas were $ _num_ .
chicken fajitas were $ _num_ .
not anymore !
the hot and sour soup had peas ... peas !
not the best ... or even average .
next time ill just go to panda express across the street .
should be trash out .
we 've eaten a lot of chinese takeout over the years .
Negative
did n't finish it .
crab puffs were pretty small , though .
an example is the shrimp in garlic sauce .
we ate here for the last time on friday .
but this review is n't about the food .
big mistake .
sad , sad , sad .
no third try coming .
_num_ stars , barely .
i 've had better frozen chinese food and made better at home .
Negative
the food is disgusting .
it 's just not good .
delivery is not very good !
it had no taste .
i ordered the wonton soup , chicken chow mein , and mongolian beef .
the restaurant is too small and crowded .
the place is too small and crowded to enjoy your meal .
the service was terrible .
do n't say you 're delivery if you 're only delivery after 5pm .
bad idea .
not worth it .
mongolian beef was slightly sweet , but that was basically the only seasoning .
absolutely terrible food !
hardly had any sauce .
tastes just like fried chicken .
bland and no flavor .
i 'm sure i can find better tasting chinese food .
chicken cuts are better than most chinese places , and the recipes are original .
will not be returning .
i added some soy sauce , japanese red pepper and salt & pepper .
it will be a while till we try this again.
i 'm not entirely sure how anyone eats here once they 've been inside .
i 'm sure it 's the healthier option anyway .
how one does this i am entirely unsure .
this place drives me nuts !
i had a question and apparently questions do n't fly out at the menu .
frustrating .
typical visit at this place .
dirty tables and floors .
not service dogs .
just any ol dogs .
it 's my least favorite del taco .
no cheese .
very rude .
i was the only customer in there and she seemed distracted .
this is not subway standards .
work very lazy .
and very very bad .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the wings were much better , in my opinion .
the service was mediocre .
very disappointing management decisions .
rude owner !
not impressed .
disappointed .
the small amount of clams were very tender .
worst customer service anywhere .
such a disgrace .
glendale is better without you .
this is one of my least favorite home depot locations .
all else being equal , i 'd go to a different location .
worst customer service consistently .
are you kidding me ?
we have been loyal customers and have spent thousands over the years .
not worth the effort really .
not happy !
i get to the salon and they have temporary hours .
when normally they are open til 8pm .
drove down and definitely are closed on sundays .
wo n't be back .
she never returned my call .
this place is awful .
this place sucks so bad !
so not worth the price .
each new patron that walked in had a new one put it .
i was terrified to see what she had done .
are you kidding me ?
not quite the mcdonalds as that would be of course reserved for taco bell .
hot salsa tastes like marinara sauce .
rubio 's puts guacamole on theirs by default .
nothing to write home about .
i get the same thing everytime i go to rubios .
hello , i know what i want to eat !
disappointing to be sure .
then and only then will you know what i 'm talking about .
i had to circle the entire store to find one customer service representative .
maybe she has a routine .
it hurts to walk .
i guess that 's what i get for trying to save $ _num_ .
all around just not good !
nothing special .
no lattes .
yes really .
gross !
this particular restaurant is not set up well .
to hell with it !
i went into this dining experience with fairly reasonable expectations .
_num_ .
this goes for silverware as well .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i called my bank immediately and went in to tell the owner .
not a big fan of this store .
avoid if you can .
he felt that the rice to beef ratio was extremely off .
it was a tad under $ _num_ total for the both of us .
i havent the slightest of ideas as to how this place is still open .
this place made panda express seem like fine dinning .
the meat was dry .
walked in today to browse around , then se something interesting .
really , next time , are you serious .
absolutely horrible customer service .
this is not acceptable .
excuse me ?
worst management !
very frustrating .
this is my second time visiting this store location .
so i stood by the register hoping someone would say something .
unacceptable .
_num_ stars if i could .
i will never ever step foot in this mac ever again .
this was the store that i purchased my starter kit from years ago .
instead they just see dollar signs whenever a customer walks through the door .
workers are unhelpful and horribly rude .
ate at this place a few days back .
my tab for fajitas and a soda was just under $ _num_ .
will not be going back !
cheap and pretty quick .
terrible customer service .
not always the case .
my friend had the chicken and steak tacos .
disgusting and expensive .
they are terrible !
trying to get more money ?
they are terrible .

whole experience weird in comparison to other places .
would not go back .
Negative

terrible service .
she did n't return my call .
after they came out and cleaned it they called me to follow up .
poor customer service .
hot bagels and deli .
slight central european accent .
i was very put off to say the least .
and they put way to much cream cheese on .
went to hot bagels twice , first time near closing time .
horrible customer service !
they are not the same thing .
impressions : _num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
not even close .
obviously , the owner has never been to a real deli .
!
unbelievable .
( $ _num_ and $ _num_ ) .
the desserts were terrible .
instead , tasted like chocolate souffle .
not impressed .
yikes ... .
save your time and money .
the lines at the deli and bakery are almost out the door .
will not be back .
she had been there recently , too and pretty much had the same experience .
actually , just kidding .
or go to whole foods or sprouts for better quality / health food .
how disappointing !
overpriced at half the price !
i was completely disgusted .
horrible experience .
i had my knee surgery here back in january .
some computer problem .
but do n't ignore me .
i 'm in pain .
then he walked out .
the first nurse she encountered was somewhat friendly .
arrowhead er sucks .
arrowhead is awful !
then it was well we need to change your antibiotics .
that is unacceptable !
that 's not a good enough reason .
they were not professional .
my son was finally transferred to phoenix children 's hospital where he later died .
thankfully we got transferred to a single room so i can stay night .
never use this hospital .
worst experience ever !
had my daughter there with dr. austin who was an absolute monster !
how horrible !
they rush you in and out like you are a cow !
poorly maintained .
terrible day .
terrible breakfast sandwich .
when calling the clubhouse , the phone just rang .
the other major downfall is the amount of bird shit all over the place .
it 's disgusting .
majority of employees need a lesson on customer service .
so very disappointed .
no ice in cooler .
cart girl came by once in _num_ holes .
no excuse for that .
this place should be called pick up sodium .
skip this place .
this place is awful .
Very negative
you wait over an hour every time .
got through today , after phone rang off hook a few more times .
reception rude .
2nd , i bring my child back for a follow up two days later .
any problem i had was treated very promptly .
waited another _num_ min for a cashier to pay .
minute later out comes a younger gal from in back .
police report filed .
bad and old food .
we had _num_ cheeseburgers with everything on them except bacon .
this place is terrible .
does n't even deserve one star !
this one is awful .
where do i begin ?
no apologies .
employees never smiled .
our family used to really like your chicken and burgers !
horrible horrible place !
wrong !
wrong again !
because the teeth cleaning is not included in the package .
horrible communication .
we sat down , waited .
on my fist visit they put me with a pa not a doctor .
terrible !
i have gone other times though , and it was fine .
my sister in law got a # _num_ which is just the basics .
this made me really mad .
omg i could have gotten a total pedicure for that .
what a ripoff .
not a fan .
messy rolls that all tasted the same .
bland tempura .
no bueno .
i guess ill start by pointing out what i liked .
the decor is not cheesy .
the service was mediocre .
the salmon was n't fresh .
i was wrong .
every `` roll '' was a giant pre-made california roll topped with something else .
if i could give it less than _num_ star i would .
the fried fish special was eh .
i searched yelp to try find decent sushi while visiting phoenix with my family .
not real crab .
we will not go back .
i stopped in tonight and sat at the bar for some sashimi .
but it was almost gone by the time my rice came .
not coming here again .
this restaurant is not worthy of the rating .
my date and i started off with a bowl of ramen to share .
also , the color of the tuna was off .
if it 's quantity you 're after , this is the place .
for sure not somewhere we will return .
i still tipped _num_ % regardless because i know the other servers deserved it .
this is simply okay strip mall italian .
pizza was so-so .
my roommate ordered the spaghetti and meatball special but with less sauce .
it was a less than superb outing this time .
umm , no ?
pastas are so-so .
i 'm sure i could have whipped up something similar at home .
i think i might even chosen olive garden 's pasta dishes over theirs .
spaghetti ... meat balls .
i do n't mind paying extra for what i want .
i also dipped their bread in the salad dressing .
so sad .
horribly disappointed .
the place was packed and very noisy !
went there hoping for the experience i had _num_ years ago .
for _num_ you get _num_ % buttery pasta and _num_ % meat .
just recently stopped in for lunch .
another restaurant that i want to really like but ... ... ... ... .
not good at all .
if i were you i would highly recommend not sitting on the patio area !
my pizza was not even warm .
the service was pathetic .
horrible service !

the worst service ever .
the owner is a _num_ !

the lady who was my replacement was a hairdresser not a nail tech .
she had zero experience .

very disappointing experience .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .

they are always out of food and the wait time feels like forever .
Neutral

car wash sucks .
Negative
negative star .
cashier says `` sir i cant sell you the beer .
no hello .
i 'm never buying food from here again .
i hate this location .
i get up there and she takes off after another lady .
they are clueless .
it rang up as $ _num_ so i told the clerk .
check out the pictures i posted , clearly labeled $ _num_ .

there was ginger and snow peas in it when it arrived .
i 'll miss having a gluten-free restaurant in my area .
not a very good place for sushi or service .
first timer , never again .
also , i ordered the udon vegetable .
now fried rice is _num_ dollar extra .
do n't try to use your entertainment coupon here .
bad form ... .
terrible customer service .
said only a truck was guaranteed , not a specific size .
very frustrating .
i could have saved the money and used my freaking mini van !
are you kidding me ?
very slow service .
this company may be the least professional bunch of thieves in existence .
this location is for avis and budget .
it 's very hard to find staff help when you need it .
it 's run by bed bath and beyond .
they take all coupons , even bed bath and beyond .
try avoiding him as much as you can !
i was buying this for my _num_ year old son .
luckily , it is priced accordingly .
ridiculous .

one employee can lose a regular customer .
all _num_ times i ordered pizza and wings with ranch .
awful customer service .
my grande margarita arrived sans alcohol .
i ordered the carne asada , which normally comes with salsa and hatch chilies .
my son 's grilled cheese and fries were hot .
Negative
bottom line , do n't ever try the beer there .
ugh .
the quesadilla was one flour tortilla folded in half .
that to me is really a half of a quesadilla not a full one .
especially for $ _num_ .
no drinks .
i believe that a plain cheese crisp was 5-6 bucks !
no way !
it was just ordinary mexican food .
after four requests , they finally shut it off .
no stars !
this visit really is n't different than my last one .
the waiter had to advise me it 'll be hot .
lol ok whatever .
very sloppy .
it tasted straight out of the can tho .
gross .
i 'm sure they get hatch food service cans or something .
the food is n't new mexican .
again , the stacked beef enchilada 's were void of any flavor at all !
what a disappointment .
what a disappointment .
no check .
nothing special .
no appetizer !
no tip !
there was something incredibly strange tasting about my drink .
horrible service !
we went here today around _num_ o'clock on a saturday .
the crispy cheese crisp was alright .
the refried beans were just alright .
but this one just tastes like boxed macaroni and cheese .
Negative
no beans .
the host was rude .
they did not even say hi .
we were regulars , but never treated as such .
this is why we kept going back .
the bean dip was good , w/ a little spice in it .
our server was quick and efficient , and brought our drinks out quickly .
the only complaint i had was the size of the chimi .
garbage !
my daughter also disliked the beans .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
told the mgr .
i use to come here quite often for their happy hour .
_num_ cent margaritas and half off all appetizers .
i do n't care !
we ordered beef chimis and a cheese crisp to share .
he says , and leaves us .
the service was horrible !
never had our waters refilled .
extremely slow service here .
fajitas were very tough .
overall a poor experience .
terrible queso .
not the right choice with so many others in the area .
first you notice the sign out front that they are hiring servers !
food was n't that great .
service was slow .
it was just drowned in sauce .
over all im so much happier to go to outback steakhouse .
salad was dismal .
garlic mashed potatoes were a joke .
more like dry wall paste .
gross !
tried this place because we had a coupon .
the place seems to have customers every night .
just not us .
i will not be returning .
then waited approximately _num_ mins .
scratch my prior review .
bloody is not medium well .
i felt totally unwelcome .
the manager himself brought our plates and insisted my husband checks his meat .
omg tonight was completely different .
what restaurant runs out of a premier brand .
grease pit .
do n't eat here .
terrible burgers and steaks .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i guess we could have gone over and gotten drinks and come back .
no hard feelings .
i booked a room that night .
turns out , she was our server for the night .
first , let 's just just get this out of the way .
upgrades are needed all around .
this rock bottom brewery might be a good place start .
the veggie quesadillas were ok .
the steak i ordered was mostly fat rather than meat .
no beer .
no water .
i messed up ... i 'll grab them . ''
service was terrible .
i 've never been served such old meat that it was grey all over .
guac was just avocados chopped up .
horrible .
horrible .
horrible .
as for my ribeye steak ?
_num_ on a monday night .
not a terrible burger .
will not be back .
burger was just ok .
the waitress was awesome and deserves to work at a better establishment .
it pains me to leave this review .
but it needs to be done .
excuse me ?
as in we fed her too much .
my child is in the lower % for weight .
search on yelp had more closed than open .
rude rude rude !
not hers .
very poor operation .
the replacement battery are extremely expensive .
i would advise any customers who encounter similar problems to do the same .
but that 's not true .
my technician talked the entire time about her baby daddy and all her issues .
i was very excited to get this massage .
my therapist greeted me on time and took my back to the room .
not worth _num_ bucks !
she finally comes back in and starts the massage .
does n't even make sense !
my very first massage the lady completely pressured me into doing the membership .
worst massage ever !
she had the same therapist each time ... elizabeth .
no complaints there .
awful and unprofessional .
fine by me , we have n't touched the original pizza .
terrible pizza .
will not be back .
not good guys not good at all .
horrible !
do n't go to this location .
not thrilled .
seemed bland .
this `` mexican '' dining experience is the least authentic i 've ever had .
the beans were alright , as was the rice .
not something i 'd want again .
i will not go back again .
maybe _num_ stars .
the black beans were good , the rice ... meh .
both my kids told me that my own homemade quesadillas are much better .
major disappointment .
i finally convinced the waiter of my order which was to be chicken quesadilla .
no more ignoring ratings .
this experience taught me you all know what you are talking about !
horrible horrible service .
that was all he was willing to take off .
are n't people just glad to have a job these days ?
i feel that the pv dillard 's is a better location anyway .
horrible shoe department .
their policy is _num_ days !
what a rip-off !
they refused .
ironic , the identical frame i ordered looked just fine .
no way !
this place was terrible .
very sloppy work .
that 's too much money anyway .
terrible experience .
wo n't be back .
the god was good but very small rolls over priced in my opinion .
so apparently the manager is an idiot .
worst business ever award .
this is a dumb !
gross old dumb !
are they dense !
so i head over to babies r us and the manager was extremely helpful .
they should fire everybody including the manager for patronizing customers .
today will be the last time i shop at toys r us .
rude customer service .
i 'm also not particularly impressed with the photo borders they have on offer .
plus , we have to wait a week for our pics .
i would not go to them ever again .
for a tuesday , it was hella crowded with old peeps .
the waitress even apologized for the excessive wait time .
i had chicken fried steak , scrambled eggs , fruit and a muffin .
the gravy was sort of thin .
my wife ordered the usual broccoli quiche and it was only a little warm .
i was utterly speechless .
i mean , what on earth was she thinking ?
red velvet cupcake , not so much .
used to be much much better .
i had the blackened salmon and my parents had the roasted turkey breast .
it was just ok .
may i suggest blackened monterey chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries ?
i ordered the roasted turkey dinner .
it was n't good either .
terrible restaurant .
every surrounding restaurant is much better .
they do n't respect their customers .
then the waitress told me just try it first .
i was really , really disappoint it .
( i wrote this in march _num_ and just saw that it never posted .
what the hell happened ?
it was nasty .
are not as generous with them .
the place was empty .
menu seems to be getting smaller and smaller and less flavor and size .
i will not be back !
hit or miss .
service was the worst !
took _num_ hours .
only another waitress ever filled our drinks .
this place was horrible !
overall not impressed .
just plain rolls that were just okay .
do n't sit in the self seating area by the hostess area .
not good at all .
the place looked more like a dump than before .
not impressed .
that 's not service !
met others for lunch on a monday .
will not be returning .
ok not such a big deal , we 'll move past this .
i also ran a _num_ fever .
made reservation for small group ( _num_ ) .
typically its served on lettuce with fruit on a plate .
this was not the case .
it was ridiculous .
just wish management would pay attention .
very sad .
long service wait for food .
not that impressed .
you have a choice of fries , fruit , or salad as a side .
do n't waist your money .
had breakfast at mimi 's in glendale this past weekend .
because they were so busy , we sat at the bar .
raw dough quiche .
ok maybe i am too picky .
same for the hot tub .
do n't wait for weeks with claims of parts or estimates .
not buying it .
the neighbor upstairs has her tv and/or music ridiculously loud every night .
they charge for pest control fee every month but they 've only sprayed once !
this mall is ok .
construction mess and homeless !
a bus depot was put in there too .
that being said my review is about meet santa .
pathetic .
seriously this mall sucks .
every time i go i expect a surprise but same old arrowhead .
place smells like urine .
finally one girl around the benefit counter walked up and asked .
but if any one else walked up , they were served .
a store manager is never available to help with a problem as well .
i just walked away .
literally one associate working her tail off trying to help everyone .
returned today to return pants .
went up register where two associates are helping two customers with returns .
the worst service ever .
my boyfriend asked him again , is there any deals today for black friday ?
even the _num_ pound burger and bison burger got theirs before us .
avoid like the plague .
the bad .
the arcade game ( motorcycle one ) ate everyone 's money .
the manager returned our money , but commented that it happens all the time .
the arrowhead area has some stiff competition for dining .
a few ideas : lower prices , better arcade , just to start .
i was in complete shock .
overall this place need a complete makeover from management to menu .
my ( stupid stupid stupid ! )
horrible food .
the food was very average and plain .
it was simply blah .
you deserve more respect and money .
the restaurant was partially full .
i will not go back .
worst place ever !
nasty just nasty .
not the cleanest place but with the traffic they have i guess it passes .
very very bad .
disgusting !
not being to one in forever , now i remember why .
watery mac and cheese .
really the best thing is the chicken fingers , potato , and salad .
the pot roast is so dried at that it has the texture of jerky .
items are not replaced in a timely way .
i stopped in for a late lunch today at 2:30 .
sliders in dried up buns and warmed over tough meat .
so nasty !
the food just tasted old !
never ever going back .
have n't been here in years .
will not waste money .
my husband & i stopped for breakfast .
seafood salad had all the seafood picked out , food looked aged .
the rotisserie chicken was very dry .
the only think that seemed good was the chocolate milk .
went there on mothers day for lunch _num_ pm , dissapointed .
i will not be returning .
the food was awful !
disgusting !
some of the staff seem bitter .
the place needs some work though .
my wife and i have been ordering food from this establishment for years .
we have been loyal customers for years .
the people on united flight _num_ were treated better than i was .
however , beware that they use msg in their food .
the orange chicken my friend ordered was fine .
nothing to write home about .
ordered a staple of chinese restaurants : kung pao chicken .
like ordering pad thai at a thai restaurant .
it was bland and flavorless .
mediocre selection of vegetables .
i spoke to the manager and he gave me a rest .
she was nasty beyond nasty .
egg drop soup was pretty good but the orange chicken tasted kind of different .
ordered take out for the first time tonight and asked what they would recommend .
the only item we actually enjoyed were the crab puffs .
just ordered tonight .
i got the honey walnut shrimp and my husband ordered sweet & sour chicken .
i do not recommend .
went out golfing on black friday .
tee time at _num_ pm .
yep , just meh .
the pizza is pretty big , but bigger is not always better my friends .
the boys each ordered two slices of pizza and a drink .
so that family walked out !
lessons learned ... better communication is the key .
our first time at a brother 's pizza and our last .
it was still hot on the inside , but not piping hot .
watch the plate , it 's hot , the waitress said .
bad , bad service .
ordered the ziti and my husband had the spaghetti .
so disappointed !
again , disappointed .
this place is hit or miss .
the pizza and wings are never the same .
we really were excited when we saw a family owned neighborhood restaurant near by .
unfortunately , neither will we .
nothing on it ... just cheese .
it 's a hole in the wall .
they are always out of something , often it is chicken !
and blew me off .
it was rude and dismissive .
no more .
horrible !
mediocre at best .
i will not be going back !
do not eat at this kfc .
this was 5:30 pm on a friday night .
first time here , probably my last .
worst .
just ate the food they replaced .
horrible .
he then left the counter .
she then walked away .
whoever is the manager of this taco bell needs to be let go .
very poorly run restaurant .
terrible customer experience .
wo n't be back .
i have been going to this taco bell establishment for almost _num_ years .
shame .
i have been driving out to the _num_ for my copy and shipping needs .
no zero stars huh ?
from my memory the pizza was better than i remember but not great .
too bad !
service was horrible .
incredibly rude .
will not be a returning customer .
very below par pizza .
the crust was like shoe leather tonight and hard to eat .
last friday we ordered a thin crust cheese pizza .
hardly any sauce .
it was not crowded .
he had walked away .
i will not come here again .
... pretty gross !
ridiculous service !
terrible service .
they know they have max fields and kids without staff .
limited menu is terrible .
as it finished i drove there to pick it up .
looks like this one slipped through as i got sliced italian sausage not salami .
the pizza was ok .
i had to wait forever for it .
the service was terrible !
they are consistently inconsistent !
i 'm not eating here anymore
absolute idiots .
all i 'm asking for is some common courtesy and manners .
not much hot fudge and they charged extra for the nuts and whip cream .
so i guess their other mechanics ca n't change oil on cars .
this place is ridiculous !
terrible people skills .
everytime i go here to get my oil changed its just a rough experience .
unacceptable .
after a recent visit , they came up with needing a new fuel filter .
he said come on down , it 'll be a couple of hours .
the person who rang me up gave me a free oil change coupon .
never written a review on yelp and this is my first .
rude inconsiderate and unprofessional .
but , charging a customer for a tire that is covered by warranty ?
i popped my hood and checked out the battery .
Negative
absolutely aweful store will not return .
even the home shop in seattle is faster .
service here was slow .
i normally get my order to go or go through the drive thru .
i have tried this location several times , not a typical starbucks .
worst starbucks yet .
this place is disgusting .
terribly slow service every time.
literally nothing .
truly terrible service .
then it got worse .
someone answering the phone to make an appt would be nice too !
this practice has declined over the _num_ years i have taken my kids .
every time we pass by this place i suggest we stop .
it was awful !
ate there on saturday , june 5th .
i 've eaten here a few times and each time i ask myself why ?
but the health department needs to check this place out .
as for the food , the french toast and pancakes were fine .
the beer situation was weird .
_num_ of us ordered beer .
three of us apparently got the last cold beers .
he ordered the same dish as my husband ( chicken and biscuits ) .
my husband 's dish was cold .
the chicken tacos were fairly tasty but needed some salsa .
sadly , it was disappointing .
we were disappointed .
also , i 've had better pie .
in fact , i 've made better pie .
pie is $ _num_ a slice .
canned peas were not edible .
and i do n't scare easily .
we got to rock springs , and i was expecting it to be busy .
_num_ group of _num_ eating breakfast .
it came with `` country potatoes '' , and toast .
i 'm all done with rock springs .
no , seriously .
by the way , this was sunday afternoon with several customers inside .
why make buying pie so difficult ?
anyway , the pies were good , little pricey but good , not spectacular .
i stopped here on my way back from sedona .
i called rock springs and explained what pies i wanted , and why .
i called to confirm the pies on the thursday before .
when we cut into them i simply cried .
over twenty years of family history is gone .
so sad !
sadly both pies were sub-par .
i went about a month ago with a friend from out of town .
more like cobbler .
another reviewer said the place had recently changed hands .
it now sucks .
no special orders here .
it was very disappointing .
do n't bother stopping .
apple !
an ' wet bottom .
when we got there , how quickly things changed .
we all got a hamburger , salad and a small bowl of clam chowder .
my wife carol and kathy ordered a slice of pie for desert .
later since we stayed for karaoke we ordered potato skins appetizer .
service : the service was much slower this time around .
ambiance : an _num_ 's old western bar .
i would be willing to drive out of my way to this business .
lets say this place has so much potential but only managed to disappoint .
this is a shame .
two kids , five adults , _num_ pies - $ _num_ .
no smiles anywhere .
so i was looking forward to rock springs cafe .
the biscuit and gravy was unbelievable !
my husband and i have been coming to rock springs for years .
admittedly , they used to make good pie , although it is quite expensive .
mediocre food .
horrible service .
more horrible service .
if it is on the way , then sure , stop by .
but never go out of your way to go here .
i could only gag down two bites .
nothing at all flaky about it .
wo n't be back .
awkward .
i ordered the apple pie a la mode .
it tasted more like something whipped up in a commercial kitchen than something homemade .
stopped for lunch .
mediocre food .
not impressed .
too few servers ?
regarding staff : rough looking crowd , multiple mistakes .
it 's not .
never again rock springs , never again .
overall disappointed dining experience !
the chili was really spicy and low on beans .
the drinks , served in small mason jars cost $ _num_ each .
this was so basic it almost hurts .
literally a tortilla , lettuce , fried chicken , and mayo .
the bottom crust was all gooey .
twenty bucks thrown away .
it was horrible .
the noodles were thing special and they just used shredded cheese .
just left this joke of a restaurant .
imagine my surprise as plates of pancakes begin to come out of the kitchen !
we stopped here on our way back to phoenix from sedona .
it was horrible .
horrible service !
same wait . ''
the top crust is not flaky at all .
tourist trap for sure since its the only game in town .
my husband ordered the pulled pork reuben with home made chips .
grab some pie on the way to nosh on when we get home ! ''
)
more detail follows below .
not a single smile was seen .
i 'll get better customer service in a fast food drive thru .
had chicken an waffles , not great meal overall .
horrible customer service .
staff not friendly at all .
this was my second visit .
gross !
it was terrible .
not worth almost $ _num_ ... .
we all stopped to grab some food and a pie for home .
the pie was terrible !
very disappointed !
the chicken was hot but the mash potatoes and corn were warm .
the place was n't even full .
ordered pies for the holiday , chose the pay later option .
bad service.
well ... let 's just say we vote it as an experience .
for the pickles and bourbon pecan pie .
extremely disappointed !
wrong move !
we both had the two egg , sausage , home potatoes , and toast .
also , the prices were a bit high .
this place kinda sucks .
_num_ pm on a friday night .
not impressed .
the coleslaw was tasteless .
after lunch we ordered pies to go which i will say were outstanding .
thin .
but that pie , oh that pie will bring me back .
crappy breakfast and crappy service .
it 's called stupid !
not homemade at all , just a tourist trap .
menu is too limited .
extremely unfriendly staff .
this was my first visit to rock springs cafe .
and those expectations should be kept as low as possible .
why change things if customers are always coming in ?
greasy flavorless mexican food .
the food was nasty !
but this is not it .
would not suggest this to anyone .
i asked for _num_ taco , an enchilada , rice , beans and chips .
this place is horrible .
have n't eaten bk is a while .
chicken fries ) .
however , it is a low end medical clinic .
everyone deserves health care , but this is a dingy , overworked place .
i am prior military so i have eaten some not so good meals .
i 'm not a picky person .
i was disappointed .
terrible food !
my wife and i ate here last friday night .
there were n't many patrons inside when we got there .
i ordered two beef enchiladas with a beef taco , rice and beans .
barely edible .
horrible !
service is bad and slow .
servers are not trained in good service skills .
no apology .
if only they gave more attention and care to make their dishes taste better .
the restaurant is never busy when this happens .
but there are positives .
i am thinking the second statement was more accurate than the first .
nasty nasty nasty i was very disappointed .
worst experience ever .
as my childhood mexican diner , i have a fond spot for this place .
i could n't eat the rice .
i looked online and the menu had ground beef .
so he ordered fish tacos and i got a taco grande .
very disappointed !
i came here thinking it was a butcher shop .
it 's not .
it 's more like a small grocery store from the 70s .
not much of a selection .
clerk not particularly friendly .
that 's ridiculous !
i just walked out very mad !
very unprofessional and very rude !
very unnecessary !
it wasnt until i looked at my bank statement did i see the charges .
after checking in , i opened the blinds .
scared of the bed , so i slept with all of my clothes on .
i guess they knew better than to ask such a loaded question .
no , no , no !

it 's gross .
ugh .
gross .
nasty !

zero value .
i suggest you keep driving a few miles more where there are more options .
terrible customer service .

the bed was clean but springs could be felt through the mattress .
most folks stay one night and the leave .

it 's never been fresh .

disgusting !
it was just awkward .
this place is as ghetto as it gets .
the new company running it has not seemed to turn things around .
this is the second time i 've witnessed technical issues at this theater .
i have given them _num_ and _num_ chances and it never gets better .
even desert sucked .
i am a very fair person and i have given them the last chance .
i like the chicken enchilada soup and ceasar salad .
service is very slow .
only _num_ of us .
ick !
i have not gone to chili 's in a few years .
and recently i tried them again.
they are consistently disappointing .

shrimp is obviously frozen ( this is az after all ) .
i get another beer as the entrees are brought to the table .
he says ok let me take care of this i 'll be back .
at first he says i charge you for what you ate .
so tonight before i ordered tonight i ask .
none of them actually helped .
very frustrating .
no not coming back .
and stayed dirty .

the manager gave it to us for free .
today i was craving the steak and asparagus meal that is topped with shrimp .

bad experience .

_num_ .
that may have been the breaking point for all mcdonald 's .
Negative
manager did n't care .
_num_ stars to me .

very poor customer service .
food was just okay , server was just okay .
the food came quickly , and was hot but just adequate .

nothing really beyond that sticks out .
another table sat down at about the same time .

the pressure was on everyone to cut costs or die .
two of us said to substitute chicken for the turkey .

total disappointment .
the place was dead .
the dining experience was more like a pizza joint or bar .
but just upset their quality is getting lower and lower .
i ordered their chicken marsala and it was just drenched in oil .
never been here , but have always wanted to try it .
the benches at our table were designed for large people .
they start you off with some bread and olive oil with pepper dip .
the bread is baked with rosemary and topped with butter and salt .
it only tasted like rosemary .
so , it was returned for a salad .
the salad was great , the chicken was only okay .
the green salad was completely full of cabbage and very bitter .
not very appetizing .
it was terrible .
but i have eaten my last meal at this restaurant .
very strange experience .
they need to go eat at oreganos and get some tips on everything .

i ordered veggie fajitas but actual fajita veggies cost extra ?
very over priced for generic mexican food .

i always like to throw positives first as praise .
no bedside manner .
it never seems as though their patients and their needs are their main priority .
they 're ridiculous .
they 're just a corporation now that treat patients like dollar bill signs .
i ca n't wait to change primary care providers .
wait time is ridiculous .
my boyfriend ordered the same combo , as is .
they said they would remake our sandwiches .

no rating posted .
the day crew is why they even have _num_ stars .
house experience come on down to this location .
tonight sucked ass .
not a very good store in my opinion .
just horrible .
avoid !
this experience took longer than my kid 's entire visit to urgent care .
horrible !
this place is horrible .
i went here this past weekend with my sister for a pedi .
this place sucks .
it was clearly noticeable when she got home .
this is so unacceptable .
it is hard to find things at this place .
if they would update this location and upgrade staffing , it would rock .
target , please get self checkout .
zero stars .
if your pet is a patient , get your records and find another vet .
she did n't even look at me .
no appointment necessary .
very unpleasant and unprofessional !
disgusting .
went to wendy 's for dinner tonight .
i wish the fireplace actually put out heat .
the flavor was nothing special .
the sandwich was a whole lot more bread than pork though .
kinda sad really .
terrible breakfast .
cold and hard and obviously not fresh .
bad idea .
how rude .
horrible office .
they said i have gum disease , need a _num_ dollar cleaning .
my wife was in the other bay and had the same concerns .
their furniture seem old when you sit you sink in .
are you kidding me ?
i dont think we will be coming back to this location .
atmosphere , furniture was an improvement .
the appetizer was so skimpy compared to the visit before .
doubt ill be going to this location much more .
and they 're not even that busy .
this party of _num_ is taking their business to another restaurant .
i had orders buffalo chicken strips , french fries , and pancakes .
worst restaurant experience ever .
exceptionally slow .
ok all i can ask is why do we keep going to this place .
now i get attitude .
overcharged for shipping _num_ .
vs actual ups charge of _num_ .
they are terrible .
he needs training in customer service and manners .
web site says store opens at _num_ am .
i addressed the situation and showed the pics in this series .
so , albertsons # _num_ , get your act together .
are you kidding me ?
next time i called , they declined to accept her any longer .
ca n't recommend ever again .
such a disappointment .
horrible !
i am actually writing this as i am sitting here .
they opened the doors and i was the 2nd in line to get paperwork .
there were several people without appointments as well .
they keep answering the phone then hang up .
horrible experience here .
the leasing staff is constantly turning over .
for $ _num_ my burrito better be good , huge or both .
they give you a plastic tray with some chips and salsa and hot sauce .
i 'm not talking about `` authenticity '' .
it was gross and bland .
went here for lunch with coworkers .
drinks are in small styrofoam cups and cost _num_ bucks .
not a full service restaurant .
place your order at the counter , then sit and wait .
i like to try all little small business restaurants .
they have ten dollar plus plates and the silverware and plates are plastic .
i doubt it .
i ordered the chili colorado , what they called red chili beef .
they just desperately need a new cook .
later it was changed to 2pm .
the people working were doing their best , though .
it was unbelievably disappointing .
spend your money elsewhere .
next time i visit arizona i will select a different hotel .
maybe half a star , it had a bed .
somehow not as flavorful as i had imagined from the description , but decent .
the bar happy hour food was very over priced for taste and portion .
we attended a sit down dinner event at the resort last night .
terrible .
not a good meal .
we stayed for _num_ nights although our original reservation was for _num_ nights .
my advise , stay away .
wrong room .
wrong keys .
wrong relocated room .
wrong keys .
if you are planning a conference here , stop !
not staying here again .
just stayed here for _num_ nights .
very disappointing .
not _num_ times each .
looking toward the bed the room looked very nice .
there 's a sitting area and desk .
our room also had a very odd smell .
very disappointed !
we will not return next year .
gross !
once we began eating though , our table slowly became infested with flies .
it was disgusting .
visited the old pueblo for lunch .
however , the place is grimy and in huge need of some updating .
not impressed at all .
probably would not come back .
it almost takes effort to screw up mexican food !
they were absolutely horrible !
it came out stone cold .
they did n't even care !
i sent a letter to the owners and never got a response .
the taco bell i had the other day was more authentic .
service & food sucked .
now we know .
sometimes it a miss though .
their chile relleno made me gag .
the taste was disgusting .
no complaints .
it 's friday night , hire some attentive staff .
service was absolutely horrible .
our appetizers came out after our meals even though we kept asking for them .
the guacamole was tasteless .
service was not good at all .
wo n't be back .

food not good .
service not great and too loud .
horrible experience .

it took _num_ hours !
when i walked in the door .
here is a list of other problems .
crappy service .
came through the drive through to order ice cream and the machine is down .
who ever does the hiring here needs to hire more adults .
nor does the management .
instead of a dr pepper like i had ordered i received a diet something .
avoid this place .
i mean , where do all the farmers out here get their fuel ?
the zoo itself is substandard .
they all have a different name but serve overpriced hotdogs and subs .
first , the cost was ridiculously expensive .
i think i could have gone to disneyland for less .
there is limited shade so be prepared for the sun .
the $ _num_ admission fee does n't include any of the rides .
and for handicapped guests , $ _num_ wheelchair rental .
so sad .
the map was not accurate .
this was definitely my first and last visit to this zoo .
place reeks of piss .
but i do n't like it .
the aquarium is boring .
this place is crazy expensive to get into .
disappointed in this zoo .
not a lot of big game animals .
it was horrific !
overall , i ca n't recommend this zoo .
the aquarium is worth a visit , but not for $ _num_ .
incredibly depressing .
it 's hard to review this place .
some of the enclosed exhibits , e.g .
our vehicle was in plain sight !
he also looks miserable .
do n't wear flip flops or white shoes .
i do not recommend this place .
it has grown immensely .
they honestly do n't care .
wrong !
no , really ?
do n't leave anything in your car when you come here .
she granted is a groupon deal of $ _num_ off .
hello its _num_ !
totally feel taken advantage of !
is it to hide the money they make from us ?
bad experience !
looks and smells like you would catch something if you fell in !
in fact , it reminded me of a zoo in mexico .
they 're just letting it sink into the earth .
some of the exhibits needed attention too .
i was so disappointed .
i was disappointed .
rides are expensive since it literally last about a minute long .
food for _num_ cost $ _num_ .
the $ _num_ penguin sells on-line for 1/2 that price !
an overall disappointing experience .
wrong answer .
do not go here , save your money .
park maintenance not in good condition .
horrible ... disappointed ... .
the restrooms were disgusting .
how depressing for them .
fish tanks .
a water is $ _num_ .
no more .
not worth it .
never going back .
just do n't go there .
lots of flies and not so nice staff .
do n't stop for gas at this shell station .
it 's bad business .
so i can see where could could have created a problem for themselves .
store is n't very organized .
absolutely horrible service .
dumb .
i mean , really ?
the workers are terrible .
i 'm _num_ .
very terrible service .
they cant get simple orders correct .
hell no .
they just looked at me while i stood there .
no professionalism at all .
i walked out i was so mad .
me no likely .
they looked understaffed again .
did n't understand that .
they forgot my fries - they gave me a large fry .
horrible !
what a ripoff .
this location is awful .
we walked out and will never be back .
not much in the way of culinary excellence in sun city west .
dinner however was just blah .
bland .
we tried the _num_ for $ _num_ promotion .
i also received _num_ french fries on my plate !
that 's why i was surprised it came out so quick .
never a fan of this place .
wasted our money .
i hate that .
the service is horrible .
we ordered two bourbon street steaks and a grilled chicken salad .
the manager came over and just brushed everything off .
applebees surprise is off the list .
completely awful !
stopped off to get some dinner .
friday night 7pm is , and the place was fairly busy .
did n't finish it .
not worth the time or money .
i walked around hoping to grab the attention of someone working there .
this is unacceptable .
i 'm very disappointed .
this is n't a concert .
also , every time , my final cost has been more than the estimate .
do n't let them fool you too .
what a joke .
customer service is almost non existent .
i went to a chiropractor in the same parking lot as home depot .
they just sent someone outside to get them .
nothing has been resolved .
this is not the case .
i called the store and talked to two people to get some help .
home depot employees should take some customer service training from her .
this is my second visit to resolve an issue .
horrible experience !
not just a handful .
i stopped there the friday before easter to get a pedicure .
the dog was wearing a service coat .
i was n't happy .
looked fake .
more expensive then california .
pedicure was a rush .
nothing special .
very disappointed !
my husband was there for _num_ hours ( since store opened ) !
not good customer service !
very disappointed .
several days later i took them back to have the balance fixed .
do n't eat here !
she did not smile .
she gave me a new name `` order number _num_ . ''
ordered the mahi mahi , which appeared thick and succulent on menu photo .
ordered a rare ny strip , with salad , baked potato , and broccoli .
no broccoli .
i ca n't believe it .
never going back .
i mean , how hard is it to order a filet mignon ?
i am absolutely convinced it was some sort of cleaner .
Negative
my wife and i really gave this place a chance with four visits .
no more .
we had ordered ( _num_ ) steaks and ( _num_ ) burgers .
drinks never refilled .
i just wish the food was better .
first off , my mom and i ordered margaritas .
it was so disappointing .
service was terrible .
there are 5-6 tables where i am sitting .
this is unacceptable .
sat at the bar , very quiet there at _num_ pm .
bartender spent most of his time chatting with the waitstaff at the service bar .
_num_ minutes .
hit or miss at this location .
please temp the food please !
mainly fat and bone .
what a disaster !
very bad experience .
not _num_ out of _num_ .
so disappointing .
so i get my food and there were onions in my food .
otherwise , it is overwhelming for customers .
it 's horrible pizza .
hand leftovers decided not to eat them .
so when i happened on this place i fell in love .
now you got yourself a friday or saturday night meal !
the pepperoni 's were not cooked .
more like cardboard .
i dont usually write reviews but this one made me get the yelp app !
that was the only grocery store i would go to .
worst shop ever !
worst customer service ever !
no thanks !
we took our dog to this petsmart 's vet without appointment .
go anywhere else and you will get better service .
we left to run errands before my fiance suv was done .
tuesdays is ladies day $ _num_ off !
very unhappy .
however with each visit the quality goes down and the price goes up .
my last visit just _num_ months ago was probably a _num_ 1/2 stars .
i get to my truck to see dirt on my running boards .
no tire dressing .
wrong !
do not get a detail !
if i paid for a complete interior , i expect it to be spotless .
so we ca n't help you .
lady was rude .
very disappointed .
worst worst pedicure ever !
just the worst !
i could n't believe it .
no customer service !
unbelievable .
cheap , fast , friendly .
i ate here tonight with my husband and two kids .
really crappy service .
friend 's pancakes included several black hairs inside of the pancake .
the waitress sucked .
but this place has none !
get ur dam act together !
waitress : sausage or bacon ?
i will not go back there !
so gross !
.
will not be back .
i asked for cheese on my eggs and bacon extra crispy .
i 'm just going to pass on coming to this ihop for a while .
so i went to this location this morning for the first time .
not the best ihop i ever been to .
plus the pancakes were on a plate to small to eat off .
on her phone in her own little world looking for gold .
right by the entrance too !
will not be eating here anymore .
the reason they got _num_ stars was due to the bathroom .
ca n't imagine what happens when it 's busy .
i got off work early and dropped off my car at noon .
needless to say .
this facility and its owner , and employees .
is horrible .
pizza hut has gone down hill fast .
it 's very disappointing .
pizza and wings both cold .
we had _num_ pedicures and _num_ full sets .
what a waste !
i just recently went back last week to get a mani/pedi .
there was paint all over my skin on my toes .
she sat there watching tv .
this is not cool .
the manager walked in and almost bumped into my table .
the workers were n't at their best tonight .
girl forget to give me receipt .
trying to find a manager who could reverse the over charge was a pain .
finally over charge was corrected .
i called the companies corporate office in california .
he was _num_ months old .
this was extremely frustrating .
so i walked out .
is the veterinarian even looking at my dog ?
especially running a hour behind yup dont think she looked at him .
i was really annoyed .
i have been paying you all for the highest tier plan for my dog .
because that 's the only way you 'd make money .
they seem to care more about getting there money than they care about animals .
found item but cashier was busy talking to off duty staff person .
yet still no flavor .
c'mon , ben 's owners !
so i get my sandwich and bagels and head on home .
the wife had been craving bagels , we were excited .
, the quality is hit or miss .
very disappointing .
the food itself was fine ... typical red lobster fare .
nothing overly special .
_num_ days old crab legs .
never returning to this place again .
never again red lobster never again .
what a rip-off !
the service was terrible .
terrible experience .
our waitress stopped by about _num_ minute later with a serving of their biscuits .
lame !
this review strictly has to do with the `` endless shrimp '' experience .
it seems once again we are invisible , happened to us before here !
seems like we spent the whole afternoon on this server !
might just be this server but it happened to us before !
i wanted to get lobster as i 've tried it but never my own .
on a _num_ dollar meal that 's a pretty big screw up .
really bad food !
skip it .
worst experience ever !
how insulting ?
i would never stay here again .
so some people out there ate rat tortillas .
frozen yogurt is either vanilla or chocolate .
staff is slow .
pizza was not very good .
the service is slow .
the pizza is horrible .
take your money elsewhere !
i will not go again .
a child could have done better .
do not go to this bakery !
i stopped in with my _num_ young children for the first time .
the service is horrible .
what miserable people .
very disgusted .
this is my least favorite yarn shop .
no chili or cheese .
do n't eat here .
so they replaced it with a large fries .
dry burger with very little toppings .
Neutral
disgusting lunch .
threw the crap away .
not for family or dates .
horrible customer service !
so ca n't wait to get my washer and dryer for the house .
rude , dirty , disgusting .
Positive
i would !
so i did just that , reserved the car got the confirmation etc .
worst customer service ever !
are you kidding me ?
the employee had kept telling us the car would be there any minute .
i said okay , i 'll leave it .
skip this place .
went to this establishment once after it reopened .
the restaurant was busy but not packed .
once they reopened , this place was never the same .
i did n't feel very skeptical .
i ordered the sub , hubby ordered medium wings .
gross .
you would do far better even ordering from a chain .
this place is okay , but service seems to be hit or miss .
a crime to call this ny style pizza .
never going back .
this is not ny pizza !
both slices were thicker than your basic delivery chain pizza .
_num_ minutes late .
i will not be back .
just walked out .
recently had pizza and wings plus two drinks .
i ordered a basket of fries and a _num_ '' pepperoni pizza .
Negative
wasted $ _num_ .
they simply do not care .
it needs a serious cleaning on the patio , inside and the grill !
terrible conditions .
never saw a beverage cart .
better service there & better drinks .
wrong .
worst service possible .
i like other people stop by there on our way to work , work !
it horrible .
horrible new owner !
the manager was rude !
seriously i need to park and wait for a chicken biscuit .
it 's not worth it .
we all ordered the waffle fries and spicy chicken sandwich .
greasy dark fried strips .
it almost impossible to find someone on the floor to help you .
money aside , my main concern was my little girl .
yes , pills for a _num_ year old !
this place is ridiculous .
side he becomes urgent care doc .
not a good place to go !
bad experience altogether .
wo n't go back .
in the meantime we spent our own money to go to one .
horrible as usual !
it 's ridiculous .
i have went to this urgent care a few times in the past .
very unhappy with them .
i may change my rating then , but for now ... ew .
at pick up , he was friendly and helped me with my bags .
he did begin following directions provided to me , via text .
the driver said , glad one of us knew where they were going .
again not acceptable .
they recently had an ownership change and have doubled their rates .
uber car is now cheaper ( especially when you have two or more ) .
supposed to take _num_ minutes .
the clerk was helping some one order a coffee .
she would n't do it .
very disappointing .
as far as i could tell each customer was treated this way .
i 've experienced this on more then one occasion and witnessed it as well .
went there tonight - eat in - ordered a pepperoni & onion pizza .
first bite ... the crust was doughy and chewy and tasted strongly of flour .
never , ever , again .
we ordered a large with spinach , mushroom and anchovies .
a ten buck pizza for almost thirty .
i would recommend some training in customer service and product knowledge ... .
horrific customer service !
how rude !
bad planning .
hire some check out people please and staff appropriately !
had a horrible experience .
most horrible experience ever !
no big deal .
another awful experience !
i walked in and there were two women behind your return counter .

worst customer service ever .
rating this visit a _num_ star .
not this time .
half dead too .
so , we waited .
poor customer service .
spend more get better !
horrible .
failed to fully impress .
there is no excuse .
no complaints .
then , not thinking , i ordered fried ice cream .
the description says `` taco and ( beef or chicken ) cheese enchilada '' .
and the enchilada was beef , not cheese .
the $ _num_ house margarita was in a tiny ice filled glass .
have eaten here at least _num_ times a month for the last few years .
the room was cold .
the flour tortilla on my daughter 's bean burro was crunchy .
my family has been coming here for over _num_ years .
we will not be coming back .
sad ... .
big mistake , huge .
another huge mistake !
went tonight and ordered two shredded beef tacos .
_num_ ) giant oily , greasy spot on the bench seat .

they did however schedule _num_ people up front .
unacceptable harkins !
he would not go away .
think twice before you do business with arrowhead hd .
very disappointed !
i did n't experience this .
complete waste of time .
simply not worth it !
horrible !
i saw absolutely nothing `` special '' about anything .
not a lot to see and do .
not a place for adults .
staff however was welcoming .
will not be going back .
kids were bored .
extremely disappointed !
nothing worked except the elevator , the bathrooms , and the elevator music .
displays were in hallways and were dimly lit .
very disappointed .
very disappointed .
you can find better information on google .
so some background , i only come here because my mom does .
i do n't like her mood .
i have been a loyal customer for _num_ years .
unprofessional and rude .
_num_ times i called today trying to get a confirmation email .
i really do n't like this place .
overpriced and not good .

empty .
my husband and i went there for lunch today .
Positive
it 's not as appetizing as it sounds .
wasted _num_ $ !
i sat in the bar are for a late lunch .
we never got to sit down .
does anyone work at this red robin ?
i ended up ordering soda water and my boyfriend got dr. pepper .
needless to say we felt rushed .
ordered the bbq chicken sandwich last night .
what else is n't getting washed ?
you 'll get better service that way .
my party of _num_ arrived this afternoon around 4pm .
service was terrible .
this arrowhead location fell way short of the mark .
they lost our business !
however , i 'm huge on customer service .
disgusting .
one star is too much .
no fries .
service was horrible .
we walked in and the hostess was very friendly .
she seated us in a booth , as we requested .
we always go on a tuesday for the _num_ % off special .
orders were wrong .
just brought over the bill .
worst experience ever .
how rude .
it was wrong .
my salesman bill was very personable - i have to give him that .
so steve apparently worked his magic .
they tell me that they can not help me .
shame on this place !
this club was really creepy .
$ _num_ too much in my opinion .
website says one time , sign on office says another .
disappointing .
Negative
_num_ .
_num_ .
the cut counter had an express station to handle customers with smaller orders .
_num_ .
so difficult to find anything in this place .
ugh .
would rate _num_ stars if i could .
avoid midas !
it 's just not possible .
needless to say he arrived at 9am _num_ hours late .
no apology .
very very disappointing .
better to blow off said customer completely .
um no thanks .
seriously bad customer service .
horrible customer service .
worst service experience ever !
on top of that , they try pushing several other items on you .
i corrected him and let him know that i had an appointment .
when i called on the phone they claimed i could bring my car in .
terrible customer service !
i probably would still be sitting there !
_num_ stars for the price but that 's out of pity .
i took my car in june _num_ .
$ _num_ total .
$ _num_ total .
$ _num_ in savings .
his attitude changed real quick , professionalism went right out the door .
trust me .
the fries are always cold .
i understand people make mistakes , but this experience was brutal .
honestly i really do n't like this location .
she raised her voice telling me to hurry and chose my 3rd item .
he discounted the ticket _num_ % .
it was about 2-3 pm in the afternoon , not busy at all .
it was bad .
i now remember why i have n't been to an ihop in _num_ years .
we had horrible service !
oh well ... at least i left full .
the whole interior is decorated to look like some small italian village or something .
overcooked ?
i just was n't impressed .
food was not authentic .
calamari looks and tastes like french fries .
mentioned to our waitress that i thought my dinner was really small .
how pathetic is that ?
_num_ .
walked in at _num_ pm .
_num_ .
the calamari i guarantee is a very low end pre breaded frozen product .
_num_ .
daughter ordered a house salad with balsamic vinaigrette .
overly thick and odd taste .
_num_ .
_num_ .
we wiped off the silverware with our napkins and went on .
being from chicago , we dine on a lot on italian food .
the noodles tasted weird .
horrible !
it was bad !
i will not be returning .
she was quite rude .
it was overpowered by oregano .
it was really a bowl of chunky tomatoes seasoned with peppers and oregano .
my italian margarita was so so .
disappointing !
sauce was plain .
service was horrible .
i 'm trying not to gag as i write this .
... wrong !
it was awful !
i hardly ate .
awkward .
next time , we 'll wait for olive garden .
terrible service and food .
the waitress kept running off before you could ask for anything .
1st time visit and last time .
was n't very tasty .
the lady sitting next to him also ordered a caesar salad with grilled chicken .
the lady sitting across from me ordered the wedge salad .
i ordered the goat cheese strawberry salad with grilled chicken .
the chicken tasted as though it was frozen then boiled .
there were more complaints with other orders down the table as well .
horrible experience !
ok food with large portions .
service was terrible !
nothing to write home about .
place could use a cleaning .
waitress finally came running out probably thinking we skipped out .
service was bad .
real bad .
service was horrible !
waitress was unprofessional and unfriendly .
literally cut my mouth trying to eat it .
they need better quality .
we got italian dressing and baked potato soup .
i was very disappointed .
the manager angela could care less .
looked through previous reviews and thought we would try this restaurant out last night .
i was very disappointed .
i will not be back .
very disappointed .
not fresh at all .
tacky ?
but it just was n't good .
it 's crap .
if you want food without flavor , this is your place .
it 's just dead .
no such luck .
after halfway through the salad we realize some thing is off .
there is no cheese .
now , my husband and i have very different taste buds .
the layout of this location is insane .
not impressed by the food .
atmosphere is crowded .
gross !
the antipasto salad was awesome .
the chicken was really good , the pasta and garlic bread were very so-so .
went earlier this evening with _num_ people who have never been .
otherwise , poor service !
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
too late .
that taste drowned out everything else .
i was very disappointed .
the menu was typical .
we had to ask three times for boxes to put our leftovers in .
the bowl was to feed _num_ yet you get _num_ sausage 's , huh !
maybe the other locations are better ?
i could go on , but you get the point .
too bad .
we ordered the rigatoni with meat sauce and spicy sausage with ricotta .
that was seamless as there were plenty of reservations available .
horrible .
the meatballs was horrific .
terrible .
the waiter served our $ _num_ salad on hot plates .
will not be back .
this was my second visit to this location .
only the garlic butter on my bread .
the co-workers were good to each other but not into the customers .
very disappointing !
waited _num_ more mins for food .
baked ziti was dry and crispy .
two of the tables next to us ended up having problems with their bill .
in comparison to olive garden i would say it 's about the same .
make sure you are not in a hurry .
not my favorite italian place .
not thrilled at all .
just sauce and noodles .
dirty and horrible service .
very forced service .
the worst food ever .
Very negative
next the waiter brought our check minus the change , ?
family style is not so family .
ok , i 've never been a fan of this place .
i came here tonight for my brother in laws birthday .
olive garden , overall , is way better .
she intended on visiting the restaurant and making sure things were being done right .
experience for the sake of a free meal , and she understood .
nothing .
too bad .
very disappointed !
it seems like they forgot our original order .
horrible service .
i was so excited to finally go back to buca for pizza .
Negative
i left so unhappy !
had to get our own oil and vinegar .
stuffy , old and out dated decor .
also out of our favorite dessert !
sounds great i thought .
wrong !
today , another really long wait time .
incredibly rude !
she shoulders over to another co-worker to get advice .
`` i 'm sorry .
my mom and i went to this location for a morning smoothie .
just like any other jamba juice location .
stop posting groupons or honor them , bell location !
service - staff was very friendly and knowledgeable .
greeted us when we walked in even though the place was packed .
but found an open table ... that was cleared but not wiped off .
but service sucks .
i wish i had better things to say .
the food was descent especially the pretzel bites !
staff needs a little bit more customer service training .
music way too loud .
look , let 's face it , maggie moo .
m & m 's and sprinkles ?
`` is that all for you , sir ? ''
not to your manager or anything .
begging them back .
this one event will probably deter me from ice cream all together .
low class employees .
they do n't care .
i could careless .
this store needs better management and new employees .
my credit card continued being billed .
this store really needs to work on customer service .
she showed me where the hair spray was that i wanted .
they should give their help a better training program .
completely rude !
complete rude .
the food is alright , it 's denny 's .
she deserves to be fire for service like that .
the only smile i got while there was from my waitress .
all the employees were behind the counter talking and joking .
very disappointing .
stopped in by myself mid morning for a quick breakfast .
wo n't go back .
holy crap !
the portions were extremely small to begin with .
they were not organized .
i would highly recommend texas roadhouse for anyone who wants good bbq .
literally sat _num_ people in an area they would normally sit _num_ people .
she told me busy night .
there is no excuse !
the service was horrible .
i had to get up twice for refills and walk over to the bar .
i do n't personally like it but my husband likes going here for steak .
the waitress listed _num_ toppings , without breaking .
i was given a sweet potato with _num_ unnecessary toppings .
outback , black angus quality .
gross lettuce .
not knowing or caring that the best days are behind him now .
the other _num_ party guests sat at another table across from us .
never again , will i step foot in this location .
management is rude and unprofessional .
my fiance and i stopped here for lunch this last weekend .
knowing what i know , i should know better .
ribs were actually dry .
they were tender just dry .
baked potato was old .
ribs were not heated through .
make sure the chicken is cooked !
nothing to write home about .
gross !
not to mention there is a three drink maximum !
far cry from the awesome steaks just across the parking lot at firebirds .
waited too long for water on a hot as heck day .
salads were just ok .
very disappointed .
very cold .
restaurant was not full .
this place had better wake up before they lose all their customers .
i will not be back !
super disappointed tonight .
total wait time _num_ min !
still not impressed with texas roadhouse .
food was not cooked correctly again .
so now we are waiting for our main dishes with hopes of better service .
my child 's chicken strips came out without the fries .
place is going down hill .
would n't recommend it .
we were greeted .
they were horrible .
we love this place !
seriously rude employees .
not sweet at all really .
it was also bland .
so here i am left to enjoy a lettuce and blue cheese salad ?
horrible .
that was sooo worth $ _num_ .
gave em a _num_ since they serve coke instead of pepsi .
a short while after i started eating , i began to not feel well .
not as good as i remember .
my first bad experience .
too much dry maybe old herbs .
but was n't .
f for service .
first off , the entrance to the place .
salad is suppose to be healthy .
_num_ $ for two people to eat lunch ... really ... for a buffet ?
so the food .
not a good start .
i continued on to the soup .
bland and flavorless .
( i mean , how do you screw up a potato ? )
this place is off my list for good .
low quality salad .
bland tasteless flavors .
they only safe heaven are the waiters .
not good .
after getting new glasses , it was off to the soda machine .
ugh .
that was just too much .
nothing more needs to be said .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i could n't even drink it .
then we had to wait awhile to get our drinks refilled .
it just was n't a good experience .
they are obviously trying to increase the stars for this restaurant .
she simply stood behind her station and looked at us .
obviously , i will not return .
he had _num_ legs on his crab .
the shrimp was dry and over-cooked .
then we waited another _num_ min .
she returned as we were finishing our meal .
no apologies for our waiting .
the restaurant was less than half full .
knew there was a reason that olive garden sold this brand off .
just going to have to find a new favorite seafood restaurant , any suggestions ?
it was so disappointing !
one other thing : the high speed internet is not , not , not !
the pool was nice as well as the pool area itself .
disgusting !
are you freakin kidding me ?
no hospitality .
unacceptable !
do not stay at this place !
cleanliness is another issue as this hotel is very pet friendly .
parking was horrible .
however , we ended up going to their other location .
not really a sushi place .
they are the kings of spicy imitation crab .
my grandma has trouble standing and getting up and down .
pricey and boring .
this was not .
the rest of it was eh .
this time it was was such a let down .
no tricks no nothing .

getting annoyed .
terrible service .
gross !
horrible service .
finally ate around _num_ .
where to begin ?
second time i been here , i pulled hair out of my mouth .
staff poorly dressed .
put them away until needed .
owners and managers need to read these posts and do something about it .
you can easily train the staff to refuse service to those not dressed properly .
it just was n't a great experience .
tastes like ass service is also ass .
this looks like an old ass best buy .
first review ever .
she apologized and walked away .
we 've made reservations for _num_ o'clock .
did n't get in til _num_ .
horrible service .
roaches in bath room .
the price you pay for the amount of food you get is laughable .
tried this location expecting it to be like the happy valley location .
not if you 're a single parent for the night .
never had an issue at the gilbert location .
avoid like the plague .
overpriced and misleading .
treats tenants very badly .
ridiculous !
not a nice atmosphere here .
neighbors are rude !
safeway and frys have much nicer people and better prices .
their meat department is completely inept and shady .
this grocery store has questionable food handling practices .
i handed the jeweler my watch and new band .
but i really dont have much to say about it .
we will not be going back .
food was not good at all .
they are not italian .
i 'm so disappointed .
no provolone .
the sub was disappointing .
disgusting .
i was so disappointed .
i did n't even finish the sub .
so not recommended ... blech .
the wings were so small , we really felt let down .
i wish it was better .
disgusting !
not acceptable !
no more .
i do know the gentleman in front of me did wait quiet awhile though .
no stars !
and of course they have all these `` issues '' .
can i get some fries ?
extremely rude employees .
if your store is closed , lock the doors and put up a sign .
so $ _num_ for a sandwich ?
sad experience .

worst gel manicure ever !
worst nail salon ever .
the service is horrible .
such a shame .
horrible customer service .
impatient and extremely rude !
very disappointed .

they were n't that good .
i just sat and looked at mine .
i 'd never go back .
poor food .
poor service .
no stars !
not a good start .
there are many better choices .
i put in the search for vegetarian and firebirds came up .
service was good .
went for a business lunch and expected much more from their food .
she ordered two entrees and i ordered a salad $ _num_ .
no thanks !
what a shame !
so i ordered a salad with chicken .
overall , not really impressed .
i get one night a week to go out with my wife .
did i say disgusting ?
very poor experience .
a couple walked in the door and were immediately seated .
one side was a bench with _num_ chairs on the other side .
horrible .
i got the cilantro chicken breast with mashed potatoes .
there is a serious communication problem between servers and cooks at this place .
would not visit again .
`` steakhouse '' .
do n't bother .
i wish i had taken pictures but actually forgot .
now , the crab cakes were good .
i 'm convinced winter visitors keep them in business .
overcooked .
completely flavorless .
i have gluten allergies as well so am limited to what i can have .
i really hate that .
but the staff is what really makes this location a _num_ star joint .
on this particular day , i visited the bell location .
he did n't even greet me .
not even a smile .
now , that i have , i added that review for this store .
but , like other chains , it may also be the store specifically .
i was wrong .
are you kidding me ?
later i found out that this employee was a manager named daniel .
i walk in to this location to grab some lunch with my husband .
as if that was a huge problem for her .
had rubios catered to my office today .
the churros , brownies , chips and salsa made up for the rest .
it was $ _num_ .
thanks to a fellow yelper , i found my old doctor .
the food is terribly mediocre .
lunch is always busy , and service ( up to now ) was so-so .
i hate the atmosphere .
i hate the noise !
bizarre !
my boyfriend has wanted to take me to this restaurant for _num_ years .
nothing special .
gross !

breakfast was just okay .
weird bowl of fruit though .
we ordered quickly as there was a plane to catch .
i said , are you kidding me ?
the waiter came to our table and offered us waters and bread .
we spent over $ _num_ on our lunch .
sourdough is alright too .
it 's so thick and , i 'm sure , soaked in egg .
it was not appetizing to me .
the eggs were fine and maybe had a little seasoning to them .
the bacon was really dark red in color and very crispy .
the vanilla bean tasted a lot like vanilla ice cream .
do n't be fooled by the fancy exterior i would much rather stay home .
absolutely crap service !
seriously f -- - the cheesecake factory .
the meatloaf was a dense , old , brick like piece of meat .
food is totally mediocre .
hate chains .
horrible service !
are original waiter had to go because he had his lunch break .
low class location stay away .
my husband is allergic to carrots and informed the waitress .
when it arrived , they had replaced the asparagus ... with carrots .
this was n't a deal breaker for me .
i was just extremely dissapointed by the customer service .
this place is terrible .
awful beer selection .
seriously the only guests were our friends .
our _num_ year old chose it for her reward dinner .
the bowl of rice and veggies is kind of hard to screw up .
bartender was friendly and accommodating and order came out quickly .
food was mediocre .
the menu clearly states _num_ percent for a party of _num_ or more .
someone is in need of some training ; the manager and the waiter .
she is on a low protein diet .
probably but maybe just for lunch to get a sandwich .
disappointed .
and were deeply disappointed .
not a single person acknowledged me .
this was average at best .
eh , okay but not great .
humongous menu and food seemed pretty hit and miss .
what a disappointment .
so , tasteless .
i do like the decor though .
regardless , there are definitely better restaurants on bell blvd .
got lettuce wraps , orange chicken , and soba noodles .
next time will just go to pa change next door .
after posting this review i received an email from management requesting for further feedback .
again , she was very polite & professional .
also small portions compared to picture advertised on their special menu .
very disappointed .
very disappointing .
i guess just in case ; ( .
decided to give the elephant bar a try despite the reviews .
i ordered the blackened mahi mahi with mango salsa .
terribly disappointed .
all side items ala cart .
service was below standards .
terrible service .
or chicken nuggets instead of nicely sliced chicken ?
it was horrible .
we left disappointed .
sadly they were not .
hooters = stupid crappy place .
chicks are stupid .
totally disorganized staff .
i really hate their food .
everything is disgusting .
the wings , the shrimp , the oysters , everything .

my mom even had several items in her hand and put them back .
the bbb is next on my list .
crooked .
i looked at the deal again and couldnt see anything different .
so i signed the papers and went on my way .
Neutral
i explained that i couldnt leave because my car was in the service department .
my advice : stay as far away from larry miller dodge as possible .
these guys are less than reputable and i 'd advise anyone to steer clear .
unbelievable .
my suv was due for its oil change so i get it done .
one oil change and tire rotation took two hours .
bad idea !
avoid at all costs .
said work was done and charged me but the work was never done .
i had to take my car to service as i purchased an extended warranty .
buzz off lame dealership .
and i have the hard hit on my credit report to prove it .

the waiter eventually ventured over and asked for our drinks .
my companions food , chicken quesadillas came out looking very pretty .
my chorizo stuffed chicken medallions ; far less so .

ummm , no .
i set up an appointment _num_ days out for 1pm .
i was very disappointed .
nothing like good chicago pizza .
the rest of it , we cracked apart and fed to the birds .
the sauce was tasty and there was just enough of it .
all toppings were abundant , except the sausage .
no coke .
this is not chicago style anything .
complete garbage .
the italian beef sandwich was well seasoned , and sliced thin .
they deserve zero stars .
unbelievable .
no flavor .
we ordered a mushroom , sausage pizza saturday night .
i think frozen pizza or even peter piper pizza is better than this .
chicago style pizza ?
this was more like az pizza .
i am now online ordering a sicilian from nypd .
wo n't be back .
i printed the order confirmation everything showed exactly as i ordered it .
my fault .
so i went in a few weeks later to use mine .
everything else is pretty standard for target .

not only that , they continue to promise me week after weeks without results .
_num_ .
worst stay in years .
staff is very unprofessional .
try the comfort inn just down the road .
avoid at all costs !
thin walls .
i would n't stay here again .
!
one tire was reading _num_ lbs and the other at _num_ lbs !

worst denny 's ever .
to add salt to wound , they used american sliced cheese it !
my boyfriend 's chicken wrap was made with very hard tortilla .

it 's only a thursday morning after a breakfast rush .
bad , stay away !
i mean extremely loud .
the staff was not great .
cheap beer .
staff is not very friendly .
not the kind of folks that make it easy to do business with .
driver asked for _num_ $ more than was quoted by aaa !
apparently the new owner has trouble keeping employees .
horrible service & mediocre food .
kind of a plain , simple setting .
i will not be back .
bad service.
please do n't forget , service starts within your restaurant .
worst .
we could not eat it .
it is by far the cheapest motel in the town .
i will say this .
only place there was to stay due to snow storm .
no ice machine .
uncomfortable , noisy beds .
not impressed .
do not , do not use the pharmacy !
apparently the party of _num_ that ordered ahead of us completely overwhelmed them .
_num_ .
too bad .
stopped for lunch .
i think this is the most expensive in wickenburg for breakfast .
food was bland .
service was slow .
for some reason , one always has to wait to get a table here .
whoever owns this place is seeing money slip across the street .
terrible place .
worse place ever .
we ate here on the suggestion of the desk clerk where we were staying .
i wish wickenburg had more to offer .
being calorie conscious , i said yes .
obviously a mistake !
terrible business practice !
i however did like their taco , beef was reasonable seasoned .
now after sharing this plate i was drinking water .
i think they are cooking them in too low of a temperature oil .
nothing to rave about .
worth the money i guess .
i had the mexican pizza which was very large and ok.
their combinations stink - people do n't just eat enchilada 's !
rolled tacos are called taquitos .
the bathrooms are small and smell like mildew .
horse pictures - is old west , not mexican .
american / mexican restaurant - maybe .
take your outside decorations inside , call restaurant impossible ... you need help !
bland beyond belief .
hot sauce was mild , ok the chips were good .
disappointing food was very horrible !
not impressed in the least .
very very bland .
very disappointed .
why have chili if it 's not hot .
my boyfriend and i were passing through town and stopped for lunch here .
needless to say if you 're looking for good mexican food .
stopped here with my husband on our way back from vegas with high hopes .
my husband ordered a bean burrito with cheese and i had the bean dip .
hours posted on yelp stated they were open until 9:00 pm .
this place really is the same as others in this town .
rice and beans were ok .
wife got the rolled tacos , again boiled chicken shredded .
very disappointing .
struggled to get the bill and was darn tempted to simply leave .
chips and salsa were average , had nachos as an appetizer and stopped there .
when i drove by the other hotels in taxi , they sure looked better .
cute exterior but this is a motel , not a hotel .
i 've stopped here a few times on my way to vegas .
the biscuit like my wife 's was pretty dense .
just under _num_ bucks for our two items and coffee .
ugh !
the bathroom was gross .
just all around horrible .
the other waitress told us to sit down she would wait on us .
disgusting .
who ever thinks they are good can get better at burger king and cheaper .
Negative
we stopped for lunch on the drive from phoenix to las vegas .
they were not even nuggets .
the onion rings were good and the chili was just okay .
not cool .
the burgers were pretty tasty and the fries were good .
horrible !
would not recommend .
given the quality of the food , it was ridiculously overpriced .
the wine list also seemed very pricey .
even outback looks like a five star restaurant compared to this place .
almost everything was in the $ _num_ dollar range .
our bill was $ _num_ .
plus not including tip .
i was very disappointed .
what a complete disappointment .
this place is not for foodies !
every menu item has some weird twist to it ( ex .
food was nothing special .
we ordered a shrimp scampi and _num_ cheeseburgers .
veggies were not cooked .
every time i visit i 've had some type of issue .
their quality for a bacon egg and cheese biscuit is very low .
Negative
they never get your order right .
no one .
i am going to yell now , ready ?
horrible !
one example : i ordered a cone a diet coke and _num_ coffee .
they give me _num_ coffee .
cashier had no personality .
terrible !
based off off this experience , i see why they are rated _num_ starts .
based off off this experience , i see why they are rated _num_ starts .
and i 've been to some very sketchy places !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
umm , wtf gross !
seriously , it 's not rocket science .
ridiculous .
i 've been here several times and every time i have problems .
you will get attitude every time you call for something .
i hate this place so much .
constant issues with things in the apartment breaking .
he 'll also let him dump water on your belongings .
no `` sorry '' .
nothing is being done about this at the moment .
never got em .
rather boring .
no excitement .
i went to the deli to get some chicken .
but because i have n't yelped in a while , i decided to entertain .
`` oh , it has a hole in it ?
the morning staff seems more upbeat than the folks who work evening or afternoon .
i think our neighborhood deserves a nicer supermarket with friendly and professional employees .
ugh .
horrible store !
the customer service at this store is deplorable .
sometimes they may have _num_ cashiers open , but the lines are still long .
another is the bartender assigned to make drinks for the wedding .
the bartender was helpful in trying to accommodate me with something to drink .
she was looking down on me and my social class .
if asking them to put me to sleep is asking too much .
where you can taste the grease as you bite it .
oh i miss my old china a go go on ann and decatur .
shame .
not surprised , who would be busy with food like that ?
i wish it was better .
Neutral
worst chinese food ever !
i ordered the crispy orange beef and hubby ordered the twice cooked chicken .
no bueno .
the eggrolls were filled with cheap veggies .
that took _num_ minutes .
Positive
lousy service .
fries were cold .
server never asked about refills for drinks .
ridiculous .
i ordered the rosemary chicken with baby potatoes and broccoli .
why , oh why , do we ever end up here ?
but come on , it was i swear like _num_ degrees inside !
i think you should just stick to frozen food !
i walked in and noticed a cashier counting money from the cash register .
disgusting .
it certainly is not `` woohoo !
such a pity !
the annual pie sale _num_ in february will probably find me there again !
gross !
made me lose my appetite .
are you kidding me ?
went to the one on stephanie .
no greeting at door .
will not be going back .
slow , unfriendly service .
weak .
it was inconvenient and embarrassing to be treated this way .
went for lunch on sunday .
we walked out .
all the manager could do was laugh at my questions .
i ordered the chicken pot pie with side ceasar salad .
pie were good as expected .
accompanied by a long black hair .
a little effort goes a long way .
bad attitudes .
i will just stick to pizza hut when in town and recommend the same .
they tend to skimp on toppings here though especially the veggies .
i get mixed results every time .
no consistency here .
very sad .
at exactly one hour , i called the store and spoke to jose .
but tonight 's delivery literally made me lose my appetite .
i was ordering multiple items for an occasion with a total of $ _num_ .
so , tonight 's food was really under par .
Positive
the delivery driver was nice not a problem .
he just stood there staring at me .
i had been here before about a year ago and everything was fine .
i was glad to grab an appointment , and arrived early .
i will not be back .
not so nice after all .
been going there for _num_ year .
they are not a clean establishment !
will only return for fill .
especially since there is _num_ nail shops on every corner .
a dentist office is very intimidating to me .
i called for a cleaning _num_ days prior to my holiday trip .
horrible experience .
hell no .
hell no .
hell no ... .
never explained or talked to me at all .
the worst experience ever !
the x-ray tech took routine x-rays until my husband informed her of his pain .
this place is crap .
worst doctor ever .
not personable or friendly .
they dont even deserve _num_ star .
are you kidding me ?
this a dentist office not a makeup counter at the mall .
there are so many more offices around this area .
not worth going back again .
this office is incredibly inept .
so painful !
no thanks !
first the dentist i saw has the bed side manners of a zombie .
last year this dentist and office staff was the best id have ever seen .
i went _num_ months ago for a routine cleaning .
been there about _num_ times .
this review is a long time coming .
excuse me ?
this place does n't deserve one star !
rude dr. money hungry .
this place will lose patients because how mean the dr is .
you guys deserve better treatment .
i do n't like their attitude .
watch out people because this establishment fails to give you the proper care !
beware of this dentist !
the apartments are large , and there are windows in every room .
tenants get a covered parking space and there is guest parking .
_num_ barber .
Negative
_num_ hours to fill birth control ... .
so nothing could be done with it .
not awesome .
they do already have _num_ lanes .
i 've used minute clinic before .
i use this cvs all the time .
my drs office called some of my prescriptions in and gave me written .
you should teach your employees customer service .
look in my file see all the money i give you per month .
i was excited , my visit would be short .
what the hell ?
rude lady .
not as good as everyone says it is .
where have all the good chinese restaurants gone ?
gross .
i will never be going back .
it comes with egg drop soup and some wonton chips ( dine-in only ) .
if i ever decide to return , i will update accordingly .
not a word to the little girl !
this food was not good .
very disappointing .
just not good .
fast forward _num_ years to henderson .
used to eat here years ago and it was much better .
bbq pork fried rice had an off taste .
beef ( from beef and broccoli ) was chewy .
gross !
terrible delivery service .
same non english speaking driver and a repeat performance .
i live _num_ blocks from the restaurant .
wow been going to this place for years and tonight just blew me away .
i did n't even eat it .
when i have so little personal time already .
this is not my problem !
search elsewhere !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
maintenance is ok ... if they ever get stuff done .
_num_ .
communication is the worst .
_num_ .
_num_ .
and slow !
just was n't a fan .
just go across the street to albertsons or a few blocks down to walmart .
the pharmacy , however , never seems to have anything in stock .
since i switched i have never had any problems with my meds .
wrong !
unbelievable .
dog crap everywhere .
whatever you do do n't live here .
i would not recommend living here .
i would like to add that the maintenance staff was always super friendly .
way too late to give _num_ days notice .
i would rate a _num_ .
i walked in and was looked at but never acknowledged .
grabbed my _num_ year old that desperately needed haircut .
it looks terrible !
my _num_ year old nephew could do a better job !
i walked in and asked how much it would be to ship an item .
they said it would be done by _num_ .
fortunately i found village east cleaners just down the road and they saved me .
my son asked for a certain haircut .
worse haircut experience ever !
she even gave my son a bald spot about an inches long .
she just could n't it done .
more like `` not so great clips '' !
so i go and grab my mom , so she could explain .
i will not be back !
really not good .
garlic knots were good , soft and buttery ... yum .
small local business that makes greasy thin crust pizza that is really tasty .
terrible customer service !
we have been loyal customers to this pizza joint for years until today .
so we decided to go that route and ordered pizza around 5:30 pm tonight .
the grub hub number is busy .
i chose this place because it had _num_ stars .
the pizza was cold .
he was extremely rude .
we had to do the referrals three times before they got it right .
forget getting prescriptions refilled without a required doctor visit so they can get $ .
not worth the headache .
so i closed both accounts and went to tan las vegas on eastern .
dump this place and get over to tan las vegas quick .
first you have to walk thru a smoke infested casino .
it 's not been updated or cleaned since the casino was opened .
_num_ .
so we had to pack all our belongings and move _num_ floors down .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the first time i 've ever been here was just for the buffet .
eh , yea , i 'm sure it was back in the days !
it was mediocre .
they also never explained what the room charges were .
eh , like i mentioned before , this was a bust .
such a disappointment .
horrible food .
really dreadful .
( that is number two as in poop ) .
short walk across the street to shopping .
and for the adventurous , a long walk down the street to costco .
it was totally disappointing .
it was sloppy and dirty .
this was a diet freakin pepsi !
with the people in charge of this casino making policies like that you wonder .
not here at the sunset .
( my fiancee and i stayed here _num_ 1/2 weeks ago .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
while the room was spacious , the housekeeping was suspect .
i remember breakfast buffets that cheap .
this hotel is the least customer service friendly place i have ever stayed in !
please tell your employees they are not actually doing the guest any favors .
it has no theme .
no personality at all .
i have not stayed at this hotel before .
the bath is the thing that holds the rating down .
no hot water .
these days even the low market rooms have them .
what gets me is that $ _num_ resort fee added to your daily bill .
why not just put it in the overall rate ?
the rooms are cheap , but at what cost !
overall , the employees there were super nice .
i got the open turkey sandwhich .
his face fell , but hey , do n't assume what i want .
after tasting it , i handed it back and asked for a sprite .
our mashed potatoes were grey .
the vegetables were cold .
not cool , cold .
is there cameras in the hallways ?
so we ate elsewhere .
i took my daughter for the buy _num_ get _num_ free buffet .
bad move !
all the chairs were taken .
both times they said they would `` investigate '' and get back to me .
i requested to speak with a manager but none was available .
i used to live in vegas and this has always been a locals casino .
it 's cheap , but far away from the vegas you are looking for .
the feast buffet was on par with a high school cafeteria .
but the hotel stinks .
stop letting people smoke in non-smoking rooms .
and if they do , then fix the damn problem .
unacceptable .
thank goodness it 's only one night .
dry gross and gross .
however , this is an old persons hotel/casino catering to smokers .
also not very family friendly .
the room rates were higher then the advertised value rates .
additionally , very low water pressure in the shower .
worst hotel near vegas !
most slot machines are tight .
you know you are hosting several teams with _num_ plus families per team .
that is the only activity at the hotel that is free of charge .
went to the oyster bar tonight .
ordered drinks and never recieved refill service on waters or soda .
people dont care , all seemed like they rather be some where else .
avoid .
spent our week vacation trying to call and take care of charges !
this place is ridiculous .
they have _num_ receptionists .
maybe that 's why it 's like this .
is n't usually wifi free ?
no not here .
mexican restaurant _num_ of _num_ stars .
this place is over priced .
there security are a bunch of douche bags .
then the waitresses walk past you like you 're invisible .
if i could give _num_ i would .
go to south point where they actually appreciate players .
bathrooms really need an update .
shower is so week and out of date .
shame .
i said it 's not a problem and went on my way .
even after i told her what happens the night before .
very unprofessional sunset station .
spread the word and beware lv .
or , do you have that many complaints to handle ?
i suggest locals and visitors alike visit all other casinos then station casinos .
stopped at the pool bar before even sitting down .
will finish stay but not again .
the room is dirty .
monday , no call .
it was such a hassle for such a small thing .
on the way to my apt , i received a confirmation for our apt .
i purchased my bmw from desert bmw of henderson .
no thanks !
can not talk about other salesmen there though .
both previous visits my vehicle was out for 5+ days for minor work .
so not professional !
blah blah blah .
it stinks .
boy was i wrong !
after purchasing the vehicle , the car had _num_ key .
talk about bad business !
and than a month later my brand new car broke down .
again to horrible service .
my experience today has led me to this vent session !
i will not be back and will not recommend .
i 'm so disappointed !
so rude .
do not buy your car here !
so in total this is taking _num_ hours out of my saturday .
that does no good .
i feel like they sold me a lemon .
i returned to bmw to have them complete these repairs .
my car seat was never fully repaired on my purchase date as promised .
promises to call me back and nothing !
two months later check engine light comes on .
so the new lady ( service advisor ) said let me call you back .
bmw henderson not recommended !
this is my 3rd time dealing with simple routine maintenance on my car .
i tried again , and same thing .
it should be ready in a couple of hours he says .
nothing , other than it was clean and the people were nice .
consistently horrible service .
routine horrible service .
ca n't do it .
was the first one here this morning to get a car wash .
now there gon na try to get someone to do it for me .
and it was just ok .
i 've had my bmw for _num_ years .
that is why i took my business to bmw of las vegas !
they said the car is more expensive and you must pay more for it .
of course i will send my complain to the bmw head office as well .
very short and cold in her demeanor .
she didnt seem to care at all .
1st problem - wife had a mole removed .
i say ok , i will check with them .
so , i go back to the office for another shot .
what a disaster .
for this expertise i was billed $ _num_ .
what a rip-off .
obviously wont be going back !
terrible !
so disappointed and so unprofessional !
will never go back and will never recommend !
this is seriously unacceptable !
not in henderson location .
i was however , able to schedule an appointment with another dermatologist .
huh ?
my main doctor put in a referral with this office .
the prescriptions did help my skin , which was awesome .
they are money driven practice and not patient care .
do n't feed me bullshit .
well we went here instead of sunset station buffet .
it used to be better .
the chicken skewers were decent .
same with the broccoli beef and orange and sesame chicken .
as it was , i was there for _num_ .
i do n't typically write reviews but this needs to be said .
what a nightmare .
was in and out in about _num_ hours and the facilities were clean .
are you kidding me ?
nope , umc just sucks .
i can barely walk .
i 'm from boston and healthcare in this city is shocking .
still , three hour wait , for thirty seconds .
what they 're forgot at the bottom is anyone with money .
terrible service !

she was rude and unhelpful .
poor , poor customer service !
in the waiting room for _num_ hours with a _num_ year old .

i spent a lot of money and had some major work done .
there was _num_ people behind me .
i needed _num_ balloons for an event at my church .
the even was tuesday and i went in monday afternoon to get the balloons .
because of this , i said forget the balloons .
terrible .
this is the fast food of framing , without the fast food pricing .
staff is not knowledgable and unapologetic .
they charge you for drink refills , they charge you for togo containers .
make your place upscale , then maybe put a sign up like that !
it is as one reviewer stated like an old factory break room .
cornbread average , catfish ok .
rude !
ill never go back there again !
this was the first place i went to look for my wedding dress .
she made all of us feel like we were an inconvenience to her .

_num_ .
i 'm a bride and i have bride shit to do .

it makes your butt look perfect . ''
hoping it will sink into their heads and i can ring the bell .

i was pretty disappointed .
i did give this chain another chance after looking at dresses online .
not returning again .
what a nightmare !
ugh .
terrible service .
so unhappy .
so disappointed .
she tried her best though .
she did run to get us a bridesmaid dress .
that is annoying .
terrible !
so how did that happen -- the process was so overwhelming !
so i returned the dress .
in customer service .
there that she put back on the rack .
it also needs alterations .
my first experience was going into the store looking for my wedding gown .
well i was wrong !
do n't use david 's bridal .
poor communication .
rude .
how inappropriate and rude .
when i asked questions she acted like i was just being a pain .
she also printed out my favorites and brought them for me .
the alteration fees were enormous .
the employees are very pushy .
this place is horrible !
no thank you .
my experience was awful .
i will not be going back .
they seem to have more clothing than actual sporting equipment .
not a fan .
we were seated really quickly to a booth and then our waitress came over .
he ordered chicken alfredo , i ordered chicken parm .
i 'm giving this _num_ stars .
_num_ for the service .
the chicken sandwich was just a chicken sandwich .
nothing special .
my friend had the spaghetti bolognese .
but this was too much !
wrong !
all he said was , `` you guys want some calamari ?
he brought out one cold little bread loaf for the _num_ of us .
not good .
just a mess .
so - so .
this place is horrible !
stuffed mushrooms a little too peppery .
what stood out in particular was the mama 's trio .
this includes lasagna , chicken parmesan , and chicken cannelloni .
this place is terrible .
dreadful !
dreadful .
we will not be back .
the portions were good enough but it was short of amazing .
personally , i liked the pasta it was descent .
from then , i knew i wouldnt come back here again .
not anymore .
disappointed too many times .
horrible service !
never again will i spend another dollar there .
my husband and i went in for lunch .
beware , slow sat .
the only couple things that were good were the tea and the bread .
two of us tried the butter squash tortellini .

gross !
the service was alright , i 've had better .
we did n't even get dessert .
it stinks .
flavorless and dry .
just did n't make the grade .
will not be back .
boyfriend and i stopped by for dinner .
and he only had _num_ small tables .
_num_ stars is being overly kind .
$ _num_ wasted .
never again ... .
went to lunch last week with my boyfriend .
the hostess was clueless .
the girl stepped aside and we walked up to the hostess desk .
after a bit more confusion , we were taken to our table .
anyway , after that our meals came out rather quickly .
my dad really raved about the mushroom ravioli .
so maybe take-out would be a better option .
this place is so loud .
this place used to easily be ok , but now , not so much .
i could not eat it .
terrible , terrible , terrible .
the calamari is _num_ .
so disappointing .
when we finally received our food , the disappoint again was real .
my friends pasta was so much better though .
fettuccine alfredo with bell peppers and shrimp .
Neutral
new menu , smaller portions same price .
pasta was completely dry with chunks of spinach or whatever it was .
_num_ dollars wasted .
what a terrible experience .
oh wait , that 's exactly what it was .
not comforting .
my friends tomato basil was literally marinara sauce .
my friend could n't eat one bite .
after buying my house over a year ago in this neighborhood .
meatballs did not taste good .
poor beer selection .
then had to wait for cheese for the entree .
i was given my sub with hard bread and olives and pickles on it .
needless to say i 'll never go back .
thank goodness it 's not the one by my house .
absolutely terrible business !
the set is not working .
nightmare !
she cut quite a bit of hair off .
she gave me the slightest trim .
horrible service .
complete waste of time .
horrible service !
only one stylist was there as they had only opened an hour before .
i only got a cut so she sprayed my hair to wet it .
it looks terrible .
i was so disappointed .
i explained everything and was contacted by the district manager .
she should stick to washing hair and being the receptionist .
so disappointed .
the bathrooms are so-so .
very slow .
poor response from waitress .
steak overcooked .
the host then grabbed _num_ menus and told me to follow him .
the service is terrible !
are you kidding me ?
why did n't they throw it out !
we will not be back !
( strike _num_ ) .
i was so disgusted !
she put in a glass of cabernet and burger sliders which we never ordered .
the situation could 've been turned around .
you owe me some bacon that i paid for .
the service was terrible .
she only delivered our initial drink order and a water refill .

i ordered it anyways as a veg patty with cheddar , lettuce and tomato .
i was very disappointed .

_num_ drinks .
steamed broccoli was cold .
it was just horrible .
the server was somewhat alright .
slow slow and slower !
my party and i ate here for the _num_ for twenty deal .
never refilled our waters .
does anyone just get served in a timely manner ?
we ate the meatballs and showed the bread to the bartender .
hey kitchen staff , how about some quality control ?
that too took forever .
our only applebee 's near work .
both times !
my youngest daughter ordered pizza & the side was yogurt .
husband ordered online to go .
husband had rib tips which were average .
will not be returning .

several saw me and passed by yet none stopped to ask about my order .
i will not be returning .
seriously ?
will not go back .

will not go back .
poor service .
i like applebee 's but i 'll go to a different location next time .
needless to say be careful here .
trader joe 's is a staple stop on our weekly grocery route .
we have stopped buying many of the meats here .
lines here are so long .
the manager brad sometimes just seems not present .
wait for my order and see _num_ younger guys working .
if i had another car , i 'd never take it back there again !
big mistake .
i waited 30+ minutes .
slow .
rude employees .
management completely non responsive .
i felt bad .
horrible experience .
arguing went back and forth .
he said , and i quote , `` guys do n't wear jewelry '' .
_num_ .
_num_ .

he could have provided me the owner 's contact info .
he could have just taken car of my window tint scratches !

there are plenty of friendlier car washes in the vegas valley !
they kept trying to get me to do it again .
glad i took out other valuable items .

felt really rushed .
very unorganized place .
also the cars were n't cleaned very well .
not a hand wax on a car that is vinyl wrapped .
the massage chairs inside are awesome !
they picked my car up , which was cool .
and these were very visible areas .
very disappointing .
then he tells me the dog hair will only come out with a shampoo .
hair was barely touched .
car was coated in it .
the service is terrible !
i really regret taking my car to green valley car wash .
Negative

good money wasted .
never tip them before you check the work .
never going back .
so freaking annoying .
they called this an exam and charges $ _num_ .
this is absolutely ridiculous .
she called prior to me going to have what she wanted ready .
other vets use a different service and you only pay one fee , once .
this puts you in a wet room ( ? )
also , consider paying cash .
seriously worst experience ever .
but that is n't enough to ever send me back .
they received confirmation from my insurance stating that services would be covered .
leave me alone lady .
more than a third of the washers are out of service .

rude .
instead of any friendly exchange .
we probably spend about _num_ bucks a month on books .
associate looks at us like we are speaking french .
she was almost looking for a fight , which stunned me .
it is easily located off of stephanie between warm springs and sunset .
i guess next time i just look for myself or buy a gift card .
i had my haircut by _num_ barbers in this shop .
full disclosure - i am a platinum member at marriott .
this is your typical courtyard , decorated about the same as all others .
there was a lock bar which we used and worked just fine .
friday 's and joes crab shack are walking distance .

save your money and stay away !
they may have discounted prices but that goes with cheap furniture .
do n't waist your time !
not an honest place .
less than a year later i had to get it fixed again .
it did never leak again .
no thanks .
well it come as a kit and we use really good parts !
would n't have written this review !
for a grand total of $ _num_ .
i will not be returning .
served with grilled pineapple salsa and our signature jalapeno jelly . ''
- again , this was just okay as well .

rice and black beans were tasty .
first off , not so grande .
frankly , i 'm still a bit shocked .
not much taste at all .
terrible !
poor customer service .
it 's not the best dining experience .
rude .
i grabbed another menu and ordered the mesquite chicken tacos .

even when it 's free .
upon ordering drinks , i ordered my daughter mac and cheese .
i mean , it wasnt a large amount ( less than $ _num_ ) .
the personnel at the store were nice though .
umm excuse me ?

service could use alot of work .
i went yesterday with my husband and _num_ year old .

she barely spoke english .
nasty and dirty place .
nasty sarah .
she was rude and unprofessional !

very rude !
she hands me a paper fan and says to do it myself !
horrible place !
i could of done a better job doing it myself !

teriyaki was really bad .
looked like tv dinner .
on our way out , i wished the next customer walking in good luck .
too bad .
the rice was dry , hard and cold .
yes the prices are cheap , but you get what you pay for .
first : i ordered my lunch and paid for it .
instead i paid $ _num_ .
i 'm really surprised this place has such good reviews .
the meat that was included was very fatty & not great quality .
this place was just a miss all together .
would n't recommend .
cheap lunch which is good .
the chicken was also cheap and fatty .
very disappointed ... .
they kept it _num_ degrees in there .
for many years dillard 's was my favorite store .
dresses that were identical except for the color were priced differently .
since then i have sent two emails and not recieved a reply .
after over _num_ min .
i went back to return it finding out it was three shades to dark .
worst customer service ever .
not this crap hole .
simply no acknowledgement at all !
is that so hard just to glance a second and say `` hi '' .
dryer broke down multiple times and towel racks would fall off all the time .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
my wife is allergic to pets .
ca n't wait to move !
it should be removed within _num_ hours so that it will come off .
Negative
the staff for the most part , in each department were helpful and knowledgeable .
not to mention the fact that entire boxes of flooring were delivered damaged .
i had a contractor standing by today to install the unit .
fridge water dispenser leaks , etc .
especially for a customer that just spent so much money in their store .
unbelievable .
spent around $ _num_ .
visited the store to see i could get the part .
unfortunately not .
designer and higher end better quality ones cost alot more though .
horrible management !
they may even suggest financing .
he sent me over to `` her '' .
she was overwhelmed helping _num_ people at a time .
`` oh , well , we ca n't find any of that . ''
just pass this place by .
sitting here waiting , waiting , waiting to be seen by a doctor .
check any other eye care service , notice they are all much much better !
i will never be back .
i 'm never coming back .
rude .
rude .
rude .
upon confirmation , i set my appointment for the next week .
not worth the aggravation .
their contacts are also more expensive than any other office that i called .
glasses and optometrist are two separate offices so they bill you separately .
i noticed a very long wait as people were filling out paperwork .
oh you know already huh ?
why because you want me to shut up and leave ?
anyway all i actually responded with was `` oh you know ? ''
worst experience in years .
certainly would not recommend .
thank you for that .
that is why i take it in every _num_ months to have it inspected !
wo n't go back .
it was horrible !
let me start off by saying , i love chicken wings .
they are one of my _num_ major food groups .
so its only natural that i visit this establishment very often .
i have worked in the restaurant business and i have never seen that .
keep in mind , this place closes after hours .
the bartender was the only server on duty at the time .
for starters , we got the cheese curds for $ _num_ .
just not good .
the mild sauce was flavorful but a little hot for my taste buds .
the blue cheese dipping sauce made it better .
hard to say when , though .
horrible service today !
this is vegas !
most people out here are n't american !
wings were terrible .
i 'm here trying to get me some tuesdays wings .
thats a little weird .
i like buffalo wild wings but this experience has changed that .
crappy food !
simply a horrible experience .
just hard bread .
strike _num_ : no ranch !
will not be back !
and the bartender could 've gotten a better tip from us !
i wish i talked to the manager .
so after work i went with my boyfriend since it was my birthday .
horrible place .
okay i 'm kinda late on my review but who cares it still matters .
i wish i talked to the manager .
so after work i went with my boyfriend since it was my birthday .
okay i 'm kinda late on my review but who cares it still matters .
worst service ever .
andrew was so rude !
i saw like _num_ in total !
excuse me ?
wrong !
we were wrong .
we were totally okay with sitting at a table and not drinking .
that was unnecessary and almost like a slap in the face .
once again unnecessary .
it was ridiculous .
waitress did nothing .
will not go back .
i had ordered cheese sticks , and my wife ordered wings .
the worse service !
very very sad .
completely horrible !
unacceptable !
wings should be hot not cold in temperature !
wish there was a star option !
horrible service .
so it gets worse .
terrible food .
our server was terrible .
this was my last visit to any bww .
worst costumer service ever !
this is not the first time .
that 's not wrong .
horrible service and food !
it is ice cold .
again no sorry nothing .
worse service ever !
that 's where the compliments stop .
the place was empty .
very weird .
we also had to wait forever for the check .
this place only earned two stars because the food is alright .
i kid you not .
it was insane .
not worth the hassle .
our third dish was the pasta with italian sausage for $ _num_ .
i had the sirloin steak and mashed potatoes .
blah .
this place recently had a car back into it .
annoying .
there is one there specially , maria , a heavy set hispanic lady .
no , never again .
wait time can be the same as a phone call .
do you not hire enough staff to service your customers ?
absolutely horrible pharmacy .
this is not the first time either .
the car behind me has already left .
i hate this place .
this is just basic customer service skills _num_ !
i could 've gotten cheaper and better cinnamon rolls at an average supermarket .
i believe she really needs basic training .
we are not going back .
i will not be returning .
i had the french toast w/ eggs & sausage .
my sausage was cold too .
note to self : must try the waffles .
i ate breakfast there every saturday and sunday for about _num_ years straight .
we were wrong .
very , very disappointed .
they said no substitutions .
walked out .
had breakfast here , and the food is typical diner style .
however , the sourdough toast was awesome !
i have n't been back .
because it 's not .
does the cook even look at what he 's serving ?
absolutely ridiculous .
i mean , has he seen my other review of blueberry hill on flamingo ?
i responded with a hearty `` meh '' and went back to work .
on the upside , the service was a little faster .
if i need comfort food asap , i 'm sticking with denny 's .
i went today , needing an egg fix and crispy hash browns .
sick !
lost my appetite .
for $ _num_ i would have expected better .
gross !
when i came in here , we were approached by a friendly manager .
gross .
they did not look good .
would not eat here again .
my husband and i went to have breakfast sunday .
are you kidding me ?
two eggs , sausage , hash browns for _num_ .
in vegas , off the strip , really .
i did not eat it .
receptionist was not very friendly .
they do for $ _num_ an hr .
although i have read everyone 's reviews , i may try it .
and i only yelped info that she gave me .
i really was expecting and needed my pictures as promised .
very disappointed .
probably wont go back to this place .
worst customer service ever .
this is unacceptable .
especially when we have a _num_ month old .
i also get chips and guac and a side of salsa .
i 'm thinking a couple of small pieces , a pinch would be nice .
she has noted several things to be fixed and will be working on improvements .
i get a significantly smaller portion than what i usually get at your restaurant .
never ate at a chipotle again .
if you ask for extra anything they will ignore you .
we pay a premium so do n't nickel and dime me .
bad customer service _num_ .
i did n't even need a receipt .
i 've been to this location many times and , given them many chances .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ outside ... and we r on a work break ?
they need a manager to make sure everyone is working .
i could n't believe it .
i was near sunset station and craving mexican food .
gross !
a huge disappointment .
have n't had chipotle since moving .
i got chicken tacos with pico .
soggy !
one taco had very little chicken on it .
areas normally touched by numerous past customers were black .
they 're good , it 's just that i 've had better .
not too impressed , to tell you the truth .
possibly the most disappoint greek food i 've eaten .
i visited las vegas in december and went shopping with my mom and grandma .
sales were posted all over the store .
no bread came .
( nothing special ) .
in the meantime there was a musician who was playing in the dining room .
fail .
the chicken is very salty .
too salty .
but i like their mashed potatoes and their coleslaw and mac n cheese .
is that a kfc trend or just this location ?
worst place ever .
i ca n't image why kfc allows them to operate under their name .
worst place ever .
get your act together , kfc !
very poor management .
i 've never written a review - this place deserves it .
3rd time ; last time .
they 've parked me twice .
Neutral
bull shit !
turns out they have assigned stations that are to be played .
this is an american style burrito place .
i wish they would bring back the mango salsa .
the management here needs to put the cleaning gloves on and their glasses apparently .
terrible !
first , their design of ordering is not laid out well .
very poor service .
food was bland .
salsas were bland .
this is a fast food joint , not a sit-down restaurant with table service .
just a horrible meal .
sometimes you just need to stick to basics .
i have visited sammy 's locations in california and arizona .
but , alas , i had the same experience at the henderson location .
lame .
the `` creamy herb dressing '' was just ranch .
the crust was flavorless .
no sauce = no bueno .
i ended up going to cold stone where i knew i would be happy .
pizza was not exciting .
the location is a little difficult to find .
menu not filled with foods that sounded good to me .
ok , i guess .
we went again for lunch and asked for the pizza with vegan cheese .
ok , first off , this place is ridiculously priced !
rude !
they sale burgers by the oz here .
my boyfriend says they usually are n't like that though .
not cool fatburger !
dirty tables and floors .
the manager was very accomodating .
very disappointed !
eh ... take your business to _num_ guys .
are you kidding me ?
kudos to the wait staff who were extra friendly .
unacceptable !
they are the wal-mart of liquor stores , enough said !
wrong .
the more i spend the more you charge to deliver ?
keep it short & sour like my experience .
lazy , lazy , lazy !
i 'll give my business and reviews to total wine from now on .
no bueno ?
not here .
there were very , very few beers of note here .
i 'll continue to go to total wine in the future .
super annoyed & pissed !
i do n't carry a giant purse !
totally disappointing !
i mean , come on !
i go over hit the button but nothing happens .
i respond , `` it 's probably just jammed .
bummed out my sunday .
nothing is cold .
one is _num_ degree the other is _num_ degrees .
not sure but that 's not safe .
do n't talk down to a customer like that .
it was n't cheap either .
this doctor seems to not think that skin cancer is a priority .
he refused .
his exam room is a public gallery .
went to about _num_ visits with him .
i wish i had looked here first .
his solution to me was to go and visit the plastic surgeon next door .
i am livid at this point .
no thanks .
we plan on seeing someone else just to be on the safe side .
awful awful awful !
awful awful awful !
doctor made me uncomfortable .
what the hell ?
horrible customer service .
first , it was incredibly difficult to find !
it 's not a good deal .
believe me i made several phone calls , the phone just rang and rang .
should n't it be free ?
this will be the last time my family of _num_ ate coming here .
pretty disappointing !
maybe ill just try another location .
what a disappointment .
the food seems to be mostly heated up frozen chicken patties etc .
the waiter was fabulous , he was really on top of things .
why people love the olive garden is a complete mystery to me .
disgusting .
was invited by coworkers .
they actually served a concoction of minced chicken with cheese and spinach .
just pathetic .
clueless service and disgusting food .
the staff has always been awesome when i 've gone .
mixed review .
our alcoholic beverages had more ice than any other place i 've been to .
terrible customer service .
first off i want to say i usually love the olive garden .
but tonight was awful .
total was $ _num_ and change .
and _num_ breadsticks was it .
the calamari was cold and hard .
take your pick , you 'll get better service .
i guess that 's why we have n't eaten there in _num_ years .
my in-laws got the cheese raviolis with meat sauce .
there was also a lemon flavored one as well as a tiramisu version .
it is very loud and somewhat cramped in the restaurant .
salad came out quickly .
ordered the lobster ravioli , wife had the chicken parm .
now i just have to get the bottom out and i 'm done .
hi sam ( general manager ) my name is diane .
it came out swimming in sauce like soup !
they brought out two bowls of plain pasta for us to add to dish .
customer service is terrible .
gross !
ridiculous !
but how can you complain about customers where they can hear you .
no professional at all !
two ordered the eggplant parm , one the chicken parm .
eggplant was cold .
i have not tipped less than _num_ % in years .
like i said , this place blows !
first off , this place is cramped and small .
they probably only have about _num_ spa chairs for pedicures .
this lady nearly took off all my skin on my legs .
i got a complete new set of white tip acrylics .
but i am a little upset that they are thin and one broke already .
i was even talked out of the color i actually wanted .
there was no wait .
not like they were busy .
rude !
bathroom door did n't lock .
big mistake !
i walked out .
_num_ .
not since moving to henderson though .
i am not sure why this is .
sephora ... sephora 's where it 's at .
not ulta .
ick .
`` limited quantities !
the store itself is much smaller than say , sephora , with less selection .
not anymore !
i made an appointment for 7:30 pm on a friday .
i called the salon and spoke to the manager on monday .
she was extremely apologetic , and seemed to really want to fix the issue .
the new appointment was set for _num_ pm on tuesday , the following day .
if that happens , i will update this again .
seriously , there 's nothing you can do ?
do i want to use product ?
i recommend trying another ulta .
they mostly were all chit chatting instead of helping customers .
every time i come in to this location i always get followed around .
register service was not pleasant .
did n't check up on me or anything .
ulta salon is terrible .
the cashiers look like they hate their job too .
i really think ulta must have a huge issue with theft .
this is my least favorite location .
horrible horrible horrible !
i feel like such an idiot .
every time i was assured .
$ _num_ later .
if only their staff was just as awesome as their marketing team .
that is not the problem .
i shopped somewhere else instead .
ladies you all can put on some proper matching foundation .
the costumer service could be better too .
my eyebrows look terrible !
never going back !
i frequently visit ulta for all my hair products and have always been pleased .
do not come here .
bad customer service .
bad bad bad .
i had $ _num_ in gift cards i was ready to get down with !
there 's a bunch of colors , just try a different one .
but nothing .
i wish i new these employees names .
could n't care less .
these apartments are horrible .
the office staff changed _num_ times except for john .
yes , _num_ months !
excuse me ?
suddenly the voice changed to a female one - with attitude .
i dont think im ever coming back .
the thermostat at the counter read _num_ when i went to place my order .
maybe that 's just because the place itself was freezing .
wo n't be back .
it 's disappointing .
worst ever .
horrible .
the worst .
i have not eaten at wendy 's for many years .
it never fails that i always have to repeat what i order twice .
not to make sure that my order is right but as i 'm ordering .
i feel so screwed !
worst service ever .
i 'm never going back .
worst wendy 's ever !
horrible on returns .
sorry you lost my business .
do n't let their uniforms fool you .
i found the cashier to be inept .
crazy , huh ?
this place however just blah .
awkward .
not this steak .
if i came bk here again , i 'd def .
not order steak !
not really when you consider the quality of food served to you .
my husband ordered the steak salad and i ordered ahi sesame salad .
red peppers , cilantro , sesame seeds , almonds and sesame vinaigrette .
first impressions bad !
i , of course , asked for the manager and explained my concern .
she arrived with new waters and covered straws `` from the bar . ''
big mistake !
service was n't the best either .
big disappointment outback ... .
their reservation system is n't reservations .
they just put on the waiting list early .
the food was fine .
recently , this restaurant relocated .
i visited outback _num_ times in the last year due to friends going there .
no refills .
unpleasant waitress .
overcrowded and the staff is over matched .
i have been wanting to return to outback since the new henderson location opened .
the drinks also arrived quickly .
the prime rib was pretty good , not much fat which was nice .
it was just very thin .
thoroughly disappointing .
food was lousy .
only comes medium well ?
horrible .
guest ordered the sirloin and coconut shrimp .
terrible !
so disappointed .
poor service and dirty ... .
not your typical outback .
food is ok , yet not the best one we 've been to .
disappointing !
however , i believe that this dining experience deserved to be shared .
everything was good , the server was friendly .
no biggie .
the carrot cake was very dense and too sweet for my taste .
the potatoes were very dry .
my _num_ year old son also ordered the sirloin and unlimited shrimp .
my steak was cook medium well , not medium like i ordered .
imagine a dry hard steak !
we ordered and they brought the bill over .
but this restaurant i have a hard time getting clean tables .
food is terrible .
it looked a mess .
my one comment to the owner is take your name down .
what an awful experience !
their service really stinks .
our ( _num_ ) small dogs , one service and one regular pet .
the only nice part was our waitress .
the wait time for everything was ridiculously long .
bad experience .
mashed potatoes were cold .
the atmosphere feels like warehouse seating .
terrible customer service .
does this sound like competent maintenance ?
maintenance is almost non-existent .
these people are sick .
the list really goes on and on .
just do n't move here .
they spread to my apartment , which then had to be heat treated .
after a bunch more complaints , they were moved to another apartment .
this is a weekly police visit .
i kept all my copies and receipts for this reason exactly .
spend your extra penny 's else where .
do not rent from crystal creek !
their just there to make money .
on top of the reviews , i 've continued to hear additional rumors .
just plain awful .
pizza was awful .
totally disgusted .
how the heck am i talking to you if my phone is cut off !
awful customer service !
the bartender quickly came over and asked what i wanted to drink .
i instantly was not thrilled .
you 're so cheap you buy big containers of ketchup and portion it out ?
are you _num_ ?
is this _num_ ?
they dont hassle you like other dealers in town .
it was really dirty .
they also added tons of miles on the car while they had it .
there were items left in my car like someone had used it to move .
also a beer bottle cap and receipt for lunch .
they are the worst !
they book _num_ weeks to _num_ weeks out .
horrible service department !
she was able to get me in the very next morning _num_ am sharp .
i am shocked at the level of customer service down there .
salespeople : not pushy , friendly , very helpful .
& absolutely not .
sure feels like it for me .
the car had issues from day _num_ .
my family has bought a total of _num_ cars from carmax over the years .
purchased car from henderson carmax on sunday .
we are _num_ hours into our day with them .
it 's absolutely ridiculous !
the employees were helpful and the location is convenient off the freeway .
the sales consultant , paul l. was fantastic .
first off , i purchased the extended warranty .
the first car i purchased from carmax needed a lot of work .
please do your research before deciding to purchase from carmax .
it seems like the same story over and over again .
of course , their warranty only covers _num_ days for a rental .
of course i did n't it just happened .
that 's ridiculous .
so they gave me a loaner car .
horrible experience .
charge to my visa card .
$ _num_ for it .
horrible experience .
now again , this is an eight thousand mile car !
there the same size rim and tire as stock .
car is ok.
if you are selling a car please check around to get a better deal .
terrible service !
ok hop in the car and boom check engine light pops on once again .
get a call a week later car is finally done .
no one ... .
so sad !
they tried to steal my money !
they offered us $ _num_ this time .
horrible experience .
the process was relatively fast .
where has all the customer service gone ?
i 've bought and sold cars from carmax for _num_ plus years .
picked out car , day prior to signing papers .
came in at _num_ am to sign papers .
very disorganized .
very disappointing .
i was disappointed .
it greatly pains me to write this review , but here goes .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
my food was just ok.
sloppy service and dirty .
they have weiss , summerlin has bagel cafe as the resident jewish deli .
i 've tried the baked goods and the deli food .
passable , but not something i would buy again .
their corned beef , however , is decent as are the bagels .
but , jewish deli is serious business .
lady at the front was the same i spoke to on the phone .
i was really eager to try this place .
i was expecting a rich , tangy , tomato base .
bland , bland , bland .
not the best deli i 've ever been to !
shame on you !
let me start by saying i think i just had a subpar experience .
this is a little lengthy , but hear me out .
not good .
the syrup was nasty .
it was thicker than honey and had to be spread with a knife .
she was very short with us .
this was mediocre .
it tastes homemade but not as good as other homemade around town .
service is beyond rude .
this was my 4th and last time here .
we up and walked out .
very poor service .
is unacceptable .
he brings the drinks drops them and leaves .
in the meantime , these other two ( waitresses ?
still no waitress around .
you have a staff problem .
big mistake !
i returned to the store with my now cold pancakes .
but i guess they make too much money to keep people happy .
my daughter and i ate weiss deli last month .
sometimes you want cheap fast food italian .
i had the cheese ravioli along with salad and breadsticks .
seriously you can find better chicken parm at sara lee .
really really disgusting !
it seems too suspicious .
the other employee was wearing a red shirt and a hat .
it was good but not spectacular .
well first she came back .
the bf : he said well can you fix it ?
being under new management , late night out partying ?
soooo disappointed .
so sad .
it was really lackluster .
let me tell you ... they 're not to be found at this store !
seems misleading .
big mistake !
my earlier review of village pub was much more favorable .
the food is not as good , period .
now , the sauce is so buttery it breaks when it cooks .
the burgers are never the right temperature .
not so much .
will not eat here again !
went here before hitting a movie .
the beer was not fresh .
its garbage .
_num_ sandwiches total .
get home _num_ sandwiches .
it makes no sense .
note : this location is still better than the sunset and stephanie location .
but every night they do not .
looking at the menu it has more options then most _num_ star restaurants .
there was more fried outer shell on the nuggets than chicken .
i was there to get my nails taken off and get a gel manicure .
it was really uncomfortable .
poor communication !
thumbs down !
she quickly did my toes and nails .
my bf had used this place oh about _num_ times .
... nope no thanks .
.
they 're all about function and not so good at the form .
this place is ridiculously expensive !
$ _num_ for taking out links ?
no help at all .
customer service stinks .
not even a text back .
i like american eagle 's jeans .
so you can get me a fitting room when i ask nicely .
if that 's someone else 's job , direct me to that person .
that 's so rude .
worst customer service ever .
never going back .
if i can not purchase them , you might as well close your doors .
big loss to michaels .
messy store as well .
this store is a joke !
the manager of this store needs to do a better job training people .
wo n't go back .
so lazy !
poor customer service !
terrible customer service .
rip off .
their company policy is to offer _num_ % off lowest price .
terrible customer service !
just wait until i get a survey on my receipt !
that is if i decide to come back and shop here again .
never buying anything from this store again .
Negative
no integrity or whatsoever .
the selection is severely lacking .
the second she finished ringing me up , she was back on the phone .
seriously over this place .
i 've been getting my eyebrows waxed here for years !
it was like getting your nails done by a grumpy receptionist .
never going back .
they have stole money from me before !
my nails _num_ days into my `` gel '' fill .
so disappointing !
very rude .
mine barley lasted a week .
worst denny 's ever !
the hash browns were nothing outstanding either .
graveyard cook was horrible .
will not go back there .
who says this to someone entering a restaurant ?
giving two stars because the food was correct and pretty delish .
i get the same breakfast in any denny 's that i go to .
the grits were cold .
wrong .
a little odd , but okay .
the presentation was horrible .
horrible customer service !
slow !
again terrible service .
the customer service sucked .
the cooks ca n't cook .
very dirty place .
terrible if not horrific service .
worst part of all .
but tonight was ridiculous .
i only saw one waitress who was slammed with tables as time went on !
first off , her hashbrowns had the whole onion chopped up on top !
i came in with my mother yesterday morning for breakfast .
i ordered mine with pancakes , hashbrowns , sausage links and bacon .
when i looked in the kitchen , he was there , being the cool .
i visited this location tonight as i have many times .
i love this place but tonight was in character with its halloween decisions .
watched customers get up and leave .
where was the team work ?
not okay .
came for the pumpkin pecan pancakes that i see endless commercials about .
waiter : just sit anywhere .
we came for an early breakfast 5am .
so pissed !
horrible experience !
seated promptly , drink orders taken , we ordered .
replacement salad was better but ordinary .
ihop or grand cafe at sunset will get our business .
big mistake !
my chicken tenders were a few shades darker than i have ever seen them .
ugh .
_num_ .
or ( c ) you already have _num_ of those at home !
_num_ .
_num_ .
someone needs to clean this place up and stock the damn shelves .
this is the second time i 've seen him and he always never smiles .
i thought you all went to school for this .
i have very thick hair and it was very long .
well i hated it .
rude staff !
casino valle verde has like _num_ .
it 's so sad .
the units are crap .
ca n't wait to move out .
do not rent to these people !
just is really old .
place is never cleaned and i am always having problems with parking spots .
so annoying !
this place is horrible .
nothing was done !
there was a shooting here the other night that was in the news .
may god guide them through their hard times .
i recommend not moving here .
the my bath water just turned grey .
worst place to live .
issues with maintenance and front office staff all the time .
this is wrong .
just plain wrong .
no maintenance anywhere whatsoever .
horrible place , horrible management .
would you get up and leave ?
he will not get anything done .
the upgraded appliances are cheap .
like horribly .
it is so gross .
never consider moving here .
horrible office staff .
so unprofessional , and rude .
by far , the most ghetto place i 've ever lived .
utterly atrocious !
customer service said i should of called them first .
i want my down filled pillows !
my next stop is going to be small claims court .
take it or leave it attitude .
total cost $ _num_ .
now i 'm not buying a bike .
or even a $ _num_ t-shirt .
i 'm trying to buy two $ _num_ poker chips .
i could easily have spent a lot of money there .
they just kept dying .
completely dishonest .
liars terrible customer service .
i went to henderson hd for years to service my ultra .
it 's garbage .
again , garbage .
waste of $ _num_ !
i will not be returning .
but , in a pinch and drunk i guess this place is ok .
ordering baked ziti was easier and yet better .
the salad was not worth _num_ .
i just ordered some food tonight from napoli .
the first time , while expensive , the food was awesome .
how is everything ... nothing .
you are going to burn pizza ?
the greek pizza was blah .
_num_ star , and even that has n't been earned in this case .
i had the _num_ sausage slices with a drink for $ _num_ .
however my 1st experience was not .
food was horrible .
it was dark brown , too , not a rich red .
wrong again .
even the frosting looked old .
she was short with me and everyone who called trying to place an order .
almost no roast beef .
awful !
super pizza has better knots .
what poor customer service !
so i decide to call napoli based on yelp reviews .
normally , i get the _num_ '' pickup special for $ _num_ .
however , when i got the pizza , it was the _num_ '' .
i really have nothing more to say about this place .
maybe trying to make small talk since they seemed rather cold upon initial contact .
horrible !
it was cold !
the other macaroni and cheese another girl ordered was fine .
have n't been on time the last three times .
the ladies behind the counter are n't too helpful .
not impressed at all .
pizza tasted ok .
total was suppose to be $ _num_ .
i had _num_ people to feed and _num_ entrees !
absolute terrible customer service !
_num_ times !
the chicken wings are always crispy and on point .
another waste .
complete failure all around .
bad service .
the first time i ordered it , it was awesome .
the last three times i 've ordered it not so much .
i would not recommend this place .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
me and coworkers split the same meal today around _num_ .
the order of medium boneless wings were probably frozen .
will not be back .
i ordered a new york style cheese pizza and a greek pizza .
it was dreadful .
messed up our order and staff had to wait almost an hour .
thanks for the cold pizza and the cold shoulder .
go to metro pizza and you 'll be much happier .
what disgusting food .
i feel so cheated .
i 'm so pissed .
Negative
pizza , burgers , salads .
since we had the same zip code , i figured i would call .
no hello , nothing .
bad music .
they do n't mean it .
no free garlic balls .
we tried the extra cheese but it just becomes too much .
the 3/4 times we 've ordered them it 's never crispy .
cold pizza .
food was not good at all .
the chicken tasted old and was hard .
total garbage .
hour wait for a dine in pizza .
horrible customer service .
i ordered a ravioli and _num_ large pizzas .
just left this place .
then i ate the boneless chicken and it was completely salty .
absolutely ridiculous .
cold , rubbery and wrong .
i sat down to wait on the food .
in the past _num_ months or so , it has been on the decline .
never going back .
i ordered a turkey sub , french fries and a salad two hours ago .
i am less than _num_ miles away .
i ordered baked ziti and a cannoli .
it 's gross .
it looked appetizing and was a huge portion .
garbage .
wrong .
the wings and fingers are good but average relative to any other pizza joint .
i 'm from chicago so the pizza here to me was just decent .
a little friendliness will go a long way .
they stole $ _num_ from me .
it 's really overpriced too .
not a great way to celebrate my birthday .
our last order from napoli really changed our views on the restaurant .
second , i think they are over priced all around .
whoa , not digging the new decor at all !
food terrible .
i should know , i have a few pair .
they stretch okay ... .
do n't exercise in them ... .
my two gals i mainly run with are naturally f cups .
f cups .
gross !
service here was n't any better .
she probably did n't notice .
the job was not complete .
our dog was still wet and not brushed out .
they do not have my recommendation .
dr rose was very attentive and seemed to really care about the situation .
not to be trusted .
but i noticed one of my puppies had scratches on his face !
i bent over to pick up one of the dogs and he yelped .
$ _num_ just for reading check engine light .
this is not a bargain place .
been here a few times now and only half the car gets washed .
this places is useless !
too little means we left with a tank not full .
i have been going to first choice for years , a very long time .
sue is my go to gal .
going back will not happen .
again , she rushed it .
horrible !
everytime i attempt to go there it 's always bs .
rude ass ppl .
a crying shame .
so i am posting this review due to my experience at this salon .
some random employee told me to `` choose color '' .
once he removed the gel , he applied the gel polish like i wanted .
he was rushing me out the door , due to the closing time .
once he got on the phone he came off very aggressive to me .
i go to this nail salon frequently .
the low grade is for the self service car wash .
idiots .
i asked for my money back .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the odor is coming from the closet most heavily on occasion .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i do not recommend living here .
also , the upper units are very difficult to cool .
the living room never gets cool .
it 's smell like dog shit !
there are always random commercial vehicles parked in the lots taking up spaces .
terrible management company .
horrible .
no bread was offered .
honestly i 'd like to give the food _num_ star , especially their selections .
come on mimi 's ... is your soup and salad made from gold ?
but no .
pick _num_ of those choices on almost every visit .
i 'm beginning to wonder .
i walked up and saw them through the window chatting away .
the server on the other hand was another story .
she was not friendly at all .
followed by the turkey pesto sandwich .
that was just ok.
its stinks !
skip it .
wifi is very slow .
never see management out and about like you do at other restaurants .
they were not even done eating .
they were drinking waters .
their bill was _num_ dollars .
_num_ stars for the decor and $ _num_ happy hour on all wines .
no drinks and no bread .
after we were done the waiter offered us dessert .
service was a zero .
it was a long day so we opted to wait at the bar .
food good ... really good .
our waitress kept forgetting our drinks .
nothing special .
my mom and i were going there for a late lunch .
the hostess kept sitting people , who walked in after us , before us .
she did n't care that we were leaving .
boring place and bad service .
horrible experience .
over priced nasty food .
steak dinners were awful .
worst service ever .
well i was dead wrong .
loved the $ _num_ glass of merlot tonight along with penne pasta with meatballs .
will not go here again .
this reviews is bad .
i left without eating .
very misleading and disappointing .
the store i normally visit is on warm springs and marks .
i 'm strongly considering switching phone services because of this experience .
okay no big deal .
okay no big deal .
i could hear my dog calling out for me .
i was sure someone would come out and assist me .
i took my dog in to get her nails trimmed last night around 5:30 .
customer service at this store is not their highest priority .
there was two in the tank .
we ordered the garlic knots , hot wings and a _num_ topping pizza .
ok , so our pizza order was a little complicated .
he offered me a free topping for my next order .
anyway , the pizza was alright .
a little greasy for my taste but the crust was good .
skip this one .
the pizza is pretty generic .
but as of right now , they are looking like my next choice .
only on the strip you can get away with that !
if you like that sort of place , then you might like it here .
it was terrible !
only on the strip you can get away with that !
tomatoes that were dried out .
but it sure does n't deliver .
i will not be back .
no help at all .
not impressed for the price .
they could n't even eat it .
it comes with _num_ garlic knots and a salad .
i ordered plain spaghetti .
the owner was also acting like a grumpy old man .
mediocre , at best .
certainly not worth the money .
our order of wings came as such on all three occasions .
i got none of that .
went here twice over a _num_ month time frame .
i lived in nyc for _num_ years so my hopes were high .
been here several times i have lived here for _num_ years .
i got the sicilian with an antipasto salad for $ _num_ as take out .
purchased garlic knots hoping to bite into some fresh , warm , soft bread .
not fresh at all .
the bread was tasteless .
ohh , i ca n't forget about the salad .
it was like throwing pieces of lettuce on the plate .
it was just mayo with pepper seasoning .
annoyed i left .
how can you knock _num_ cent beer , pizza and wings ?
the service is terrible .
the food is only decent .
my sister saw on the website that there were fried oreo sundaes .
finally we left as well and went to the village pub down the street .
did i leave at this point ?
because clearly i 'm an idiot .
it 's really hard to screw that up .
oh yes , it 's still there , but now it 's $ _num_ .
no more discounts .
it was fine at $ _num_ , not so much at $ _num_ .
wo n't be back .
completely ignoring my groupon .
ate here for the first time this evening .
_num_ .
- this place is also a station casino .
fail .
- this place ca n't cook a steak .
i asked for a medium and they gave me a rare .
but expected since labeled healthy choice .
- potato was boring .
i can make a better potato at the feast buffet !
i tried the beer sampler last night .
it was weak .
the morning staff is awesome .
called over manger , tracy i believe , and explained or situation .
remember , breakfast only at this place .
it was nice and stiff .
stopped in here to try the brews and have some dinner .
the pretzel bites and pot stickers were pretty good .
just blah .
service was quick and polite , but not super personable .
i had the short stack of pancakes , and only got through half .
worst .
dry ribs , dry brisket .
pulled pork was flavorless .
hate to give this place _num_ stars .
the first thing i ordered were the shrimp cocktail .
no waitress !
i wish this establishment luck !
terrible experience .
no value at all .
$ _num_ for a soda ?
$ _num_ total .
ridiculous .
$ _num_ ?
again , ridiculous .
the beef enchilada was cold .
so the meal was cheap .
the prices were ridiculous .
beans and cheese and a tortilla ... $ _num_ bucks .
not so .
my a la carte taco was in a fried shell .
would not even give this restaurant one star !
disgusting .
have not seen prices this high in all of las vegas .
they really need to lower their prices if they expect to have customers !
it was nothing like what it was when i was growing up .
very disappointing .
to my surprise , it was better than i had expected .
typical , familiar and nice restaurant layout .
_num_ single taco with rice and beans anyone ?
salsa was bland .
food was terrible .
rice was bland .
food was very bland .
i ate two bite of my enchiladas .
it 's complimentary though .
we were all disappointed .
this hole in the wall place had an authentic vibe to it .
way overpriced and not authentic .
a saturday night out , the place was sort of busy .
could only imagine kitchen .
the taste was off .
i did n't really like it .
probably would n't go back .
horrible service .
i will not be coming here ever again .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
sorry not sorry .
they look like they absolutely hate their jobs .
slow service .
still the worst !
i had a little trouble finding the restaurant because it was hidden .
my group walked in and were seated immediately .
the waitress was very kind and immediately gave us menus and food settings .
so we tried this place _num_ months or so ago for dinner .
it was probably _num_ stars then .
the lunches came with `` fried rice '' that was basically dried yellow rice .
it was terrible .
so disappointed .
i wish i didnt have to select any stars .
they were pretty rude .
not _num_ .
we were very disappointed .
yup under the heat lamps for too long alright .
the sandwich was way too dry .
only got in two little bites and i was done .
crappy service , mediocre food .
there people are incompetent .
two people do n't cut it .
there are no cavities !
so , now my son goes to my dentist .
toys , tv room , staff was so sweet to our daughter .
they can not be trusted .
horrible bedside manner .
we took him to another dentist to get the infection under control .
i almost wish i didnt go in .
the sales lady was older ... much older .
so sad .
that 's why i keep going back .
three employees refused !
unacceptable !
i walked around up to the furniture and back to the men 's section .
not sure .
are you kidding me ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i hear walmart is hiring .
this place is terrible .
their equipment is old ( like from the 90s ) and a little sketchy .
but i was n't a fan .
and my husband the pork lo mein ( spicy ) .
as good as it could 've been .
first off i will agree , the staff are friendly .
nothing tasted remotely fresh .
first off i will agree , the staff are friendly .
nothing tasted remotely fresh .
have n't been back since though .
they obviously have a new chef and the friendly staff is gone .
however today i placed my order and went to pick my order up .
thought i would try something new , but i will stick to my restaurant .
it was very bland .
very , very bland .
the only dish we got that was decent was the garlic chicken .
i want my money back .
it 's too bad .
we 've been loyal customers to this establishment for a long time .
it is under new management according to the menu at the front desk .
the beef was soft and chewy .
this meal was not tasty .
i will not go here again .
and chicken was rubbery .
this ... was ridiculous .
i will never again go there .
they have _num_ brothers that own the place .
i 've been to other great steaks and had much better .
the first time i ordered a philly cheese steak and cheese fries .
i will not be returning .
_num_ cents .
bad customer service.
do not go to that place !
no hello , no nothing !
my husband ca n't handle spice at all and these had _num_ flavor .
i 've never been to any hooters that has given me good service .
plus , the food is n't all that great .
then she gave us an attitude problem .
the only draw is obvious from the name of the restaurant .
but that is why we have the internet .
could n't find a manager .
my male companion 's boneless wings were yummy too .
_num_ minute wait on the phone .
no straight answers .
dime a dozen .
not the case with the one in the henderson nv walmart .
this nonsense has to end .
every single employee here freaked me out this weekend .
next we browse the plants , pots , etc .
my error .
its wal-mart
why do these matter ?
seriously , nothing at wal-mart is even worth stealing .
maybe that 's the problem .
i hate walmart .
i hate this walmart !
_num_ stars .
what a mistake .
i inform her i need some ammo .
ridiculous .
that will teach them for getting a number before they are ready .
what the hell ?
wally world a necessary evil .
it has low prices and pretty much everything you need .
ill tell you designer shoe warehouse thought the `` d '' stood for discount .
well there are not many discounts .
i did n't even finish my meal .
such a disappointment .
drive thru stinks !
_num_ employees working .
poor service .
Negative
there was only another family inside .
save yourself the trouble and stay away .
Very negative
the employees were nice and apologetic , but the manager needs to get hiring .

horrible , horrible , horrible !
one there jacket was too short .
i understand some alterations have to be given but to all _num_ of them .
customer service is awful .
bad service .
bought _num_ suits , bob was very helpful .
they made it worse .
when i did finally receive service , it felt a bit rushed .
dang , they got some expensive stuff .
i 'm through with mens warehouse forever because of this store .
service sucks enough said .
garbage .
this location makes me never want to do business with this company again .
i would go have a beer with these folks .
worst customer service ever !
i really could n't believe it .
the fries were terrible .
another lady came over and apologized and said our food should be coming .
this is where it really started to suck .
me and my wife went here on super bowl sunday .
the place was empty !
i really wish this restaurant could get everything together !
was it a disaster ?
no bueno .
for the record this particular location is a hit and miss for the family .
it was almost like the fry nazi was working in the kitchen tonight !
filthy & horrible management .
overall , not pleased .
i remember them being so much better too .
big mistake .
_num_ .
i 'm going to guess _num_ oz or so .
_num_ .
miserable service .
_num_ min .
_num_ .
my fries were ice cold .
my husband 's burger was even less warm than mine .
his daughter had a turkey sandwich and soup .
_num_ . )
let it be know i 'm not taking this review out on her .
_num_ . )
unacceptable .
_num_ . )
are you kidding me ?
disappointing and absolutely appalling !
we received _num_ cups of the soup with the pretzel bites .
another fail .
also , do n't most restaurants clean before or after being open ?
worst customer service !
never going back !
truly awful .
she received her entree after everyone else ate and it was still cold !
in-n-out makes a better burger and is half the price .
customer lost .
maybe that 's why i get appetizers since i 'm waiting a while .
i 'm pissed .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ minutes later ... .
_num_ .
never again !
on the up side , i would think dine in service is better .
we ordered my daughter grilled chicken and apple slices .
the chicken they server my _num_ year old was raw inside .
my main thing was hot food !
however , the quality of the service was an entirely different story .
Neutral
the kids meals were brought with the appetizers rather than with our meals .
it was all sam adams and miller brands , so i ordered iced tea .
my wife and i used to go to this red robin all the time .
completely disgusting !
do n't eat here !
totally gross !
skip it !
first off , the appetizer arrived at the same time as the entrees .
the visit included me , my daughter , and my wife .
i got the chicken wrap with the chicken tortilla soup .
terrible service .
she walked away annoyed .
she took over for our server and was extremely attentive .
there is a reason this location has _num_ stars .
i do n't care .
your job is to be on time , not making customers wait .
only 1/4 work deserves 1/4 tip .
no apologies from the server .
so i guess that 's a plus .
they need to hire more waiters .
_num_ stars .
this past visit was definitely my last for quite a while .
is it truly impossible to receive hot fries without complaining about it ?
has n't checked on us once .
one of the hostesses asked him to check on our appetizers .
the food was greasy and over cooked .
the manager really needs training or a different career .
i 'm sure it 's better than this place .
slow service !
didnt really feel like i was a valued guest .
the waitress was friendly though .
our server was pretty cranky .
worst ihop ever !
it ruined out breakfast .
this will be the last time i go to this i hop .
chicken fingers werent cooked .
sure enough , that 's exactly what they were , same pancakes just heated .
i was disappointed .
poor service .
we gave up after _num_ min .
terrible service .
left to go inside so i could speak to someone that spoke english .
i hate fast food chains .
my boss was craving fries and this was the closest stop .
as for myself , i struggled to finish my grilled chicken sandwich .
place is disgusting !
more homeless people hanging out asking for change the the street corner !
there is always a line to the door or out the door .
even plain bagels ?
this location is not run very well .
some customers just left the store .
but , they had hours until they closed .
it 's been busy both times i 've gone in .
they need more people in the mornings to make it flow better .
bad service .
not the experience today !
very disappointed .
service is consistently poor .
my bagel as not toasted .
i had my bagel and i still had to wait for her .
there is only one high chair and very rarely anywhere to sit .
it 's just not worth it .
my son and i have birthdays a week apart .
no big deal .
she was a older lady , security guard .
what 's so hard about that and move on .
i could n't believe it .
just sad .
and the customers here make it way harder than it should be .
what a terribly disappointing place .
my father was a resident in this nursing home for almost two years .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i am very busy ! ''
day _num_ of of _num_ for morning visit .
so , they do the bare minimum , nothing more .
first impression lasts .
jasmine the front desk is not in anyway interested to help us .
that 's unacceptable .
this was not the case .
leave car at _num_ am for oil change .
very disappointing .
ridiculous !
i had a groupon so decided to try it .
long story short just do n't go here !
the chips were super cheap and salty .
terrible service !
ok mex , but not just feels cheap .
why cheap you say ?
went there last night in hopes of finding some decent mexican food .
met a friend for dinner and it was an ok experience .
the salsa bar was pretty messy .
very pricy for the types of selections to choose from .
i just ordered from the appetizers because it just seemed tastier .
it was flavorless .
he returns with place settings .
service was slow .
he commented that we could have made much better tacos at home .
but a salsa bar ca n't save this place .
skip it .
the vegetables were cooked well but tasted mostly of salt .
fish tacos taste fishy .
carne asada taste of cheap seasoning .
this is a pretty standard mexican food with pretty standard service .
it is located inside of sunset station in henderson .
the service was horrible !
food was horrible !
hire new employees as soon as possible .
told unlimited chips but never appeared .
never had an opportunity to order another drink .
the chicken parmesan was pretty average .
for some reason , it smelled and tasted of seafood .
completely gross .
they used to be much better .
russell did n't get that .
the food was terrible !
it was bad !
walked in on a saturday evening and was seated immediately .
each item was under $ _num_ , which was cool !
too sweet and to sour all at the same time .
it had shrimp , mussels , scallops in a marinara sauce over linguini .
was n't impressed by the food .
i always get the spaghetti bolognese with house salad and breadsticks .
the worst customer service .
disgusting but whatever .
_num_ stars for that .
the bread is like olive garden bread but not as soft or moist .
did n't eat it .
at least _num_ min .
the experience really turned out whole stomach .
so i 'm not trying to put anyone on blast .
we visit sunset station regularly and finally got around to visiting this restaurant .
it tasted of plain tomatoes and tin can .
no apologies , nothing .
are you kidding me ?
medium and medium well to me is not blood rare ( almost blue ) .
i am so disappointed !
it was just wrong !
we also had a side of mac and cheese and the lump crab cake .
it was good , yes , but very expensive in my opinion .
very lackluster .
horrible .
her potato was rotten .
place has gone down hill .
never going back .
not a good sign .
a little vinegar on top .
the chef came out , apologized , and offered to cook a new steak .
unbelievable .
just my luck , i guess .
i ordered the _num_ dollar steak .
nobody knows , nobody cares .
shady practice , be careful .
the sale on our original vehicle went without a hitch .
the 2nd , not so well !
i was having problems with my truck 's performance and it was smoking .
worst place ever !
truly pathetic and disappointing .
john flagged down a salesperson by the name of patrick .
i kept telling him i just want to drive the car and such .
i used to purchase only chevy .
no kidding .
_num_ .
he lost a sale .
just because we mentioned that we would like to get a gm family discount ?
less than pleased with the henderson chevrolet service department .
a little follow up would be appreciated .
i was passed off to a salesman .
this has happened two oil changes in a row ?
ridiculous .
service department has let me down two out of two times .
did i mention that i 'm _num_ months pregnant ?
wtf is that how rude .
same payment , same type of car and a particular color ) .
they also found a problem that cost approx .
he was very very late in calling me back to give me an update .
worst place ever !
so i went without ac for two years .
horrible place .
horrible place .
long story short .
person says i have to wait 24hrs .
what idiots !
so out of four services i requested , only one had been done .
slow ... very slow .
the rental car they gave me was a chevy sonic .
ridiculous !
i 'm very disappointed !
so i went to the dealership and signed the paperwork .
must read !
_num_ thru _num_ .
my salesman put in a lot of work trying to find me a vehicles .
pricing : this is not carmax !
carmax is a store , this is a dealership .
so there is some room on the price .
so , i left .
purchased a car there in _num_ and the sales department was pretty good .
the manager then offered a rental car to remedy the situation .
to begin with , an appointment for oil change was made without my knowledge .
that was ridiculous !
Negative
worst service experience !
they put me in a rental and kept my car for two days .
unbelievable .
_num_ full day with overnight for an oil change ?
the worst !
but they over charge for the type of haircuts they give .
i 've been here a few times for my oil change and warranty service .
i got mike this time , he was somewhat friendly .
i called for an appointment for fix the ac and do an oil change .
had the ac work done i had originally called about the following saturday .
the staff was friendly and i expected it to be an all day thing .
so , i stopped using it .
not say we need a computer code to replace it .
customer service was terrible .
so rude .
ok , whatever ill get my invoice when i get home .
what bunch of crap .
i explain why i 'm here and we walk over to a table .
he sits down and begins to write down my information , fair enough .
private sale it 's worth _num_ , maybe .
never even consider this place .
unprofessional , lazy , rude .
rude and ridiculous .
do not go to henderson nissan !
lesson learned .
horrible service .
thank god we left cause planet nissan did everything that we wanted and more .
worse service ever !
low and behold the salesman said they were part of the program .
henderson nissan is not part of the costco auto buying program .
this is just a sales review , not parts or service .
looking to buy a nice used jeep .
then they also wanted $ _num_ in fees !
run for the hills !
sooo not true !
no fuss or frills .
not happening .
avoid !
terrible customer service .
took all of a little over _num_ hours to get my new car !
the worst !
are you kidding me ?
he was making unnecessary comments about me ( the customer ) .
i was very disappointed .
i was completely wrong .
he was rude .
how disappointing .
these guys are the typical shady car buying experience .
this kind of car buying experience i can pass on .

this place is ridiculous .
_num_ minutes in lobby .

Negative
this added an hour and a half to our already one hour wait time .
we decide we might as well take the courtesy shuttle to galleria mall .
wrong .
that 's ridiculous .
does not acknowledge us .
not follow up or communication .
we will have to get a attorney to get to the bottom of this .
settle in friends , it 's gon na be a long one .
it 's not .
safety feature my butt ... .
theyre ridiculous .
this rating is strictly for the service department .
no thanks .
this is not small stuff .
it 's total bullshit !
seemed very put off .
i dropped my car off at _num_ am for my 10:30 am service appointment .
first , let me say my car buying experience was a _num_ !
the _num_ stars is for follow up customer service .
i visited findlay around 4pm on a wednesday after i got off from work .
salesman a complete jerk !
at least after reading some reviews i know it 's not just me .
f that dealer .
letters were written to upper management .
no thanks findlay .
eventually they gave me a loaner .
slow slow service .
seems a little long .
i arrived a couple of hours before closing in the evening .
horrible and dishonest service department .
horrible customer service .
i was so disappointed .
the only decent person here is the greg a - the salesmen .
once you buy a car customer service is done .
yes it was used but they said everything was good , everything got fixed .
purchased the extended warranty and it does n't cover anything .
not a fan .
when i picked up the car they sent me to the cashier .
i 'm not a mechanic , that 's why i brought it in .
the car is _num_ months old and under warranty .
i recently had my car worked on there .
customer service was terrible .
they use bait and switch tactics and hide money in the deal .
service department is horrible !
everything the do is driven by the dollar !
only response was that online appointments will be kept all day .

glad to know that customer service is a priority .
awful customer service .
they lost a customer .
this dealership sold me an unsafe car !
avoid !
we then filled out an application to see if we qualify .
doc fee , title , taxes , mandatory alarm system .
they try to sell very expensive extra warranty .
this is a situation where it 's black and white .
all same name , same address .
i get that , i stop posting reviews .
bottom line , be careful if you decide to purchase a ford .
the next morning there is oil all over the driveway .
very rude and unpleasant .
avoid this place !
never get any calls back from anyone .
would not go here again .
why get a dealership oil change when they nickel and dime you to death ?
i was waiting for my oil change and grabbed a bite to eat .
blt , no mayo ?
will not be back .

findlay repair shop sucks !
recently had my car in for a/c fan repair .
the offer was to low which is fine .
i went in to this dealership to purchase a vehicle .
are you kidding me ?
spend your money elsewhere !
and it never has !
went again for a routine oil change - made an appointment .
finally sat down to fill out the service order .
i was mad so they gave me a free future oil change .
damn check engine light came on after two years causing me smog headaches .
he was very polite to my girlfriend and made our experience much better .

_num_ .
_num_ .

getting service from a dealership is never cheap .
it 's very inconvenient to have to make additional trips .
ended up purchasing from bmw of las vegas .
liars and thieves !
when i started talking to steve he became very aggressive towards me .
this is another lie .
are you kidding me ?
they said the alternator alone would cost $ _num_ , not including labor .
unbelievable .
check them out , they have _num_ stars on yelp .
i nailed my guy everytime he double talked me .
these are the best prices on town .
omg i 've worked soooo hard for you .

they said .
they add another $ _num_ .
i 'm completely exhausted dealing with the bs .
i might let a bus run me over before this deal ends !
tell him we 're coming in friday night after work .
he 's so overbearing and intimidating that my wife needs to step outside .
are you kidding me ?
so extremely disappointed .
all the customer service people were responsive , helpful , and courteous .
lots of waiting , then car is ready but scratches not fixed .
lots of talk , but very short on positive action .
horrible service .
rude service .
i do n't mind paying for services that are needed .
no more !
was there for _num_ hrs .
horrible experience !

so he gave me his card to call him tomorrow .
then we walked out .
umm how about having someone actually try to sell me a car ?
i had beg someone to even show me a car .
be weary of anything they have posted on their web site .
that way she could test the car out over the weekend .
first thing monday morning we go to the dealership .
close to _num_ hrs the first night plus _num_ hrs the next night .
twice .
not impressed .
i highly do n't recommend !
this place does n't even deserve one star .
i 'm disgusted .
do not trust these people .
the company really sucked !
if a driver spent too long there , the driver would get written up .
Neutral
no fake long conversations please .
do n't be fooled by the nice looking furniture .
i 've purchased ashley furniture before and was a happy customer .
the mall ring circle , henderson , nv delivered _num_ damaged pieces of furniture .
dont waste your money !
this was my second visit to this store in the last _num_ years .
my partner and i started playing cat and mouse and she fell for it .
i cant wait till i 'm done doing business with these morons .
i regret coming here .
- we 'd need to call customer service ( again ) on our own .
it felt more like passing the buck to get us out of the store .
overpriced ashley furniture ... ... some made in china .
it 's very frustrating !
worst location ever !
see ashley furniture sahara review for more details .
this company is garbage .
did anyone bother to apologize ?
they seem to always have delivery problems .
i guess that 's why you do n't tell us .
they will tell you anything to purchase and then it is your problem .
really limited selection : most items seemed really similar .
is there a _num_ star button ?
poor excuse for a business .
left extremely frustrated .
shady , shady , shady .
she took my insurance card and id and had me sit back down .
_num_ hour wait .
Negative
i wait all this time to go for my appointment , and now this .
she told me yes .
so slow !

this review is only based off of one experience from a non customer .
poor !
poor !
poor !
it was way too wide .
they made another sink which fit .
i would never use them again .
i said okay , i need it by that day .
morning came , nothing .
i explained i want this done quickly .
not so fast .
the pump is $ _num_ plus labor , tax etc !
big joe featured sandwich should be called `` little joe '' .
it 's been a long time since i 've been here .
really ... try them .
the order says that it comes with zucchini , artichokes and spinach .
will not visit this location again !
i do n't find that they skimp too , too much .
no bueno .
what a spectacular disappointment .
to call this place a deli is like calling mcdonald 's a burger joint .
not lukewarm .
cold .
ick .
i 'm always down for a bag of good kettle cooked potato chips .
bad idea .
this will however most definitely be the last time .
this was terrible !
i got a soup and salad combo , really basic .
i get down there and wait and wait and wait .
not so much .
none was met .
lots of play time rather than educational teaching .
not impressed .

here i am again _num_ months later with another billing issue .
i wish someone could get there shit together .
all the good teachers leave because they dont care about there staff .

a few days later we returned for breakfast burritos .
gross combination .
they are sloppy and careless .
no thanks .
no apology , no customer service .
terrible location .
my son and i resolved never to eat here again .
this location always takes a very long time to prepare your order .
this place is nothing like it .
not even close .
really hard to find taco shops here .
maybe the owners should check out this location because it really does suck !
but i do n't like pico de gallo .
this guy does n't wear gloves .
i sit down and eat it .
and it was terrible .
it 's the typical food that you would get from any other equal establishment .
some of the polish started to peel off later as a result .
not from here but needed a quick fill .
overall got another woman to get done what i needed .
she is the only one id trust .
a total wreck of a haircut .
also , tonight when we went there , the portion sizes actually got smaller .
on this occasion , i left hungry after we shared _num_ dishes .
i was so disappointed .
both were terrible .
i only needed two forks so that was good .
the mushrooms were cold .
i went in , stopped by the cashier and ordered my food .
out of the whole bowl , i consumed half a cup .
it actually made me wonder if it was chicken .
first , let me say i love me some pei wei .
i stood up and see my food sitting behind the register .
wo n't be back .
rude , rude , rude .
not acceptable to me .
so , i ordered the pad thai with chicken .
at this point i just gave up and left .
i will not be going back .
first time experiencing pei wei .
wo n't be returning .
the sushi was n't fresh .
disgusting food .
i have eaten here many times .
no problem right ?
the bowl has _num_ % of recommended sodium .
i finished neither .
in all you still end up with $ _num_ worth of meat .
disgusting !
so disappointed .
no flavor .

_num_ star .
edit : complaint filed with pei wei corporate .
none at all .
so gross !

horrible food .
pad thai look like it was food colored and the noodle stick together .

bad service .
my husband and i visited _num_ times .
the cashew chicken , which i ordered , was listed as slightly spicy .
been getting hit and miss food for the last few years .
i will not be back .
the staff members were very friendly and my order was finished quickly .
_num_ stars for service , _num_ star for the food ... `` meh .
i 've never experienced anything like it .
kinda a let down on this place .
but i do want to note again , that the staff were awesome .
the squid was more like a squid version of a chicken nugget !
the bathroom was clean , so there 's that .
the satay was deep fried .
it is cut up into small pieces and deep fried .
we will not eat here again .
went off reviews , gave it a shot .
extremely disappointed !
disappointed .
i mean lean cuisine worthy .
have eaten here a few times .
ca n't taste nothing .
it could just me : ) it could be good on your taste bud .
the pad thai my wife ordered was also a little off .
not my favorite .
went to `` the jewelers '' on eastern and they were awesome .
plus their diamonds were better quality and better priced !
i also paid for the watch protection plan that the salesman recommended .
i purchased the tag in _num_ .
not a good look .
how low can one go beyond that ?
i said to just get a trim off the ends .
# _num_ ) her : do you want it rounded or straight ?
me : long layers , whatever that is .
i went back and she was off .
worst experience ever .
i came in with long hair down to my butt .
i ended driving a mile away to ulta however , they were closing .
instead of telling me that they did back fills , she took them off .
first of all though , they did my pedicure .
not this place !
so , she starts to take off my nails using another nail tip .
i felt rushed though .
worst experience ever !
until _num_ days later my nails started cracking and lifting .
i could n't believe it !
my boyfriend and i went in for pedicures today around _num_ pm .
this place is horrible .
she does n't care .
why have a business if your just going to turn away good paying customers ?
i even had a coupon for $ _num_ off a cake .
wrong .
i ended up buying the lil cake which i couldnt use the coupon for .
just not worth it .
tuesday night at 8pm and only one person working ?
how would u forget something i asked you for and you said okay .
not happy .
now for the ugly .
it 's a gym , having working equipment is your # _num_ job .
unbelievable .
this is bs .
terrible customer service .
old equipment , most need repair .
there are plenty of better gyms in green valley area .
very disappointing .
it needs a total face lift and more qualified staff .
waste of money .
a little too pricey for salad .
for $ _num_ you can find dozens of better buffets .
i witnessed one kid touch every brownie on the tray before picking one .
but they should get rid of the premium toppings .
that does not seem right .
she even gave us coupons for a free visit .
it consisted of whole apples , grapes and oranges .
_num_ stars ?
seriously , it 's freakin cafeteria style food .
_num_ stars ?
bad .
limited choices of vegetables at salad bar at lunch .
the soup bar was messy .
we then ventured to get some bread and soup to go with our salad .
gross .
not worth paying for .
make your own salad better and for less !
i mean , really loud and crowded .
the desserts were just eh .
the brownie bites were rock hard at the edges .
today it was awful !
it tasted like dirt .
bad just bad !
so in summary the food tastes old .
was it too far away from lunch and dinner rush ?
i ca n't recommend this location .
worst ever .
poor customer service .
been the _num_ plus times .
for far less money .
or _num_ for _num_ .
hard to beat $ _num_ for _num_ .
my total was $ _num_ .
it was really crowded on a friday afternoon .
i almost died and they send me one gift card !
you have to ask yourself , this is a salad place right ?
walked out .

will not be back .
absolutely nothing gluten free .
we will not be visiting again .
big mistake .
mahi was dry .
crab cakes were mushy .
even shrimp in sushi is never that raw .
there was _num_ of us .
the waitress was typical , she came every once round every once and awhile .
wow , these little things are really expensive .
i was a mess !
they 're so many better seafood options in vegas .
the menu described it as shrimp and sausage with some spicy cajun seasoning .
the pot meal came with corn on the cob .
i had some sort of overpriced pot with crab legs and shrimp .
joe 's crab is to seafood as olive garden is to italian .
( a party of eight is an automatic _num_ % gratuity ) .
the hush puppies were good .
very disappointed .
all you get is _num_ ounces of soup , and that 's it !

on a good note , they refunded me for the room .
this location fails at that .
service was pretty crappy .

my reply was can you get a new chef in the kitchen .
when you are a large man , you need some room to breathe .
manager did not really care .
and for the cheeseburger meal off the kids menu _num_ .
i urge you not to give this place your business .
completely disappointing .
not so much .
but you can literally tell everybody hates working at this place .
that 's not ok .
service has been horrible !
it stinks .
never again will i return for dinner .
we walked out today .
you can only get one appetizer too .
it made me question why these restaurants were still around .

my other friend ordered her second drink and just never received it .
food : chicken was really dry .

everything else was bland .
our server would just drop items at our table and disappear almost as quickly .

horrible horrible horrible !
no beers .
no beers .
i went over to another table to get silverware and ketchup .

i travel to vegas regularly for work .
there were two long lines each going out either side .

super rude and stupid service !
we only stayed here because all hotels were booked for a convention .
we went on a comp 'd meal .
the food came and it looked generic .
foul play ?
shower bar was rusty and it needs replacement .
it was like laying on concrete .
my girlfriend and i decided to attend your 7pm bingo session .
lots of smoke and not the greatest floor layout .
they also have a burger king , pizza and buffet .
the bar does n't carry much variety .
i do n't remember seeing a roulette wheel .
another smoke filled hotel .
why bother with reservations !
it 's the smallest suite ever !
i booked a non-smoking room with _num_ king bed .
not impressed .
i was treated like i have been giving them trouble .
i was driving through and decided to spend a night here .
( jose ) he did little to correct the issue .
smokey , stinky and crowded oh my !
all were $ _num_ .

if you have the time , stop by and find out .
bring $ _num_ plus tax if you actually expect your oil changed .
Negative

no .
awful customer service .
bad customer service .
avoid this company !
_num_ hour waiting room wait for daughter 's appointment .
this is absolutely ridiculous !

this place is horrible !
for the doctor to fill out a half of a box .

disappointed .

not just the military members meal .
they gave me all the fixings to put my meal together .
it was tasty however the gave me chicken when i ordered beef .
once seated the waiter appeared quickly to take our drink order .
chips and salsa soon followed .
bland .
save some money , go to the del taco .
the service is hit or miss .
i 've never had any problems with the fuel desk staff .
as a truck driver it is a common stop for fuel .
this is a sketchy place .
anyway , they managed to pull it off .
over a month later and i 'm still sitting here waiting to hear something .
they drove it off the truck with all my furniture .
when they finally delivered our goods , so many things were smashed beyond repair .
stay way ... far away if you value your belongings .
tyler promises the world ... then you never hear from him again !
they really need a security guard here at night .
of course it 's not in there !
but they charge you to go to your car and get your registration .
if it 's not in there , then your $ hit out of luck !
nothing , if you want your car !
i called on wednesday to purchase a fuel pump .
i offered to go pick it up .
they were gon na check on that and get back to me .
i 'm like well it 's sitting here i need it ok .
i wanted to like this place .
bad .
that 's why i took off another star .
we came in at sat at the bar .
my friend , she was drinking her drinks .
but i was putting tips in the g strings .
matter of fact , i 've been to better strip clubs in mexico .

he 's nothing .
!
so this is a mom and pop place in a not so great neighborhood .
very amateur decor .
the bulgogi was just ok .
horrible location .
lousy service .
i just left .
anywhere else you can go would be cheaper .
seriously .
not even a hello .
very rude .
does diet coke sound like regular root beer ?
next time if i have to stop here ill just use the drive thru .
no way !
btw everything is expensive here which i do n't mind paying .
he was polite enough to take off both drinks for us and apologized .
while the food was great , the service was , not so much .
the only waitress was at the counter eating and reading the newspaper .
the chef was very heavy on the salt !
bad choice .
only one other table of customers besides us .
everything was not done properly .

they kept trying to leave things asking if we were sure we wanted it .
i really ca n't say that i care for this place , at all .

eater beware !
they brought out some tostadas , crackers , lime , and salsa .

your spending a lot of money there for the waitress to ignore you .
the food is average , i 've had better .
service was bad .
this is probably the last visit here from us .
just thinking about the food is making my stomach hurt .
super disappointed .
that sucked .
what a total disappointment .
so sad !
wo n't be back .
i was very dissapointed in this place .
the service was horrible .
the fish tacos were super greasy as were the chips that accompanied the guacamole .
this place is not authentic mariscos .
not worth the hype .
food is n't that great .
do n't recommend it .
ridiculous .
ridiculous .
horrible !
this really upset me because min .
i know _num_ person there spoke a touch of english .
very disappointed .
?
just saying you guys should think twice before paying for overpriced food here .
my large shrimp cocktail seemed as if i was having cold shrimp soup .
the food was only so-so .
leave early and communicate .
bad decision .
if u hate your job , quit .
it seems like everyone at this school is an idiot .
i mean seriously learn to expand .
graduation rate is beyond low .
customer service is terrible .
the real problem here is the customer service skills and people skills .
sign at the door said experience is not necessary .
my husband and i purchased a garage door from the home depot .
_num_ days later !

we received horrible service .
even if i were a smoker i would want to use a clean tray .
the bathroom was so dim , i thought there was a blown light bulb .

then the down fall .
when i was finished 1/4 of the plate was onions i had pulled out .

the badger 1/3 horse power .
home depot is _num_ .
come on home depot , do n't become walmart .
stick with the customer service you were built on and promise today .
btw home depot , lowes did it .
from now on my business goes to lowe 's .
lowe 's always gives a full _num_ % , even on clearance items .

join another club .
this store has cleaned up a lot since the last time i was here .
i looked for something online , the site said it was in stock here .

overall , this walmart could be better .
i feel like i 'm in the ghetto when i come here .

in my opinion shop at some other wal-mart !

horrible customer service !

she did a quick job and not a great job .
i am so fed up .
a woman by the name of rose called me over to her work station .
worst nail place ever !
the food was ok .
the building is ran down and easy to miss .
just an old beat up hole in the wall .
chicken , pork , and shrimp fried rice .
the chicken tasted kind of questionable .
on the other hand the red curry was very yummy .
the prices were pretty typical for takeout .
the last couple of times i 've gone my orders have been messed up .
it was not to busy .
do n't go to this location !
horrible service !
not a single one had been greeted or acknowledged .
not ok .
horrible !
its not a corporate policy just the shady pizza joint down on the corner .

not the greatest tonight the quality is just a bit off .
it smelled rotten .
no it was n't .
i think it was a giant portobello mushroom with spinach .
usual service was good for the establishment .
i had the honey pepper steak and the wife had the honey chicken shrimp .
the honey really overpowered the dish .
the steak was cooked how i ordered .
the onions and jalapeos were smothered in the honey syrup .
i just cant give it more than _num_ stars .
it taste overly processed and standard .
seems everytime we come here experience varies tremendously .
a shame .
now my guest ordered a strawberry , chicken , avocado .
_num_ little pieces of strawberries .
chicken was tasty , but the spinach in the salad was brown and wilted .
that is why for the _num_ stars .
i i was hoping it at least would taste good .
bad service !

my husband 's order was never put in .
by this time our group was almost done eating .

they 're just slow .
we ordered _num_ steak entrees .
no bueno .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
really are you kidding me !
to top it all , they forgot my chicken fries .
they are n't doing breakfast right now .
your prices are ridiculous !
if the prices were more competitive they would get more business .
ok no big deal .
ok that 's it i 'm livid .
so this last go round with them is why i am writing this review .
big mistake .
i 'm thinking like ok what does that mean .
well i went back and talked to a manager .
this is a management problem .
i never recieved a phone call .
over all gross .
i make better tuna sandwiches @ home than this place does .
could not get .
we will not try again.
well , your driver just cost you a customer .
very poorly run .
needless to say , i kept walking .
they really failed !
so frustrating !
it 's just not o.k .
in my book to lie more then once to a customer .
their sandwiches just miss .

another bust as far as golf goes in henderson .
no tie at all .
plain & simple .
my young daughter picked out some trendy polish for her nails & toes .
last time i checked , the client picks whatever they like .
i was really upset that my daughter was treated this way .
i will be making the drive to north vegas to my favorite salon .

i 'm not going back ever again .
$ _num_ nails that were worth $ _num_ .
rip off !
i agree that dr .
the nurse who takes the temp , weight and measurements could be more friendly .
she was very helpful and addressed all my concerns .
i 've switched doctors after this last visit .
i could n't believe it .
a _num_ minute phone call for a simple question !
_num_ prescriptions were to be sent to the pharmacy .
no call back .
wow crap service .
horrible horrible place .
we frequent mcdonalds quite often with a little _num_ year old .
with so many people out of work mcdonalds could have hired a friendly person .
how difficult is it to just put what was ordered , in the bag ?
ick !
idiots .
gave me pickles .
anyway , going through this guard gate is always a pain .
the service was adequate , but spotty .
strangely , we watched as he went to every table but ours .
my wife and i tried this place with a groupon .
the menu in simple and limited , which is usually a good thing .
i had the veal and my wife had butternut squash ravioli .
almost too good .
the thing that upset me was the bill .
they added a group gratuity of almost ten dollars to the bill .
too bad for them .
i live in henderson nv where this restaurant is .
nothing special .
this was more like a linguini with mixed seafood .
that made our $ _num_ worth only $ _num_ .
maybe she should hire better waiters .
for an upscale italian restaurant we expected much more .
stop trying to upsell me on what i want to eat for food .
maybe just a mistake .
the food was average and the dinning room was really loud .
the communication between both is where i think we fell through the crack .
Negative
very disappointing .
Negative
she is very rude .
menu is boring .
i see why only a few tables were filled on a friday night .
way better options in henderson !

Neutral
_num_ ) .
their prices are outrageous for the portions , too .
$ _num_ bucks for spaghetti and meatballs .
this place is not authentic and it is simply over priced .
ambience is lackluster .
we were wrong .
horrible service .
wo n't be returning .
made me and my wife feel very unwelcome .
the olds , just meant more talking during the movie .
not appropriate and if i was their manager i would be sending them home .
disappointed with an unorganized theatre .
the screen is mediocre .
wish they were all _num_ mm .
it had an inch and a half of space left when he recieved it .
the theater was n't packed .
the theaters are old .
not just women 's bags .
she said she 'd take my info and contact me if they found it .
pointing down to my girlfriend 's foot .
cilantro is nasty .
always disappointed here !
all of which seem to be staples , but are never well stocked .
third , they seem to always be out of something .
the parking lot ... is super tight to get in and out of .
_num_ star .
i always enjoy chipotle but had an odd experience at this one .
my wife ordered a bowl with beef and the girl put chicken .
with many chipotle locations throughout las vegas , do n't choose this one .
to long of a wait , employees complaining `` where did everyone go ? ''
poor management .
this location is horrible .
this location however disappoints me .
the las vegas boulevard location is way better .
every single one of them agree that it is not mexican at all .
i highly suggest this location to be looked at by the health department .
not sure .
last time for example , i got a chicken burrito and added sour cream .
but out of food last two times .
seems the employees need to learn a bit about customer service .
i tried the one on eastern .
not kidding about that .
there has been rock hard black stuff in my burritos .
the rice al dente every day the salsas pre packaged .
disappointed .
the worst experience ever .
and i got chicken in my bowl .
then a girl continued my bowl .
here 's a new one for me i have never reviewed a convenience store .
my case was put before a supervisor named donna .
this branch gets very little foot or vehicle traffic .
they are a dime a dozen in henderson .
they are lazy and incompetent .
the wait time is really quick .
but so is your visit .
i am very disappointed .
so you 'll never have lunch there on a weekend .
no clue why .
no booths .
prob will not visit here again .
hard to believe the ratings .
servers were very stressed and we left all stressed out .
we brought the kids , _num_ and _num_ .
guess ranch is expensive as well ?
eh ?
meh , meh , meh .
( in my eyes and taste buds at least ) .
this time i ordered the most basic ; pepperoni pizza .
went in to use my buy one get one _num_ % off .
imagine _num_ % oil , _num_ % vinegar .
the sausage and mushroom rigatoni was subpar .
it was n't even that busy !
ordered s medium pizza with sausage mushroom and anchovies .
it 's a shame .
will not be back .
very little cheese as well .
this is an updated review this was sold to new owners .
so completely different nothing tasted the same .
the old owners family biz are long gone .
he brought our drinks ( glass of house merlot $ _num_ ) .
we then had salad and bread which were good .
do not come here for lunch .
not homemade , not flavorful .
got boring real quick .
sauce was bland .
bad choice .
so , back to my original statement .
poor form .
tried this place for lunch for the first time .
also , the portions are rather small for an italian restaurant .
if you 're not familiar , daily chef makes tons of different frozen foods .
i did n't even finish it .
just another bummer .
low quality taste in food
drink refills very hard to come by .
drive home took approximately _num_ seconds .
are you kidding me ?
how difficult is it to fuck up a chicken fried steak ?
all of it not good !
we started off with the bottomless chips and salsa .
so very tasteless !
she said no problem .
this is horrible service .
very disappointed .
had the _num_ for $ _num_ deal .
the wait staff works as `` teams '' .
what a dumb idea .
the sweet potato fries did come out without salt , as i requested .
we did n't see him much .
it said nowhere on the coupon dine in only .
it was weird .
it was gross .
wait staff was awesome .
we are handed menus , and wait .
terrible service .
was not pleased at all .
the burger was nothing special .
wo n't be returning .
service was ridiculously slow .
apologetic for the long wait .
seems like their kitchen needs to work on getting the food out faster .
very disappointing .
someone walked by from the wait staff and we mentioned it .
the food is always great .
my waiter seemed out of it as well .
the service was atrocious !
it 's really unfortunate .
it 's sad .
when our waiter came over we ordered two beers .
_num_ .
i will not be returning .
not impressed .
absolutely horrible experience tonight .
i did however still leave the waitress a tip .
the food is always great .
my waiter seemed out of it as well .
service is terrible .
i 've held off on reviewing my last couple of visits .
i 'm not coming back .
no management presence .
i was disgusted .
just terrible .
then we returned to our booth as i saw the kitchen .
kinda silly since they have chicken sandwich and hotdog , etc .
i ordered a foot long hot dog .
no grill .
no burgers .
do n't call yourself a dairy queen and not carry the hamburgers .
it 's false advertising .
yikes , the memories of dq .

super busy and staff always seem overwhelmed .
seriously , would it kill them to change out the oil ?
what a mess .
after making my pumpkin blizzard .
next after asking for whip they forgot the pumpkin spice .
the male cashier talked down about a fellow employee to a customer as well .
when i inquired about it , he told me because the weather was hot ?
ick !
does this place have management ?
there 's no drive-thru .
it 's a bit rundown and not particularly clean looking .
they never seem to have any ice cream cakes available .
my strawberry shake is very on point though .
terrible !
i see why it 's b rated .
she insisted not to .
terrible location .
ordered : midnight truffle blizzard cake with white writing .
food is okay but the store itself is rundown .
where has customer service gone ?
i walked in the door and all _num_ stylist were with clients .
i sat down to wait .
never asked if i needed anything .
left with a bloody ear and cut on the other side of my head .
oh well .
big ripoff !
they take short cuts and then ignore you after they have your money !
disappointing .
we asked for low maintenance and our landscaping has been anything but that .
i will not go back .
i got the deluxe pedicure cuz my feet really needed it .
the massage was n't that good .
i could get a mani paid for that price normally !
gel was cracking .
never going back again !
is the doctor even a doctor , are the nurses even nurses ?

the total was $ _num_ .
it was terrible .
like none at all .

hot wings were disgusting .
not very impressed .
the crust tastes like something you would get from a bargain frozen pizza .
disappointed .
we have been coming to this location since _num_ .
it was my first experience with chicago style pizza .
we never see the same server twice , ever .
no fried zucchini ?
the groupon was for a total value of $ _num_ .
maybe we 've never had a chicago style pizza before !
we ordered a _num_ '' thin crust with pepperoni , sausage & mushrooms .
unacceptable service !
this is how restaurants lose customers .
i paid $ _num_ extra for nothing .
very disappointed !
she made it very obvious !
such a shame !
take your money elsewhere !
and our guests have to sleep on the couch and floor .
the drinks are cheaper at inn zone down the street .
the food is better at stadium grille across the street .
totally bad mistake .
it was sooo loud !
just walked out of this place .
she offered me a box so i could shake the rub on myself .
she gave me a credit for the next visit .
zero .
_num_ people in dinning room .
thank god for finger foods .
very poor service .
not a fan of this location .
the food was subpar each time i 've been .
what a disappointment .
then a waiter said they would , and another waiter confirmed .
pathetic .
hot chick got served quickly as well as everyone else around the bar .
yeah not so well .
except the two girls in the dining area setting up napkins and utensils .
i get there and my grilled chicken sandwiches turned into buffalo ranch chicken sandwiches .
you talk crap after ?
you are serving chicken wings , not gold nuggets .
will not be finding out .
not worth the expense .
are you kidding me ?
i threw them away .
the beer was cold .
ugh .
but alas , it never is .
the only things i can tolerate here are the appetizers .
( _num_ bartenders ) both passed me a few times each .
our family of _num_ went to dine .
food is mediocre .
terrible customer service !
nothing like being given a happy hour menu after happy hour is over .
the appetizers were cold .
horrible experience !
all i ate were fries and a beer .
it was so terrible .
do not give them your time .
will not recommend to anyone .
get a better take out employee or a better phone line .
wing stop is going to be go to for wings for now .
fail .
but not on this tuesday evening .
you practically have to grab the server every time you want something .
no thanks !
it 's like buying a _num_ ounce coke , and only getting _num_ ounces .
the place was a little busy .
they checked and it was n't .
they just not good .
they place was kinda messy .
unacceptable .
too bad .
he did n't look happy .
we just relocated back to henderson and my wife was looking for a doctor .
so my boyfriend stops here to get his haircut after seeing the positive reviews .
if you choose to go here be sure to wait for someone else .
same store , same prescription .
ugh .
i miss walgreens !
_num_ ) `` it 's a pharmacy product '' .
why not take me back to the pharmacy for the return ?
but your experience might be different .
never even acknowledged .
we asked him why this was required and he said this was the law ?
i guess wisdom does n't always come with age .
some people get off work late and need to go grocery shopping then .
this smiths never has anyone available to you when you need them .
my prescription is sitting on the shelf .
total visits during past _num_ years ?
total visits during past _num_ months ?
this is just not good enough .
i doubt i will go back .
mickey rico will shake your hand while going straight for your wallet .
this is my experience and i dont care how anyone else feels about him .
i have an extremely simple haircut .
but its kind of like being dropped off by a cab downtown .
probably not .
he gave me a second mirror to check the back of my hair .
when my turn came up , i approached the available barber .
why the heck had i been waiting ?
such has not been my experience .
i 'd give this place a _num_ if i could .
not for me .
absolute garbage .
the overall hair cut is what makes this review a _num_ stars .
so my advice is = call before making a trip to the shop .
i 've been a loyal customer for about _num_ years now .
the service was excellent , but the drinks are not my favorite .
i just like simple all fruit smoothies .
i walked in and met the utmost rudest employee ever .
this guy needs to be fired big time .
i went there earlier today to get a smoothie and a flatbread .
_num_ people came in after me and placed orders as i waited for flatbread .
i will drive a little farther to get better service .
ah , yes ... tropical smoothie .
employees were very rude .
having loud conversations about being hungover .
not great for a tropical smoothie .
bathroom was disgusting .
skip this one .
i normally like tropical smoothie .
really horrible experience !
worst experience !
terrible late night service .
there was a group outside and a group inside sitting at tables .
basically does n't say a word to me except my total .
it 's awful .
employee looked very stressed .
same non service for the man that came in afterwards .
the smoothie tasted different than the previous times i 've had them too .
employees always seem stressed out because they are overworked and understaffed !
get with your manager & complain cause this is a constant problem .
i counted three associates so that was interesting to me .
mind you , this has been in the morning during peak smoothie business hours .
you clearly have the traffic so get some more competent employees .
we were n't having it , because i took work off to be there .
now , i 'm looking for a new vet .
apparently it had died unexpectedly on the operating table .
that was disgusting .
obviously , we never stepped foot inside oasis animal hospital again .
very long lives for large breed dogs .
you owe it to your pet , to get a second opinion .
wish i could post the pics .
unbelievable .
price was $ _num_ .
called two other places and these prices are 4-5 x more than industry rates .
two thumbs down .
just ate here tonight .
everything was so soggy !
will not go back .
_num_ .
quality of fish is near rock bottom .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i ordered the lunch bento box with broiled unagi and grilled salmon .
the other sushi rolls we had were pretty good , interesting custom rolls .
not the yum yum i was hoping for .
like i said , the sauces are make or break for me .
nothing excited me here .
the soup just tastes like soy sauce .
teppanyaki ... ribeye was tough .
i could name two other teppanyaki places that i like better .
tonight was a different story .
unbelievable .
_num_ our usual party of five showed up for my sons birthday .
looks like it 'll be a while before i decide to return here !
i just find it generic .
the menu is out of control .
my companion raved about this restaurant for quite some time .
i lost my appetite .
not many people in the restaurant .
there was an older chef george who was cooking for us .
we ordered _num_ fried rice .
this is unbelievable .
bad hygiene .
disappointing service tonight .
when we presented the groupon , the server stated they do take any groupons .
which was confusing since we purchased the groupon for that specific location .
terrible customer service !
customer service was terrible !
showed up last night with a groupon for the teppanyaki dinner for _num_ .
he does n't deserve it .
needless to say , i was upset with how she handled the situation .
i will not go back again !
i will not be going back .
no attention to detail .
i went there tonight to celebrate my birthday .
the service was awful .
i mean , what sushi establishment does that ?
unbelievably horrible !
fish is not fresh .
tastes like freezer burn .
the one i used to frequent was the sahara location .
ordered a number _num_ through the drive thru .
its been a long time since i ate jacks .
hats off to you my dear .
not my favorite place .
not the best ayce sushi place in vegas .

hot when received .
- beef teriyaki was tough .
oh man , fail .
- dynamite was good .
_num_ onion .
_num_ cucumber .
terrible .
it 's not as fresh .
the chef was friendly and therefore i give some stars .
the seaweed salad was straight out of a package .
the menu is minimal for nigiri and rolls .
i am reviewing on my visit this morning .
this was my stop before dmv .
so i walked out .
visit from hell .
then i walked out .
not worth the $ _num_ .
pharmacy department could improve on getting things filled correctly .
wooden window blinds are completely covered in dust .
you know the kind , with the little shredded carrots in it .
it was stale .
it was gross .
this place is very overrated .
so i just left .
the burger was disgusting !
my fatburger days are officially over .
for shame !
that would be a stretch to say that .
ugh .
there 's a few selections here that fall into the fast food category .
my only real complaint is the inflated prices .
today was our first time at green valley ranch location thanks to groupon .
what a let down this place is !
if you 've been to fatburger before you know how juicy there burgers are !
i recently returned and placed the same order for a large fatburger medium rare .
it was my first experience eating a fatburger and probably my last .
the skinny fries were good .
it had the number _num_ written on the bag !
horrible customer service .
the pork was awful .
the rice was terrible .
it 's just terrible .
if you 're hungry and need a quick bite i guess it 'll do .
i refuse to return .
yuck yuck yuck .
)
_num_ .
you can choose it with either sour cream or guacamole ... same price .
so i said whatever .
overall , the prepared food is typical of most other fast mexican food joints .
no discount .
there is nothing i can do about it . ''
no discount .
i completely hate this place .
i can never find the stuff i need , and _num_ .
like , o m g , the world is going to end .
i hate grocery shopping .
the fruit was not that good .
you ca n't go in the back and get me one .
dreadful !
so cheap .
skip this place !
i said no thanks .
nothing done to speed things up .
service has totally slipped at _num_ hills vision .
ok , i need the contacts so i wait .
if not i know i can find another eye doctor next year .
so disappointed ... .
terrible .
i then selected frames , that needed to be ordered .
they made living there very difficult !
they nickel and dime you to death .
worse apartment management ever !
the worst moving experience !
why are we having so many problems ?
now i know why there is a high turn over of apartments here .
not to say it 's ridiculously overpriced as it is .
my normal stylist was out for this week .

i was given paperwork to complete .
i did not get it done .
avoid this location !
very short staffed , room is full of people in the same boat .
a most miserable experience .
i have been waiting for _num_ min .
dominos ... pizza hut ... papa john 's ... it 's all the same .
i understand you get busy , i can accept that .
it 's been a week , we have heard nothing from this store .
avoid this location .
when i got there one of the staff was putting toppings on some pizzas .
i understand being busy , but a four month wait for a standard cleaning ?
in vegas much nicer courses for less cost .
kelly the snack cart attendant was awesome .
really ruined the day .
worst pizza ever !
service is horrible !
same thing happened again the next time i went there .
i ordered pizza .
very cheap .
cheap but disgusting .
still the worst .
i was sadly mistaken .
is it really that hard to have some quality behind your brand ?
feast your eyes on this pizza ... search for better .
you would think at dinner time they prepare more pizzas !
terrible service !
no apologies , poorly managed !
the pizza there is always cooked just right and the bread sticks are yummy .
that 's unacceptable .
should n't you have pizza ready .
i tried going two more times , tonight being the last time .
there must be a better way to treat your paying patients ( customers ) !
the staff that day needs special training in patients care .
Negative
it is a disgrace .
i can not believe it .
stay away from this location .
zero stars !
the window in my bedroom had a draft which easily raised my electric bill .
what the heck ?
just be ready to give up your $ _num_ security deposit .
avoid at all cost !
average wait time _num_ hours .
staff scheduling appt .
do n't rent from here under any circumstances .

i left and will never go back .
but no .
$ _num_ dollars !
are you kidding me ?
my final price was $ _num_ dollars .
still expensive , but better than $ _num_ .
overall , beware of unnecessary testing .
and do n't let them `` scare '' you into it .
i feel this hospital really needs to realize who pays their bill .
terrible service .
was not impressed with this place .
in the room vet asked what i needed .
i was pissed .
i went out to check out and waited .
she looked at my checkout told me total .
for every one client that leaves another will replace me .
i would highly doubt that they did .
also wish the front office staff was more efficient and nicer .
excuse me ?
pretty sad pizza place .
i loaded up the family and the free ice cream coupons .
a little over priced if you ask me .
horrible customer service !
terrible owners !
absolutely ridiculous !

terrible experience .
not even worth one star !
ridiculous !

i sincerely doubt this business will last til the fall .
ended up sitting while other people were taken .
terrible customer service .
for their prices , i would chose a better salon .
the heck bro !
so i had to stop it .
i came in with my cousin .
it was absurd .
do n't yell at your customers in front of other ( new ) customers .
i 'm not exaggerating .
wasted my time .
horrible service !
we walked in and they exchanged looks .
did n't even get a greeting .
but this location is in serious need of organization .
really bad !
a total rip off .
it 's not only basic common courtesy , but basic manners .
cheaper than whole foods , but not by much .
this store needs a major makeover .
very rude !
admittedly , this is on the nicer end too .
the staff is not super friendly .
horrible customer service .
utter failure .
this would make me not return .
rude , .
rude .
the bleu cheese dressing is good .
not too much else stands out .

my husband has been seeing him for approximately _num_ years .
he is n't worthy of even a _num_ .
still not good enough .
these people are horrible !

i already had my jeans in my hand and asked for my jacket back .
the worst !
are you kidding me ?
this is n't service !
and no !
hours are wrong .
disappointing .
Neutral
it was just my personal experience .
horrible !
by the way , the nurse 's name is sam .
return to work with restrictions that prevent her from doing her job ?
really , workers comp gives one little choice .
it was bland & flavorless .
my husband 's lasagna might has well been tomato soup with some noodles .
we were recently in henderson staying at the green valley ranch resort .
there are literally hundreds of other places to go with better service .
we each put $ _num_ in a machine .
halfway through the food we finally got asked if we would like refills .
we will not be back !
it smells like an old blueberry hill or some sort of old buffet chain .
most of the guests were older as well .
not a young soul as far as i could tell .
through our entire meal the server kept asking if we wanted more bread .
no means no !
the salads were nothing special .
i ordered a pasta in creamy tomato sauce .
not good .
yes a horse .
sooooo bad .
the sauce sucked .
service slow .
no thank you .
so they would be sending me to collections .
goat cheese crusted in nuts .
ordered chicken _num_ ways .
a little dry .
chicken ravioli actually did have some flavor which was a shock .
steak was dry .
could have cooked a better sauce at home blind folded .
rude .
i 'm really disappointed .
another chain bites the dust .
carrabba 's used to me and my husbands favorite places to eat .
he could not taste the cheese .
too bad too .
very , very disappointed .
they removed my favorite appetizer ( shrimp scampi ) from the menu .
when it arrived , it was tiny little shrimp , gummy , not seared .
they removed my husbands favorite dish ( seafood cannelloni ) .
they raised prices & reduced sizes !
worst branch .
there was a clothing plastic tag in my salad .
very uncomfortable dining experience .
just not worth a return visit .
the waitress saw that my crab cake was completely black on the bottom .
the bartender there greeted us as we walked in .
my problem is with the service .
( i was not ) .
i have never been rushed so much in my life .
they could have just given us _num_ checks for each free entrees .
the server rushed us .
wo n't be back .
walked in we were the only ones there .
a party of _num_ came in after us then a party of _num_ .
everyone was seated , except us .
he was very apologetic and sincerely wanted to make my meal correctly .
the noodles were noticeably drowned in alfredo sauce .
i advised emily .
emily brought out the bill , but my meal was never addressed .
i 'm very unhappy .
first , forgot one of the entrees in our to-go order .
just wish that it had been cooked properly the first time it came out .
it was just ok .
it was stuffed with shrimp and blue cheese instead of brie from the menu .
it tasted so bad !
only patrons are drinking at the bar !
we had two drinks that were unusual .
no luck .
my wife ordered a caesar salad with chicken .
the cheap $ _num_ prime rib dinners downtown are better .
the food was horrible .
this was my 2nd time here .
Neutral
i 'd totally understand if the restaurant was packed .
but it is was n't .
they tasted fishy & gross .
never again .
why only _num_ stars then ?
there appears to be high turnover with regards to wait staff .
no employees in sight .
she said yes , say us , and was our server again .
service was atrocious .
had to wait an unreasonable amount of time again to get the jelly .
come here for phil ... not the food !
he was very condescending .
it is too bad !
a bowls of new england clam chowder was the size of a cup .
the worst dinner ever !
so disappointing .
a little pricey for what was served .
but to me they way overcharge for the rice .
help , we need a new sushi home !
had _num_ rolls and _num_ orders of sushi between _num_ of us .
fishy equals not fresh !
i have never experienced anything like it .
total waste .
so really need better planning .
wo n't be back .
terrible service !
two times , too many !
this food is terrible .
do n't be fooled find the real thing .
subpar would be an exaggeration .
bad choice .
the staff was very rushing it was overcrowded .
terrible .
the rolls tasted like mayonnaise .
only come here if you want mayo with a side of rice .
gross .
i was unimpressed .
it 's busy , i get it .
as there were more employees than guest , kinda strange .
would not recommend .
we ordered the poke , the screaming orgasm , and an eel role .
ordered sushi for lunch take out .
was expecting good sushi due to the reviews but it was just so-so .
did not care for it .
tried giving i love sushi another chance , and left less than impressed .
p.s .
in the past they have been ok , but pushy to get us out .
we were very disappointed .
luckily i only ordered sashimi !
style over substance .
poor saki selection .
sloppy preparation .
never going back .
very loud .
not my cup of tea !
they took away my cucumbers before i had finished them .
smelled terrible !
initially we had chosen to eat at this place solely based on yelp reviews .
boy was i wrong .
i have been trying something new lately , spray tan .
not only do i have spots everywhere , i have an orange tint .
consider yourself warned .
i went to tan las vegas for a little over a year .
terrible customer service quality .
very rude .
quality and taste of food is adequate to corporate taco bell standards .
do n't bother !
horrible .
i 've seen the process of the drink and it 's not rocket science .
maybe the staff is too young ?
not a good sign !
for what you pay , you are getting cafeteria food .
to that end , you are probably paying too much .
my father in law fell for it though and ordered an appetizer .
gross .
service is kinda slow .
i would probably hit a drive thru before coming back here for a sit-down .
way too much salad dressing .
are you kidding me ?
oh , but applebee 's is frozen food , right ?
i 'm glad applebees got rid of her .
it was full of chicken , bacon and cheese .
it really was n't great .
needless to say i did n't eat anymore .
service here really lacked .
overheard gentleman next to us send back his food .
a different waitress listens to our complaints and handles it quickly and nicely .
made me really uncomfortable .
we sit down and are greeted by the server .
i might as well have been invisible .
but service is terrible !
honestly , they seem really under staffed .
the waitresses are running around like chickens with their heads cut off .
someone needs to get on par with staffing and managing .
food is mediocre .
i ordered the to go _num_ times from here .
_num_ waters , a sprite , and a margarita .
we ordered my daughter a grilled cheese , which thankfully came out quickly .
had to ask _num_ different people for buffalo sauce .

first it was sunday at 7:30 and the restaurant had 15-20 people .
my husband had _num_ cheese macaroni with chicken tenders .
had a gift card from xmas so decided i better use it , lol .
this was last week sometime .
i looked in bag but nothing burning .
no spices .
they were zucchini , yellow squash , and red bell pepper .
this place needs customer service lessons !
i got the fiesta chopped chicken salad .
worst experience ever .
irritating .
i was prescribed this by my doctor .
i thought that this was something only a doctor or pharmacist could tell me .
[ why can i fill it if it is too soon ? ]
when he put down the phone he said sue me , ill sue you .
i 'm afraid for anyone comes to this pharmacy .
this place is awful .
no complaints . )
not very organized .
as others have said , the staff , not so much .
we will not be coming back .
unacceptable .
i would find another dr in heartbeat if my wife would allow it .
waiting an hour each time is too much .

i can make better hot dogs at home .
horrible drive thru !
he mentioned that the wait time was about an hour and a half .
he discounted me some $ _num_ .
no tv .
just saying rip off !
i was just here today to get an oil change and tire rotation .
all they could say was an oil change can do that .
hit or miss .
i said oil change please , he said where 's you car ?
worthless bunch .
i just gave in and let her call in the prescription to my pharmacist .
luckily the pharmacist knew my allergies and called to double check the prescription .
finally , she kicked him in the head .
this place is garbage !
the office staff here need training in customer service .
they are rude and unprofessional .
horrible customer service .
will never spend another cent at this dump .
after i went for my mri i went back into get my results .
the new doctor also did x-rays and discovered there was a problem .
worst experience ever !
then he 'd go back to his sushi chef and make comments in japanese .
i will not be back .
sashimi salad was a little on the spicy side .
are you kidding me ?

hence _num_ start rating .
she also , said that she would only charge 1/2 price for the comforter .
ok , picked up the two items , yes they were ready on time .

stupid .
there really are people in vegas who do n't smoke .
cost over $ _num_ .

i was just laughing inside cause i kinda know this is bullshit .
the lobster taco is o.k .

a big sale later i 'm on my way to my vision .
i 'm particularly not fond of the young guy working at the cutting table .

even the bookstore is gone .
that is why i 'm here . ''

i was there one visit for _num_ and a half hours .

there were at most 30-40 patrons in the place at this time .
well i am thinking it was this place in _num_ .

it was that bad .
but i feel that i was unwelcome guest from his sound of voice .
they were pissed .
when i mentioned something about it , they insisted she was adjusted .
they claimed i needed a new radiator and quoted approximately $ _num_ .
i 'm never going back !
he saved me $ _num_ .
about 1-2 weeks after the oil change , my service light went on .
big mistake .
i called auto tech immediately and told then what was going on .
i have been getting oil changes and work done here for some time .
very frustrated !
greedy money hungry place !
so , i really need glasses even when i walk .
and not to worry .
only that she would take it up with administration .
wait time was long , but not unexpected .
the bathroom was dingy , but everything else looked clean enough .
se replied `` three days '' very short in her tone .
please try not to take your stress on other people .
extremely bad service .

how pathetic !
however , next time i went into the office she was sweet as pie .
overall i never felt my questions were addressed and i felt rushed every appointment .
this guy only wants money money money .
awful , awful .
then we go to blood being drawn , and possibly changing up meds .
ok , by this time my patience is gone .
over _num_ years of loyalty to this man and he drops her ?
hopefully this helps someone to make a better decision than i did .
i ca n't find a single soul that can help me now .
first of all , they treated me like an idiot .
there are other situations that have happened , but this one really gets me .
just horrible .
my bite has been permanently changed because of this .
they were wrong again .
no thanks .
_num_ .
not so much on appliances .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
more misses .
_num_ .
_num_ .

as i walked in , a couple of sales associates approached me .
every time i stopped , he 'd make a comment about the couch .
maybe because of the way i was dressed .
i looked around and they were talking with each other as i walked through .
does anyone know where i can get theater seats ?
we had so much problem purchase our flooring here .
furniture , electronics , appliances and flooring in one location ?
( me ) is there anyway we could have it shipped earlier ?
next salesperson we met in dining section .
staff is horrible here !
no , nothing !
their return policy is _num_ days .
pathetic .
horrible customer service !
no thanks .
poor customer service !
she could n't help you ?
maybe you should hire people like me .
from the henderson location to north vegas ?
wrong !
this company really cares about their customers ' .
they deserve no stars .
both pieces were delivered damaged .
every contact with customer service has been less the positive .
once they began building the bed frame they quickly stopped and called me upstairs .
could n't pass it up .
big mistake .
i couldnt believe that was the response from a customer service agent .
this place is ridiculous .
they had some nice quality items , however , it was quite pricey .
before you attempt to shop here , know your prices .
not a big deal right ?
it 's not covered .
the have let me down everytime i have purchased from them .
adam , buy right appliance has been out twice now ... .
where does this stand ?
i considered it and i went back and selected a _num_ foot couch .
basic customer service would extend a call !
i will not go back .
after many attempts the store manager returned my phone call about this .
_num_ months ago i bought patio furniture .
service is crap .
to any customers looking to try this furniture store stop while your still ahead !
cost $ _num_ for _num_ years .
i 'll buy on amazon next time .
pickup process unbelievably slow .
terrible !
_num_ star customer service by everyone i talked to .
no business .
extremely poor customer service !
the salesman was very helpful and i might add happy for our purchase .
disappointed and frustrated .
i would go into more depth but i think i made my point .
never call your salesman back , he 's just a salesman .
delivery was thursday , july _num_ .
she transferred me to the henderson department .
really unhappy !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
why else treat people this way ?
it 's a nightmare !
very disappointed .
i 'm totally disappointed .
_num_ stars to the rest of the staff and facility itself .
to which the guy said , oh please , you 'll be back .
i 've been here _num_ times .
and old grease .
my uncle ordered beef with broccoli .
finally , my uncle asked our service for change , in ones .
to put it simply , i have never had such a lengthy sushi experience .
ridiculous .
worst all-you-can-eat sushi !
rotten fish !
the service was horrible !
i spend a lot of money in there at least twice a week .
julie the food server and the mexican older busboy are the only bright spots .
the worst !
this restaurant was terrible .
panda express does better then this restaurant .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
we do not recommend this place .
service was not that great .
more or less , made me feel like i was cheap .
rip off 's !
not too thrilled with this location .
no charge .
hell .
she never gave me eye contact .
very cold .
rude and cold again .
now i 'm on the sw side when i called for a appt .
i 've been to so many that only have lettuce .
they were almost double than the company i used ; the safe keeper .
worst company by far !
awful customer service !
!
very disappointed .
i 'm not joking .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
avoid at all costs .
the rice had such hard pieces in it that i almost chipped a tooth .
worst thanksgiving meal ever .
they used a turkey roll instead of real turkey .
bad idea .
this review is for the take care clinic inside this particular walgreens location .
absolutely ridiculous .
d. privacy - limited .
it is the prime reason i only go when i have to .
i pick up prescriptions once or twice a month and it never changes .
they need more staff and more efficient staff .
nobody even tries to help customers faster .
i also once had an employee give me a prescription for some other person .
do yourself a favor find another pharmacy to use !
this place stinks !
f this place .
i searched the bags and my car .
he came out telling me he is sure it was put in my bag .
get it together walgreens .
no thanks .
also the pizza is like $ _num_ too .
and was close , but not as good as the old ones .
we then called and placed an order with another nearby pizza place .
it was missing .
when we got home , we ate the pizza and meatballs .
ordered from here tonight .
i was so excited to have deep dish !
so glad rosati 's is out here in las vegas .
amateur supervisor no doubt .
are you kidding me ?
after i paid for delivery , they wanted me to drive it back .
i was in the area and was craving chicago style pizza .
the girl apologized .
we 're visiting from cali ... we were n't too impressed .
i would n't have ordered !
either take $ _num_ off or take your pizzas back !
the hubby was not happy .
this place is horrible !
i could literally make dough balls out of the uncooked dough .
sadly , no .
the staff are not happy .
not kindly very rudely .
yea i do but the menus at each location are different .
worst service not recommended .
gordon ramsey would of gone off .
i pass on this place .
that was fine but then _num_ 1/2 later was when it was finally delivered .
they failed .
the chicken wings had blue cheese dressing all over the container .
_num_ for _num_ .
crust had no flavor .
the folks next to us also commented on dry pizza .
would only go back if its late and everything else was closed .
i am like , what in the world is she doing serving tables ?
it was more of a swiss cheese , onion and bell pepper sandwich .
i would always get gravy on the liver until recently .
since i wanted more than just cheesy pasta , i added the chicken option .
barely mediocre .
that is why we gave _num_ stars .
henry 's had plenty of room , and now i understand why .
not exceptional , but more than i had expected .
real shame .
party of _num_ .
service was horrible .
no excuse for service this horrible .
waitress needs to be fired immediately .
i chose this place strictly for the yelp rating .
everything else was barely mediocre .
missing silverware and napkins .
so if u read this hopefully i will c u at village pub .
worst ever .
no thanks ... .
i will not be going back .
9:00 pm wednesday night - looking for late chow .
asian chicken salad ?
waitress still nowhere .
all five of us went in for cleanings and x-rays .
only my _num_ year old was clear .
all five of us went in for cleanings and x-rays .
only my _num_ year old was clear .
went for breakfast and ordered a vegetable omelet and turkey bacon .
try the one on warm springs instead if you want to call ahead .
they are both telling me that the kids meals are not free .
would put _num_ stars if i could .
dr. kim is awful !
this place is horrible .
this place made me want to kill myself .
you call ahead to plan an event and you only get one bartender .
lame .
this is a _num_ floor hotel with only one elevator .
get out of my way and off the elevator .
it would definitely seem that they are less focused on the former than latter .
no thanks .
night ruined .
yes , i am ruining the artisan .
ugh .
ugh .
it was scary from the moment we walked into the lobby .
it was a mess .
the pizza was disgusting !
i would never stay here again .
it took her a week to return my call despite numerous messages and emails .
there 's already a club downstairs !
my bridesmaids and friends were opening champagne and pouring drinks for our guests .
lame .
tried going here with two of my buddies for a few drinks last night .
the pool is just like the club all over again .
this place is ridiculous .
the staff is rude .
the dj sucked .
the crowd was quite eclectic .
artisan , i am officially done with you .
wrong .
the birthday girls and the rest of the group shortly followed .
shame on you artisan .
i have been to artisan after hours _num_ times .
nothing fancy , just a birthday hangout .
it is a cheap hotel so you get what you pay for .
_num_ for a mixed drink .
why would i return here ?
they finally had to tape something white to it .
not in real life , right ?
first off , i want to be clear .
ridiculous .
pros : cheap prices , not far from strip .
horrible `` hotel '' .
extremely difficult to relax after a long day with all that going on .
it 's not the little things i 'm concerned with .
nothing special .
then they kicked me out and let the girls go .
the valet was awful .
the sliders had bacon with some sort of hickory sauce and cheese .
overall the food and drinks get a but the atmosphere gets all _num_ !
at 3am this place is jumping with music and people getting there party on .
keep your expectations low .
wrong !
i stayed here for _num_ nights for my sister 's wedding .
i would not stay again .
it was insane .
other than that , though , most of the hotel staff were very friendly .
damn shame .
she did it _num_ times really loud .
terrible , terrible service !
lame excuse .
the pool is very small , but intimate .
no tubs either .
no thanks .
it 's so atrocious .
not a soul in the place .
worst hotel ever .
do not stay here .
, so why not !
it was like blood was gon na start dripping from the walls any minute .
terrible mattress and pillows !
gee , where do i begin .
the bathrooms are bad .
our room had a window looking out onto i _num_ .
no way !
prices for drinks are outrageous .
i have a feeling this place is headed for mucho trouble .
i said that when people are dancing or even standing , its a party .
- the club - pretty as everything is here , but also too loud .
hurts my ears with ear plugs .
- restaurant is only open friday and saturday .
its my last morning here before check out .
gross .
Negative
she asked for my company for the night after reading some reviews .
( the dance floor is not a dance floor .
bouncers were cool though .
also if you want food you need to leave the hotel or order delivery .
it was very cheap thank god .
overall the hotel seems like a nightclub with a hotel in it .
also small mirrors are all over the ceiling .
that really concerns me .
tried this place twice .
this use to be my favorite place .
but there obviously has been a change in management .
from almost _num_ weeks ago have yet to be acknowledged or responded to ) .
stayed at many places up and down the las vegas strip .
little suggestion for the place would be to get black out curtains .
so i 've stayed here tons before .
this was my last stay , however .
not a little spot .
for our honeymoon we used priceline and ended up at the artisan .
an old fashioned made with jack daniel 's ?
not at this classy joint .
the hotel was located in a dark and shady looking area of town .
the ceilings , yes ceilings , and walls had all sorts of strange paintings .
there was even a running water fountain right there near the reception desk .
fortunately there was an atm nearby , and the fees doubled the entry charge .
this place ... yea not feeling it !
my ceiling fan is about to fall apart .
maybe you are looking for a club and that is your thing ?
they make you put down $ _num_ security deposit .
you are warned !
musty smell throughout hotel .
rooms were clean but possibly appeared that way because of the dim lighting .
ummm ... no thanks .
the bed is terrible !
you really can not escape the volume .
it sounds like you are inside a nightclub trying to sleep .
cabs are very expensive in vegas though , more than nyc !
i have been meaning to follow up on the bed bug situation .
what a terrible experience .
we do n't mind it that this hotel is off of the strip .
overall , it 's an ok stay .
my girlfriend and i were planning on staying the night , january 4th .
however , the hotel did lose two customers for the night and moving forward .
i would not stay here again .
literally , shower would not work .
i feel like it needs a serious remodel .
the people behind the bar looked less than professional .
will not be back !
so there need to be more options here or an actual , matching set .
what a complete disappointment .
then water wo n't drain .
whatever , minor things .
so we stayed a night and checked out the next day .
excuse me ?
so i was given the managers email .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
just lotion and shampoo .
they switched my room .
which i was excited for to celebrate my boyfriends bday .
wrong .
the said they would try to have a room on saturday for us .
the servers were surprisingly friendly .
forgive and forget ?
besides this , the portions have gotten significantly smaller than before xmas .
but it would be good for groups .
there is nothing you need to rush over to cafe noodle for .
i have never had chinese food like this ever .
the service on the other hand could of been better .
just put down a dollar at least .
ugh .
almost all the dishes are at least $ _num_ .
not good .
however with time passing , so does this restaurant .
we just visited this cafe twice in a week .
horrible experience !
one waitress appears very very sneaky .
seriously , put some money into the bathrooms at least .
so disappointing .
it was a weird experience .
the veggies they put in it were green and tasted fresh .
gave it away to someone else : ( .
im disappointed .
not as great as before .
we waited for a very long time after we put the order .
nothing was served .
not healthy at all .
too much oil .
too much grease .
very misleading .
not enough noodles .
probably will come back if i 'm craving pho in the area .
nonetheless , this place is nothing more than average by far .
ahh , then i discovered saigon _num_ .
probably not .
your service sucks .
your host is absent minded .
you suck pho long .
ugh .
first , the soup come out really fast .
the broth has a distinct cinnamon flavor , which is typical .
the _num_ % gratuity is added with five or more in your party .
the service is disappointing .
the salt and pepper calamari was a suggestion from my waiter .
it was the bomb !
i felt uncomfortable .
first , saigon _num_ is much better .
we ordered , ate , then i went to go pee .
then he just leaves .
i brought a friend here to have him experience a real vietnamese meal .
big mistake .
stick to pho _num_ .
so the first few times i went here the food blew me away .
when they get us seated they just point and leave .
came here around 2am on saturday after gambling at bellagio .
the pho here sucks .
will not come again .
waiting outside on a hot summer day is not fun .
its like a chinese restaurant running out of rice .
the size of the bowl was really small .
i feel like i 've had better pho back in la .
impersonal and sometimes difficult to get the waiters ' attention .
they automatically charge a _num_ % gratuity for parties of _num_ or more .
- some people at the table ate there before .
bad service .
i 'd try another restaurant in the same plaza .
so in we go .
_num_ .
my pho was a bit salty .
but had better pho down the street from this place .
am i coming back when i 'm drunk ?
decided to check out this pho place after some drinking and gambling .
the broth could be hotter as mine was just warm .
frankly , i get suspicious when the broth is n't steaming hot .
this seems to be the only pho place vegas people go to .
shame !
just drive down the street to pho so _num_ .
never go there again .
i have been going to pho kim long for many years now .
this go around , i had the chicken pho .
Neutral
_num_ stars for being open _num_ hours and having a sweet name ... .
_num_ stars for eh food .
the pho was eh , not the best .
_num_ star for my friend having to wait forever for his fried rice .
fried rice ?
rip off .
they think they are a _num_ star restaraunt .
_num_ % tips was automatically added to the bill .
food b , service c , atmosphere b , price c .
i 'm sure i can find better pho places in vegas .
it 's nothing special .
totally disgusting .
our server also sucked .
what a fool .
terrible service !
pho kim long is my go-to for pho and bun .
he was up for _num_ seconds !
pho is terrible .
it seems they have security problems here .
this is only second time we have eaten here .
that was stupid !
service was nonexistent .
we asked for hot tea , and never got them .
i got to try the fried noodles which was decent .
i 'm never coming back .
spring rolls were nothing but noodles and the dipping sauce was sour .
do n't order the salt and pepper calamari !
the picture looked so much better than the outcome .
so disappointed .
the batter was gross .
other than their customer service being excellent , their food really needed some improvement .
the waiters are very pushy and they rush the heck out of you .
wow , things change really quickly over in chinatown .
if anyone has any suggestions please let me know .
only eat here if you want a little extra protein .
they add _num_ % gratuity on your bill !
not cool .
_num_ stars for that .
_num_ star .
the small is enough for me but it is a very small portion .
i 'm so sad !
broth was below average .
watered down , much ?
cheaper too , albeit .
my friends and i got drunk and were craving for some pho .
any pho restaurant you go to will have onion dip in vinegar .
the soup was not hot .
if you 're a big eater then you need to order _num_ bowls .
on the onion with vinegar condiment , i even ask the manager .
its neither .
it 's so apparent that there are 2-3 metro on site .
i even had an officer direct me to my table .
there are plenty of other pho restaurants i 'd prefer over this one .
went here cuz our white cab driver told us it was good .
worst service ever .
food was n't that great .
this place is terrible .
expensive and too much five spices in the broth .
would not come back !
bad customer service .
so this is my honest review of the place and probably my last too .
too many places put there .
she just gave me the money and i paid without giving a tip .
i hate the cashier there .
absolute terrible service .
why _num_ stars ?
unbelievable .
it stuck so bad !
the pho 's a bit pricey and they 're very short on selection variety .
the wait 's long and it 's super crowded .
i ordered the drunken noodles with the vegetarian option .
too much msg .
do n't go this place period !
so disappointed .
came out pretty quick , the bowl is not large enough for my standard .
he said ok and walked to the back .
frustrating .
what a let down .
typical for an asian restaurant i guess .
they 're open _num_ hours .
so frustrating !
i was just at this establishment ( at approx .
i was in a party of _num_ and we needed a split check .
flat out ridiculous .
and when i ask for fork for kids they gave me attitude again .
got sat down quickly and had our orders taken .
disappointing .
the bbq pork was off .
1st miss in a number of visits .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
pho at kim long is just average .
it is too salty and the portion is too little .
this is tricky part and do n't fall to it .
i had hue style beef stew pho .
this seems to be the only place open .
boy was i wrong !
no depth of flavor .
the first time i came , i was with a party of _num_ .
one of my buddies got a hot bowl with cold soup .
how that happens , i can only imagine .
i 've had the chicken teriyaki and it was okay .
teriyaki madness makes just as good of a chicken teriyaki as pho kim long .
and be aware , tips are included in your bill .
sometimes you walk in and it kind of smells like pee .
with that being said , my service here is never consistent .
i have had problems with getting my food on occasions .
it is n't great .
horrible customer service !
the server was none too apologetic about it either .
it seems like the staff there just wants to get you in and out .
there are alot more restaurants down on the road .
it 's my go to food any time i am feeling subpar .
the peanut sauce was also a little off .
it was n't that good .
not kidding !
i was a huge fan of kim long up until this point .
that 's why we had _num_ different ones .
horrible service !
and do n't expect anybody checking you frequently to see if your dining experience .
it 's ridiculous .
no respect , no money .
no customers .
not a good place to eat .
terrible service .
very disappointed ... .
the worst service ever !
the waiter sat us by the door with a cold weather .
they 're open 24/7 which is why they 're popular .
plus , they stopped serving tripe .
hated it .
on a sunday morning , i found this place to be quite dark .
i understand when you are in vegas and your drunk food usually tastes better .
even after eye contact .
hated it .
no , just no .
i will never go back !
... green tea !
pho kim sucks !
it tasted so artificial and americanized ?
oh and also hot tea is not free .
is it just a nevada thing or is it just this place ?
not worth the money .
this restaurant caters to tourist .
the food is just ok .
the black bean beef was the better of the two dishes .
too greasy for me .
some of the pieces of chicken had a really consistency .
it 's hard to describe .
the texture was not chicken .
service was initially very fast but we had to wait forever for our bill .
i would never go back to this dump .
i ordered the combination pho and it came out very quickly .
bland .
then he just went away .
first , the employees are douche bags .
they provide more soup and less noodles .
also , they are n't careful with how they handle their bowls .
food is nothing more than ok.
service is horrible .
i wish people would stop going there so they can learn their lesson .
be very careful with your bill !
a dollar here , a dollar there.
worst customer service ever .
then combo dinner rice , with shrimp and beef , and a chicken platter .
overall - there are plenty of other pho places that are better .
skip this one .
unbelievable .
so , as a customer i was furious .
very disappointing .
the waiters are so mean .
wrong .
it smells like wet rag .
gross .
no refund , nothing .
i always order the calamari , vermicelli noodles and side of pho .
the food was exceptional .
nothing much to rave about .
the cilantro and lime was a lot less than other pho places normally give .
just ridiculous .
long story short .
the eggrolls were greasy and very small .
.
came in sat down promptly and order right away .
wo n't come back .
thumbs down .
_num_ ) so we sat apart .
thumbs down !
not in mood to go back when in vegas next time .
worse management ever .
who would think rice , so simple and given , would cost so much .
barely any noodles .
truly disgusted .
waste of time .
pho jenny down the street for late night pho even beats this place .
so i know how much it has changed .
the service here sucks .
i had a craving for some pho after work .
not the end of the world .
and i again get a complete non reaction .
no apology , no manager .
service is horrible !
it was pretty busy , like how it usually is , so i waited .
this is not ok .
actually kind of disappointed .
service was terrible .
very rude and unacceptable .
we are here in vegas fo a _num_ days vacation with kids and friends .
that was unnecessary .
this place absolutely sucked !
i hate everything about it .
service is horrible .
and i still paid and just walked out .
i 'm pissed .
there are plenty of pho restaurants in the area .
i will not be returning .
_num_ .
_num_ .
excuse me ?
place is dirty .
it was dingy broth and all i tasted was salt .
the egg rolls are pretty typical .
it was n't worth it .
he said , `` ok '' .
nothing .
i ordered bun bo hue , it taste kinda ok , but very greasy .
every time i 've been here the food has been great .
was a nasty person .
was so rude .
our waiter also forgot my sister in laws noodles and two beverages .
but , it was inexpensive .
there 's also house made sauces and spicy pepper sauces like sriracha .
it 's also open _num_ hours and located within las vegas 's china town .
my pan fried noodles were a bit salty .
but at least it opens _num_ hours !
the services is horrible .
i used to visit this place every time i 'm in vegas .
not anymore .
not even a _num_ star .
its horrible !
make sure you check your bill before paying .
i 've had better fast food chinese then this place !
shortly after that _num_ parties including ourselves got sat .
once sat waters were placed in front of us without a word .
rude from the start .
then , these _num_ asian girls walked in .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
there are other choices in vegas for pho .
no flavor .
terrible service .
service was bad .
so just stopped by this place .
i only rated so low cuz of how the service has been lately .
it does n't .
not the worst part .
lame !
this noodle place sucks .
if not , you 'll pay for their mistakes !
it was a saturday night , and we were promptly seated .
neither did she .
i finished my pho , and she asked for a to go container .
never going back !
hella rude though .
no take out !
the pho was disgusting .
crowded even at _num_ am , i was expecting really phenomenal pho .
we had a group of _num_ .
there was dirt on our veggies in our spring rolls .
i come to san diego and try to eat pho kim long .
over priced , over rated !
nasty !
Positive
seriously ?
this pho was not even close .
the honey walnut shrimp from panda express would be a better option .
go to pho so _num_ or pho saigon _num_ .
absolutely awful experience !
either they were drunk or just never had real good pho before .
cashier gave attitude when leaving .
and charged us _num_ % gratuity .
costumer service is terrible !
the pho is terrible !
terrible service and dirty .
waited almost _num_ mins for pho .
but tonight it all changed .
my experience ranges from pho , pad thai , to their clay pots .
i ordered a number _num_ , the vermicelli with chicken .
sorely disappointed .
the prices are ridiculously priced .
the dishes here are quite expensive .
the menu was probably comparable to the expensive las vegas area .
the bowls of pho were a little on the pricier end in my opinion .
there were limited options for pho since they serve other things on the menu .
you only had 5-6 pho combinations to choose from .
absolutely hate this place .
chicken wings are a crime scene .
)
food is not as good as other places in chinatown .
all hype no substance .
just ate there after the hubby wanted pho .
it 's about _num_ degrees i vegas so i opted for a cooler dish .
i 've been to this place twice .
very sketchy thing to do .
i would not recommend this place .
the broth was flavorful and not too oily so that was also a plus .
i can get better pho for cheaper at plenty of other places .
terrible service .
but it does n't live up to the amount of hype it gets .
usually you leave that for the customer to decide .
it 's a hole in the wall like most pho places .
typical ambiance one would expect .
wo n't be back .
nothing special about it .
we normally stop by here to eat when we r in vegas .
majority of the staff can not speak english at all .
pretty much there is n't gon na be a next time .
we basically switched tables _num_ times .
the food in general , was alright .
no apology for their bad service .
# _num_ was ok .
i am never coming back .
i would rate the food maybe 3-4 stars even with it being salty .
but it drops to a _num_ because of the service and environment .
my family and friends went there on last weekend .
very rude .
worst customer service ever !
i would n't recommend it .
tend to always stop here at least once a year .
pho kim long is _num_ hours !
however , the spicy garlic chicken wings are delicious and are a must try !
will not come back .
thai tea sucked too !
never got a refill on my drink .
she did n't even bring me my bill .
seems like they cater to the non flavor people .
soup came out cold .
customer service is terrible !
boba was a little hard like it was frozen .
the beef is cut so thinly , i was expecting soft and flavorful .
it costs $ _num_ for nothing .
very rude .
recently it had been taken down .
first off , the portion sizes .
it was a slap to the face .
i had rice bbq pork , it was okay .
alright i think it 's time i move into finding another place for pho .
what worse ?
i am asian and trust me i know how pho taste like .
the pho tasted like nothing .
he was such in a rush to take our order and our menu away .
i was really disappointed !
service was slow too .
and this is the third time already that they did this .
i never had a problem with it back home .
no vegetables at all .
so it 's like paying extra for soup by ordering a large .
the food is horrible .
this is not vietnamese food .
we gave this place another chance by taking our friends there this time .
bad service .
one of the servers was seemed very short with us .
terrible service .
not worth the wait .
pho kim slow !
my boyfriend ordered pad thai and the rest of us ordered pho tai each .
pho kim long ... we go way back homes .
service was nonexistent .
the food came out on time , too .
it was drenched in salt .
all i could taste was salt .
i 'd been here before with another friend and it was much nicer .
came here very late one night after long hours at work .
service here is garbage .
they said they 'll do it some days but not others .
horrible customer service !
it was so bad .
we wanted to order more but the waiter totally brushed us off his shoulder !
they advertise _num_ rooms cleaned for $ _num_ .
go rent a rug doctor from the local supermarket for $ _num_ .
no one had arrived .
my time is worth money like anyone else 's .
this is the second time they stood me up .
they do n't !
trash .
i stopped going after almost _num_ months of not feeling better after each treatment .
the treatment i received acted as very temporary relief for my pain .
apparently _num_ men and the female owner , helen .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they seriously need to have someone that just handles pick ups .
you have to sign in and wait forever to just pick up your glasses .
anyway , they turned up her nose at my offer .
and did i do like a silly thing that makes a receptionist laugh ?
not professional .
any restaurant can have problems with any dish .
left and never coming back .
_num_ .
_num_ .
pollo loco has better beans .
the quality will make ur customers come back .
rude , dishonest and unprofessional !
do n't trust these people .
avoid !
we walked up the stairs and there were two men decorating the window .
guess where he walked into ... ... .
worst office depot ever .
he was extremely rude .
wrong .
rather , i used to .
cheap groceries .
oh yeah , and food _num_ less is across the street .
stop by and grab some chile 's rellenos !
this was my regular grocery store for _num_ 1/2 years .
i was beginning to fear what was to come .
it was bad .
expensive and nasty !
are you kidding me ?
it was bland !
meh ... nothing too special .
omg .
this place is awful .
it 's vegas turn up your ac .
it was _num_ degrees outside !
_num_ hour to bring me a bowl of noodles and soup !
everyone else on my table was done eating by the time i got mine .
stopped by at lunchtime on a sunday for pho & spring rolls .
the price was really really pricey .
waiter point to a table for me to sit .
there was no apologies .
my husband and i are not asian , was this a factor ?
answers i never got ; nonetheless , the iced coffee was delightful .
very rude !
ownership has been switched , from vietnamese to chinese .
i am disappointed .
pho kim long .
worst pho ever .
worst pho ever .
worst pho ever .
worst pho ever .
worst pho ever .
worst pho ever .
very disappointed .
i just tried their sandwiches for the 1st time .
i paid , and my bagels were handed to me almost immediately .
seems like the prices keep going up too , at all of these .
try not to come in when it 's busy .
all the employees need training at their locations .
a self serve beverage and a toasted bagel with butter .
i only visit about once every 2-3 months for staff meeting food .
the energy is low with the employees .
the manager has an apparent sour attitude .
it was very unprofessional .
girl barely speaks english .
cashier looks like she 's been up for a week .
very disappointed .
too bad ! ''
too bad for him !
taking my business elsewhere !
however , that 's where the satisfaction ended .
the sheet covering the waxing table looked used .
this place sucks .
overpriced for cheap work !
i got my eyebrows done for $ _num_ and decided to get a haircut .
i do n't normally get my hair cut for this reason .
_num_ bucks for fill is little stiff .
what a disaster .
very sloppy !
not mimi .
she was ready to polish right over it .
well another horrible experience !
for this , she paid him $ _num_ .
horrible !
do not use this company !
$ _num_ bucks for a full set , short length nails .
i left there paying _num_ + _num_ dollar tip .
i was n't pleased .
everything else was awful !
worst pool service ever .
avoid .
not a great company to do business with .
they did quickly install a new pump and heater .
i would recommend choosing another company for any of your pool needs .
they do not deserve one star .
regularly did n't show when expected .
customer service not a priority .
awful customer service !
_num_ hours ?
Negative
very disappointed .
_num_ ) .
_num_ ) .
she was that short with me .
_num_ ) .
i did not take it .
horrible customer service !
just went to eat with my honey before he went to work .
i called this morning to get information regarding a title loan on my vehicle .
gross .
the food is horrible .
one of the waitresses even made a comment that 's how they do things .
horrible service .
i was so excited to try this place .
my horchata tastes horrible .
why an horchata would taste like that is beyond me .
when the food came out the waitress forgot our silverware .
food was terrible .
you can leave the car overnight .
lattes need to be made with care .
not that hard people .
that was just my boyfriends drink , mine was super simple .
vanilla , espresso , milk then ice .
the staff is rude .
never get the order correct .
so frustrating .
this starbucks needs some management and better cleaners .
there is a laundromat just down the street , so i always walk here .
very busy location , inside and out and drive thru .
huge staff is always very busy .
service : horrible .
nobody would take my order .
i 'm holding my phone with the starbucks app out ready to order .
are you kidding me ?
no thanks .
Negative
disgusting disgusting disgusting !
service extremely slow !
they 've changed the menu and added calorie counts .
i 'm not complaining about the taste .
so since the food is getting cold i try it .
still no bread .
it was not .
not very .
by then , i was almost finished with my meal anyway .
as for the birthday dish itself , i was excited to dig into it .
i was wrong .
just random workers checking on us and apologizing .
very disappointing .
no bread .
the chicken breasts were cut in half .
very very disappointed !
you ca n't beat that with a stick .
sauce was pretty weak .
hard to believe other reviewers think this good food .
this is chain restaurant imitation italian food .
this is not the place to eat .
he came back with _num_ $ _num_ coupons good on purchase of $ _num_ .
one coupon per visit .
we spent $ _num_ and will never return .
was really looking forward to having dinner here tonight .
not like this you have n't .
oysters were good , probably the best thing i ate that night .
no kidding .
the service was horrible !
mediocre .
the mussels were okay , not the best .
too high priced for me .
crab tasted frozen an old .
you might as well go to buffet on the strip for the same price .
Positive
the service was horrible .
never again will i go there .
the appetizers we started off with were decent .
no wow factor here .
worse than red lobster .
not kidding .
boy was i wrong !
we checked in on yelp and got the free stuffed jalapeno appetizer .
medium should never be so dry .
will not go back .
ordered appetizer ( coconut shrimp and crab balls ) .
no flavor .
very disappointing !
_num_ stars is a stretch .
Negative
nothing remotely jumbo about the shrimp and of various sizes .
nothing special .
wrong .
what a disaster !
ick !
thoroughly disappointing !
it really was just ok .
no comment .
i ordered cranberry pecan crusted mahi mahi .
famous salad bowl : served with all entrees .
not enough flavor .
so gross .
which is odd since i find a lot of key lime pies too sour !
nothing too spectacular or memorable .
bacon wrapped shrimp and stuffed shrimp .
no texture at all .
the hostess was the only person that really acknowledged us .
wow was i wrong !
questionable service !
complete trash .
so disappointed !
nothing here to recommend to anyone .
it was long wait time , and i had fried seafood platter .
it was not what i ordered .
it made it hard for us to want to leave extra .
all the crab legs were picture perfect .
horrible .
they are the worst .
six weeks and still did get a solution like get to see a doctor .
i would just see him to get my meds rx every month .
he said that a doctor at hh could fill out paperwork past _num_ months .
i was wrong !
what ?
listen , i 'm on some pretty serious meds .
just dreadful .
_num_ ) broth ?
_num_ ) noodles ?
even faster then the side plate with mint , bean sprouts etc .
service : it was very fast and prompt .
prob gon na have to go back to give the pho a try .
it was like meats off a skewer you find at an american restaurant .
like most asian restaurants , what is service ?
i was charged a gratuity of _num_ % with _num_ guests or more .
service sucked .
we ordered egg rolls , pho , and a rice plate .
the only dish we actually liked were the egg rolls .
we were never payed attention too and the waiter was never friendly .
ordered the spring rolls and the bbq pork meat balls for apps .
it was like i ordered a bbq meatball salad .
!
as for the food ... ... ... ... it was average .
over priced , nothing special .
seattle pho is where it 's at .
pho is whatever .
fried rice sucks .
this was my favorite vietnamese restaurant .
i 've been a loyal pho so _num_ customer since _num_ .
not to mention the msg overload .
to build customers takes a long time .
but to loose customers , not long at all !
by the time they bring out the pho .
when it came out it was soaking in oil .
terrible service .
order _num_ pork chop rice dishes and asked for an egg on top .
the pho was practically like boiled salt water .
( almost _num_ stars ) .
this pho is n't good .
too much sodium in the soup .
i was wrong .
this place should be called pho not so _num_ !
i will not be coming back .
do not eat here .
i was in vegas for _num_ days .
this was the first thing i ate getting off the plane .
my second meal was steak at the wynn 's sw restaurant .
it was a shame .
am i missing something ?
i almost feel like the odd ball for not loving this place .
well ... not so much .
in the meantime , anyone have any other good pho restaurant suggestions ?
place was just ok .
the pho was just ok.
inconsistent .
my favorite is the triple meat beef tripe and the spring rolls .
when it comes to costumer service this hits a all time low .
the chicken dish was dry !
you could have gotten this in another vietnamese restaurant .
i had # _num_ with added beef balls .
ordered large but it seems like small portion ... just in a big bowl .
not worth the money .
so i went ahead and placed my order , the vegetable pho .
my rating for the pho is _num_ stars .
another pho place and of course shitty customer service .
i would visit this place a lot more if the customer service was better .
i think i visit this place once maybe twice a year .
ugh no !
it should n't be happening .
wo n't be back .
i joined this site , specifically to review this place .
`` pho so _num_ who ? ''
egg rolls , spring rolls that gave me fat rolls .
charbroiled pork , egg rolls with vermicelli and veggies .
gross !
it just tastes like msg .
it just show that this place does n't properly wash their vegetables .
the bathrooms are disgusting .
maybe these kids are related to the management or the owners .
terrible restaurant !
i will def not walk in there again .
it was pretty chaotic .
horrible pho .
horrible service .
the beef was old and dry .
even the price in new york was cheaper than this place !
service is no good .
very bad service .
the pho itself was not good .
will not be coming back .
but , yelp felt the need that all business deserve pity stars .
the cashier was apologetic , but not by nature .
horrible customer service !
however , the customer service was friendly tho .
service is bad !
( _num_ ) we had _num_ people .
only _num_ came out .
ugh .
this is so typical of an asian family .
when i took my first bite , i was underwhelmed by the taste .
the meat was just ok .
really bad and slow service .
wo n't be back .
it was really gross .
( i guess they use the same meat broth for all of their soups ?
overpriced and poor quality .
it was about $ _num_ and some change for an order of _num_ rolls .
they gave me a lot of chicken meat though .
guess they 're pretty clean .
lame .
disappointed .
the service is bad .
today my husband talked me into going again .
she ordered a side of chicken & a side of white rice .
i had a bite of the chicken & it tasted pretty good .
the staff obviously doesnt give a shit about you .
the idiot came back with rare meat and tripe ?
i assume they forgot to make it , but placed another order for me .
horrible service , horrible food .
however , the rice and the _num_ fried eggs fine to eat .
that makes no sense .
flavoring was plain .
this place is gross !
from the moment i walked into this place i could already feel that .
did i expect too much about this place ?
small portions for pho .
i would not eat here again .
they also forget some of my order .
the restaurant is very spacious -- as opposed to the surrounding pho restaurants .
my girlfriend felt the same way .
but while in vegas ... i 'll be going to its competitor .
would not recommend .
we went in january 1st .
i mean , really ?
so everybody in my table finished their food before i got mine .
in conclusion , i dont think i will ever come back here .
i just ca n't anymore with pho so _num_ .
very disappointing .
very disappointed .
it was my first time here so i was still looking at the menu .
just a bowl of noodles ?
no thanks !
this was before _num_ ... .
( _num_ ) we arrive here during a lunch rush at _num_ pm .
the pho was small and cold !
we thought wrong .
but there were at least _num_ of those played back to back .
someone eventually found out it was miller light .
all we got was attitude because we were making their jobs more difficult .
ridiculous !
scratch us off your list because we dont want your business .
i was disappointed !
he gave us the premium drinks for the same price so that was nice !
i had many many emails and phone calls about this .
photographer was horrible !
all in all , get your own photographer if they 'll let you .
for the life of me , i can not remember his name .
my package only included the photographer for the ceremony and some shots after .
lack of communication .
photographer kinda sucked .
the bread sucked also .
the food was terrible .
but i could have done better up there .
the girls are long past their prime and some never has a prime .
just left sams .
clearly all the reviews left are from employees ... .
some cute girls , some pushy ; standard small club stuff .
friday night , 8pm or so , that 's a shitty attitude .
went to this place last week with a friend just to check it out .
`` no .
`` hole on . ''
stale air .
stale environment .
run out at 9pm ?
wrong .
tofu hut only gives out five banchan !
this restaurant is sparse .
there are plenty of better places to go .
this was apparently more of a korean bbq place than a vegetarian haven .
not the right way to prepare tofu .
service here is horrible !
they always seem to forget that were there .
an ultimate rip-off joint !
the rice was okay but not spectacular .
gross .
totally ruined my meal .
i really do n't like the service here .
we ate it anyway though .
i 'll only come back here if i 'm having a late night craving .
because many known yelpers liked mr. tofu , we try to go there tonight .
but if i do , i want better service .
horrible .
i was pretty disappointed .
major disappointment !
the banchan were boring .
the korean pancake was way to hard .
the portions of meat was so small .
we went to tofu hut because mr. tofu is closed on sunday .
the side dishes were all suck !
one side of jun was all black and tasted nothing more than flour .
staff was not bad .
i will rather wait until mr. tofu opens on weekdays .
nothing really stood out , but the servings were plentiful .
only half of the dining area has bbq grills , so expect a wait .
there were lots of dried up food , and it was sticky all over !
they were all pretty standard as far as korean bbq places go .
no thank you .
horrible food .
horrible service .
the food was tasty at the time but now my stomach hurts .
will not be returning .
i think i ate raw pork and chicken because the grill was messed up .
drive further down spring mountain , and give korean garden bbq a try .
food was bland .
again , thumbs down .
i would recommend korean garden a block down the street .
after three hours of drinking wine and painting , we were hungry .
yeah , no thanks .
im sorry but seriously ?
waited for almost _num_ hours !
i used to really like tofu hut .
$ _num_ after 10pm .
most of the meat was tough and dry .
this place is disgusting .
they will up charge you for any left over food .
underwhelming .
pork belly is mostly thin subpar pieces that really does n't hold much flavor .
but why _num_ star ?
first time doing korean bbq so i 'm not expecting too much .
horrible customer service .
horrible .
not planning to come back here again .
and it 's the same bitches that work there all the time .
the wait was horrible .
about _num_ minutes .
never this happened before .
normally with the buffett they charged money for a kid from _num_ and up .
the ayce line was long , as per usual .
no no no .
i would n't go back .
poor quality food .
wow completely rude .
did we really just wait an hour to be treated like this ?
i too experienced this .
horrible customer service !
do they not like customers ?
do they not want to make money ?
i 've visited here a couple times after 10pm for ayce for $ _num_ .
this place gets very busy and smoky .
they wasted my time .
they closed _num_ hours earlier .
thanks but no thanks .
it is always dead .
kinda smells moldy .
nothing special there .
the wet steak burrito was probably the best thing we ordered .
not a good sign .
no refunds .
they will try to fix .
imagine your grandmother 's living room .
the place was very smokey .
i would not recommend this place .
very sloppy .
i understand that border 's is having financial problems .
try listening to the next customer 's purchase next time .
this was my second purchase there under less than ideal service circumstances .
no one was there .
i was a patron of the velvet underground for over a year .
very condescending owner .
gave lowes a lot of chances .
sound harsh ?
abysmal customer service from the install sales team .
lowes , you really really suck .
they might have had my future business on my _num_ rentals in vegas .
to bad , so sad !
my husband and i stood around for a half an hour .
this was my last trip to lowes .
lowes where the customer comes last .
will cost me _num_ .
then theres a person check receipts as you leave .
i effing hate this place !
the people !
looked disgusting .
i 'm sure you have on site maintenance staff !
disaster !
store is messy .
another thing , this is a ghetto walmart .
never expect to get in and out of this store quickly .
this location is terrible .
stopped in earlier this week .
simply put ... gross .
i only needed some liquid foundation in the beauty department .
a lot out of stock , and what was in stock was previously opened .
ugh .
the bathroom was nasty .
there was nothing nice about it .
poorly managed store .
_num_ .
i just got ta get these coupon thing down .
horrible , absolutely bad !
consistently bad experiences here .
i will list the reasons why because there are a plethora .
_num_ ) people beg in the parking lots .
_num_ ) poor service .
_num_ ) poor service .
excuse me ?
you want me to wait for this girl 's break to be over ?
_num_ ) poor service !
this walmart is crazy and when i say crazy , it 's insane .
the lines in check out are always _num_ people deep .
security guards all over and they got to check your bags before you leave .
the cold weather was killing my battery performance .
i went into this walmart around _num_ am , i was craving something sweet .
the list goes on .
i hate this place .
so lame .
so depressing !
this is absolutely ridiculous !
it smelled rotten !
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
shelves are dirty and empty .
worst walmart experience ever .
ghetto walmart ... always out of the items that i need most !
horrible !
nothing i could do .
now we 're walking around and teenage boys starts throwing around balls .
most of the cashiers do n't recognize this part of the policy .
i took my car in to get an oil change .
it was the only car in the service bay .
oil was obviously not changed .
i 'm beyond mad .
worst walmart ever .
ridiculous .
_num_ min in line for _num_ items .
i 've never been a fan of walmart .
maybe this store is okay to go to before the sun goes down .
this one is officially off my list .
but the cashier was very mad and grumpy .
very poor service .
i visited this location around 9pm on a saturday night .
it really was a long time .
bad management i think .
this place is crazy busy .
she even said calling might not help .
this place sucks .
there r more people in line then they have lines open .
this walmart needs to get there act in order .
pathetic wal-mart !
not a quality store location , but good for last minute resort .
worst on the planet !
busy place and like _num_ checkout lines !
i hate this place .
had to crawl through the cart area in order to hunt down the manager .
too much money for average quality .
the store 's appearance is dated , and not maintained very well .
this was done with only some improvement .
said she was too busy .
not 24hrs passed and three nails chipped .
i told her to stop and explained it was soak off gel .
it burned so bad .
the guy who did my mani/pedi was so rough with everything he did !
wo n't be returning .
i 'm a very loyal person and hate jumping from place to place .
it was like a slap in the face .
she sits me in a pedicure chair , with the water in it .
i will not be going back .
they are purely lazy !
will not be returning here .
no thanks .
shady and dishonest , liars !
any charge would come off of the repair .
brought my truck in to service , check engine light was on .
ca n't beat the $ _num_ price .
ultimately i had to leave .
not sure why .
with a name like that , samosa should be the signature dish , right ?
no taste at all .
just boiled potatoes !
thorough let down .
went here yesterday for lunch .
other than that i 've had better indian food .
kinda annoying .
why on earth did you give this place such a low review ?
the server , however ... .
i was not happy .
i was a little steamed .
talk about a disappointment .
it was like maybe one leg .
the sauce was bland .
disappointing .
instead of cheeseburger samosa , i got a pastry filled samosa .
we order the chicken tikka masala , shrimp vindaloo , and garlic naan .
prepared completely different from any other indian restaurant we 've ever tried .
the shrimp vindaloo was nothing spectacular either .
this had more curry sauce than the chicken tikka masala , but nothing impressive .
lastly , the garlic naan and basmati rice were just average .
the place was certainly a hole in the wall .
the folks that work there were super nice .
it was like half a potato all together .
no tart , no spices .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
some people are not suited to be in front of customers .
the server was courteous and attentive .
this was so disappointing .
it is impossible to find good chai in las vegas .
next the lamb curry arrived with a heaping scoop of jasmine rice .
if you want real indian food travel down the street to mt .
that too opening an indian restaurant and not knowing about the culture .
our waiter was overly aggressive .
unacceptable .
go here if you need some semi cheap shoes !
is n't that lovely ?
i showed her a picture and it turned out nothing like that .
it was a disaster .
much much better !
there was a very large selection of seed beads .
stopped in the other day after driving by this place so many times .
just ridiculous .
gag !
terrible .
damn things are impossible to find .
no stars .
they said it was random testing .
california , and one from st. rose hospital in las vegas .
this is ridiculous .
i will never pay that _num_ dollars .
which is not acceptable .
it 's like they neglected the clear coat , or something .
you can pay alot for their service and still get a job worth less !
_num_ there shops in cali were closed , wonder why ?
remember going the cheap way cost twice as much .
you will be sorry .
would never go here again .
my wedding day memories will forever be chaotic !
not good .
the attitude was you are bothering me , what your name ?
if you like this kind of service to customer then spend here .
not good at all .
other than we ca n't control the shipping company .
my part was returned to somebody else at a different parts company .
very frustrating !
i went in , looked around and didnt see what i needed .
i am asking you !
worst auto zone ever !
everyone there is a fucking idiot !
all i was there for was to pick up a battery .
called this location _num_ times .
there were other customers waiting for a longer time .
bad customer service .
horrible customer service .
!
a lot of the product tends to be old .
sketchy .
the store is ridiculously cramped .
learn some manners , mr. new india market .
off their food products .
do n't support this place .
the door was lock so i rang the bell .
i was gon na bring a date that was from new orleans too .
it might be expensive , maybe buy a new tent . ''
even if they didnt intend to , they sure made me feel that way .
they might be good for women , but the can not tailor a suit .
she said to pick it up _num_ days later .
i 've been to other alteration shops and i 've never had a problem .
this place is horrible .
nightmare of an owner .
note the lexus in gold parked outside the shop .
he was worse .
no prices .
( are n't retail business required to have prices ? )
he said its online for $ _num_ so that 's a deal .
it was in europe so to save me shipping i offered $ _num_ .
he was very helpful when we did ask for a certain record .
he is however pushy and overbearing .
but it 's a free market , he can charge what he wants to .
Negative
but then again i guess there 's a few of those in las vegas .
unbelievable selection but rich , the owner , is extremely difficult to deal with .
you have been warned .
my prices run from $ _num_ and up is that ok with you ?
when i asked for individual prices , he started giving me very high prices .
the last stop i made this year ends it for me .
then charge that and may even ask for more .
do the math people , that is _num_ times the market value .
it 's not worth it .
a word about other stores in lv for people looking to buy .
waste of time .
there 's better record shops in lv .
i left empty handed .
i owned record stores until _num_ when i sold my last store .
i dont reccomend this apartment .
horrible horrible horrible !
they also raised our rent without telling us !
it 's impossible to get maintenance over to fix anything !
would get up to _num_ degrees in the apartment .
horrible service and no taste .
i am kind of wonder why it rated _num_ stars in yelp .
for me i am not impressed .
bad service ?
one server that served our area and a single chef for a weekend night ?
food was not good too .
only four side dishes came , tasted so so .
i had to call the server a few times to get more salad .
come august 1st its going up to _num_ for lunch and _num_ for dinner .
we ordered short ribs , brisket , bulgogi , pork belly , and chicken .
i dont ever recall any korean bbq joint doing this .
some random info : hours are _num_ am to _num_ midnight every day .
dinner is _num_ pm to closing ( _num_ midnight ) .
if you try it and it works , let me know .
Positive
and i 'm _num_ % sure that we went to the right location .
ok , time to bring these reviews down to reality .
the pork had over _num_ pound of pure fat in it .
rice was ok .
it took me a long time to get around to writing this review .
they did not call me .
i did not get a call .
i wonder when they will get here ?
garbage .
i immediately called him back _num_ times before he answered me .
unbelievable customer service .
this is ridiculous .
i would never recommend them .
try telling a _num_ year old they cant eat .
i will not go back .
she didnt talk to me , which , i prefer .
to credit , the food was hot and obviously freshly cooked .
this location sucks .
what s shame !
Neutral
no problems he said .
worst .
unbelievable horrible service .
unbelievable .
no way , no how .
either way , pizza hut off the map for me .
horrible service .
excited to bite in to this fresh pizza !
poor service .
horrible .
they charge you for everything here , even your ranch ?
do not recommend .
it 's quite ridiculous .
not appropriate for food service .
bad customer service .
just take the delivery sign off your window !
very disappointed .
that ca n't be good for business .
subway taste much better .
food was mediocre .
do n't always trust the jimmy john 's delivery system .
_num_ times i have ordered a sandwich here .
so _num_ 1/2 stars for the food .
probably frozen and imported in from ca or hi .
oxtail was mostly fat .
the loco moco is not nearly as good as l & l 's .
on another note , the food here is very salty .
i do really like the hawaiian restaurant they have at the cal much better .
based on a recommendation , i was eager to try aloha kitchen .
the list of food sounded great and included many typical hawaiian items .
l & l a _num_ .
aloha kitchen , what 's going on ?
service was horrible !
the food just sucks .
even fast food joints in hawaii serve saimin .
so , i settled for that .
i also chose a side of macaroni salad .
ugh .
i do no recommend .
i will not be coming here ever again .
this food would definitely taste better if i was drunk .
i ca n't say any of the above was worth a repeat visit .
that 's still l & l , not mom 's .
it was that bad .
gross .
and then came the mac salad which again , l & l does better .
if that is the case , then the menu should clearly state that .
not grilled .
i mean the chicken teriyaki was very pale unlike years ago !
gross .
i 've given this place _num_ chances .
i think the spam musubi is overpriced as well as all of the food .
even l & l serves up a thicker slab .
i said for my pancakes and she says you eat butter with your pancakes ?
never going back !
i 've been a loyal aloha kitchen customer for years .
it 's cheap and really flavorful comfort food .
and it 's an asian ( filipino ) establishment .
rude .
not impressed .
sure , i can wait .
she said she 's been in customer service longer than i have lived .
worst experience ever .
i 've heard a lot of things about this place .
it was all too sweet for my liking .
it was just big cubes of frozen fish .
what a shame !
good char but too much sugar .
hell no .
the chicken teriyaki was very fatty and mostly dark meat .
it 's open late , has low prices , and has relatively fast service .
food is horrible .
that 's disgusting .
a thick chewy wrap of seaweed around a thin piece of spam and rice .
not a good spin on musubi .
... .
not real local food .
too bad .
tight bun took it too far .
rude as hell !
she wears glasses she thinks she all that !
dry and tasteless .
now the bad things .
my friend and i went there for karaoke on a friday night .
big mistake !
sauce on everything in a bento box !
$ _num_ for that ?
not even real beef .
l & l better and that is n't always that great .
_num_ min or so .
i was quite underwhelmed with the food .
i give him _num_ star for the effort .
could have been worst .
ok , so help me out .
poor choice of music .
no thanks .
i made a quote and it was exactly what i cold afford .
but my premium at the time of august was only $ _num_ .
he told me that it 's $ _num_ now , because i had moved .
worst insurance ever .
never met with anyone at any location .
very disappointed .
what a joke !
this experience does n't sound real right ?
the woman rubbed the same places on my body strangely .
dad and i ate here at about 1pm on a tuesday afternoon .
horrible service and terrible food !
left without ordering anything .
she leaves and takes forever to come back .
might come back with friends to grab a beer at the bar .
to the point of making him feel like a cheap piece of shit .
very disappointed .
ac was on , set to _num_ degrees and on high .
so much problems with this shop .
total rip off !
the manager should get fired !
it does n't end there .
they forgot to hook up the fuel line , unbelievable !
kevin was rude and unprofessional .
it is ruined .
i went out of my way because of the reviews on yelp .
rude .
bad service .
due to reviews i read on yelp , i tried this shop .
did n't see any prices posted .
asked , but not given a pickup date .
not safe for women .
once i walked in , i was very impressed with the store .
they did just that , however .
almost _num_ weeks pass , and i get a call .
garbage spot .
terrible customer service .
first of all i called to get my car diagnosed .
when i called them the following day , they quoted me all my work .
you decide whether or not i was taken advantage of .
that way , you 'll still have money left over .
the worst !
ill never take my car there again !
i drove down to their location the next morning to pick up the car .
their estimate is $ _num_ !
that is over _num_ times the price .
just recently i took my car there for repairs it needed .
this took me for a total surprise .
i felt totally insulted .
it 's not personal !
he ca n't hear me .
it is what it is people .
crap food .
i hate him too .
god freakin awful !
facility was terrible .
the worst .
amanda from desert west services were referred to me for being a trustworthy company .
the al pastor tacos taste like a slim jim .
`` i know , that is why we have yelp ! ''
another quick lunch led me to this place .
the asada was dry and had little flavor .
i will not go back .
at this location it was more beans & rice than chicken .
so i did a drive-thru order for a chicken chimichanga burrito .
brought the food to my hotel room ... ate it .
too salty .
... no .
not impressed .
very small overly chopped pieces .
everything else food is beyond fatty and greasy everything deep fried .
food is horrible .
blah blah blah in taste .
cold .
i would not recommend .
a disappointment .
food selection is very slim too .
?
if you 're vegan , ok.
with almost no meat .
i had the chicken vindaloo , and the garlic naan .
i could have made a better vindaloo on my own .
bad service high prices .
only advantage they have is very few indian places in town .
the rice had hard things in it .
tasteless !
first time tasteless indian .
very bad experience !
i 'm actually half indian , so i know a bit about indian food .
there was nothing worth eating .
i mean , really ?
after _num_ min of wait .
the samosa was very greasy .
the food was awful .
chicken curry was bad .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the food is superb .
so tacky !
customer service sucks !
poor customer service .
the correct chair was finally delivered _num_ days after it was ordered .
horrible customer service !
obviously the things i was least a fan of was the service .
it was disgusting !
was in desperate need for light asian food and quick service for lunch .
got neither .
she 's skinny with long blonde hair .
down to just _num_ star now ... .
lazy ?
major fail !
do n't bother .
wo n't be back .
unfortunately we were pretty disappointed .
the staff is very friendly but not particularly attentive .
the food is mediocre .
the reason i keep finding myself here is that damned outdoor seating .
i do n't get it .
the food is not my style .
service was incredibly slow .
the food here was on par with a low grade buffet .
hmmm , probably not .
horrible service .
never going back .
the space is small which makes it really loud inside .
this was our first breakfast here , first time here .
drinks never refilled .
my husband left half his breakfast on the plate .
it was not good .
we left $ _num_ today .
terrible service !
i like to stop in from time to time to check the inventory .
if you have n't been to big lots , you should check it out .
i have noticed however their prices are going up .
staff is friendly however they always seem stressed out and over worked .
not a great selection of anything either .
do n't bother .
boy was i wrong .
avoid this place .
ordered the surf & turf , which is the filet and lobster .
for the price , you 'd really expect that it would be prime .
for the same price i could of stayed at ny ny .
does n't sound like a huge difference but it is .
it almost knocked me out .
_num_ hamburgers & fries .
this is one that will be better coming out than going in .
palace station can fuck off !
where to begin .
only stay here if you really have to .
bottom line , not impressed .
and our expectations were low !
imagine glass being poured into a metal container every few hours .
you can feel the springs in the beds .
i guess im a sucker for a cheap deal .
big mistake !
the garden area is ghetto its like staying in a cheap motel .
i thought to myself was `` that is dirt cheap ' !
we used to stay here almost every time we went to vegas .
i 'm not signing that !
wait , it gets better .
i 'm truly blown away .
want a quality arcade experience ?
worst .
watch out for the tall blond manager .
we all should know by now that the palace station is not a palace !
-- - this is the palace station !
the room at the palace were the courtyard rooms , not the tower .
the bathroom amenities were kinda cool .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
blech , i wonder how .
booked through priceline `` name your own price '' .
would not stay there again .
i was in vegas for a convention , and stayed here for three nights .
i would not stay here again .
however , this place is just so far from everything else .
bed bug bites to be exact .
i urge all to use caution when staying at this hotel .
this is my first and last visit to this hotel and casino .
the layout of the rooms is confusing .
no tub .
the casino is sad .
i will not be back .
the gym is laughable and the shuttle schedule is the same .
wait for the next one , in an hour or longer or cab it .
gross .
i mean , you get what you paid for .
they gave me another room .
i somehow woke up with bug bites on my arm .
not pleased with the rooms .
ugh .
it was like paying for nothing .
how i 'm not pregnant is shocking .
the food here sucks .
not a fan .
pool and courtyard very dated .
provide tables for everyone and provide more food choices .
it was smelly , dark , a place i would consider spending any time .
not certain what the fee was for .
having a chat with the registration manager the fee was reduced _num_ % .
no elevator .
it was my first time here .
gross .
i had to sleep .
the casino itself is never full so there are always slots to play .
i usually get comp 'd for a tower room , which is pretty decent .
when i arrived , i found they gave my room away .
we 've stayed there once before , about _num_ years ago .
that was very much appreciated .
hotel gave away my room .
horrible service .
terrible hotel .
it is so gross .
it was completely annoying .
i probably will never step foot in this place again .
if you want to experience old vegas this would be a good starter .
_num_ out of _num_ stars .
do n't expect much when you eat here , just coffee shop food .
then shes like we 'll we do have americano .
( maybe they just do n't care !
not great customer service .
i will not be visiting again anytime soon .
we got what we paid for ... cheap as is near the strip .
waitresses would take forever to gets drinks for you when if gambling .
make sure they give you this $ _num_ deposit back at check-out .
anyways , not a good feeling .
as for wifi in the room -- kind of confusing .
if you 're a seafood fan , you have to try this place .
!
bad bad bad .
never never get the ground floor cheap motel like garden rooms .
the worst hotel ever !
cheap tables .
this place should be called old people city instead of palace station .
everyone in the casino is over _num_ .
feel like haunted motel style .
you 'll be smelling cigarette smoke for the entire time you 're there .
all the furniture and linens smell like cigarette smoke .
the room itself is very small .
i definitely walked by that room just to check it out .
pay the extra money and stay at a hotel on las vegas blvd .
i did n't like it .
paid the price .
sketchy clientele .
if you stay here get a tower room .
as far as the casino goes , its smoky and relatively low class .
room is so dusty .
the crowd thoroughly enjoyed .
the chicken was overcooked .
do not eat there .
equipment was mediocre .
gross !
what a mistake .
will never step foot in this place !
what the hell .
also , it 's almost impossible to find your room !
the place has not been updated for many years .
complete rip off .
i hate this hotel !
the room is non-smoking , yet it reeks of cigarette smoke !
if you want to enjoy get a room in the tower .
not good .
no room available .
it has between $ _num_ - $ _num_ !
over the weekend , my boyfriend had taken me here .
it was horrible .
made me feel like i was at an apartment complex .
not so much .
well , for $ _num_ a person , you get what you pay for .
especially the banana crme and coconut crme pies we tried for dessert .
it was a bit pricier being last minute but worth every damn penny .
buffet was a lot better too .
booked for a one night stop over and room was enough for the price .
their buffet was horrible .
service was nice but also sketchy .
just a bad property .
just do n't stay here .
i did n't get one .
food was bad .
poor customer service .
do n't stay here .
no elevator .
staff not helpful at all .
do not stay here .
disgusting bathrooms .
i give them _num_ star and that 's being generous .
pizza was nasty .
very small , old , small beds , noisy fan in bathroom .
would not recommend to anyone .
stairs is all they have so do n't pack heavy ... lol .
so we , an engaged couple , slept in separate beds .
cheap place to stay .
customer service was terrible .
buffett in the hotel was cheap and good though .
wife and i checked in tonight for a sunday .
just horrible service everywhere .
just awful .
hate this place .
so we got a deal from groupon to stay for $ _num_ a night .
they need to consider a small investment in upgrading these .
palace station is the first of the stations casinos chain , and it shows .
it would go hot to cold to warm and never hot again .
there 's no elevators .
everything in the courtyard rooms will need to be brought up the stairs .
as a business , you are responsible for everything that goes on .
do not stay here .
honestly , so disgusting .
do n't ever stay here for any reason .
nothing was done .
no customer service .
my bill was almost $ _num_ .
old carpet , old smoke smell , old doors , etc .
expedia is soooo apologetic .
smoke smell in the hallways .
would not recommend .
disgusting .
nothing else looked edible .
turned out , the bread pudding was the only food that was hot .
he ends his buffet with a big sampling of desserts .
my husband booked a room there through expedia located in their so called courtyard .
the place is nothing but a motel .
i called expedia to file a complaint and to change my reservation .
worst hotel ever .
this place is cheap $ _num_ + $ _num_ resort fee .
i just visited this hotel ( palace station ) this pass weekend .
i was very disappointed !
nasty !
purchased the courtyard deal on groupon .
paint was peeling off around windows .
it was n't clean .
the housekeeping staff was up early and they were loud .
there 's also overpriced room service coffee , if you can justify the expense .
it does have a pool , but its a small one .
it 's located in what feels like the edge of a residential area .
doubt i 'll be back .
this place is terrible .
we had to change rooms _num_ times because of smoke smell and mildew smell .
i can not speak on the hotel .
it 's just gross .
not big into gambling here .
tv remote dead .
Negative
they asked again to confirm his name over and over .
he finally got to sleep and showed up to work at noon .
i stayed at the palace station with my husband and friends for two days .
prices are low and quality even lower .
do n't do it !
the night housekeeping is the only staff that should get to keep his job .
do not stay here .
these rooms are disgusting .
did not want to sleep in this place .
gross !
even when you upgrade your internet , the wifi still kicks you off .
will not be staying here again .
again , this wasnt by just one employee ... it was by several .
tv , bed and bathroom .
the entire hotel smells like cigarette even in the `` smoke free floors '' .
the casino is dated .
restaurants food is terrible .
i had a room in the `` courtyard '' .
even so , we could still smell smoke .
you get what you pay for !
but the beds suck .
the front desk would change my room but at an extra cost .
horrible experience .
horrible !
horrible !
horrible !
entered the room to find two full sized beds squeezed in a tiny room .
upon laying on the bed , felt springs in my back .
i was not pleased .
then they charge me extra for resort ?
that was the same as telling me we do n't need your business .
out with my daughter , we wanted a buffet .
blah i 'd probably fairly accurate .
if hungry and broke , i 'll join the other homeless people there .
but my route changed last minute .
which they are not responsible for ; suck !
as we all know .
also , conveniently , it is open quite late .
eggs gross me out .
most everything was bland .
do n't believe the hype .
salmon skin salad was tiny and tasted only of salt .
there were many hits and misses that added up to one giant bill .
my parents were visiting from la and out of all restaurants i chose ichiza .
big mistake .
i am in shock with the service we got tonight .
i 've been here about _num_ times and never had a problem until tonight .
it was confusing and did not make sense .
poor service , again .
from the wall is not my cup of tea .
are you kidding me ?
Neutral
you could say that the price is pretty cheap .
the tuna and spinach roll was fine but the fish was nothing very memorable .
too cramped for my taste .
if i decide to go back , it will be takeout .
i also ordered some kind of diced tuna salad .
lastly was the famous honey toast .
after all , how many oversized meals can you handle in a weekend ?
this was not even close .
honey toast dessert is totally overrated .
but there 's tons of better japanese places if you go during normal hours .
ichiza should be far down on the list in my opinion .
the fish is sliced too thick and it was chewy .
the salad was drowned in peanut dressing , making it almost soup like .
he insisted it will only be a _num_ wait minute .
what i love about this place is that it opens late .
and she kept putting down the plate and picking up the plate .
so never again ichiza .
why ca n't i get a menu ?
i could never quite put my finger on it .
i suppose if you 're looking for a cheap eat , stop by .
if you 're looking for a dining experience or great tasting food , pass .
she did n't seem to care .
very rude .
i hate changing my review .
i actually have n't done it before .
for many years , this was the only decent izakaya in las vegas .
double actually , one of the only japanese restaurants run by japanese people .
i mean , gone gone .
and it was terrible .
the ramen was nasty .
my bill was $ _num_ .
however , this time around everything fell short !
i am so disappointed !
there are no reservations !
the hostess are nice ... .
oh my dear ichiza , how i will miss you .
i was completely ignored .
my food forgotten .
it is nothing i have ever had before and i would order it again .
the yellow tail sashimi was alright too .
i guess ichiza isnt for everyone .
this place is overrated .
my expectations were way too high .
service is n't professional , either .
actually , this is why i keep going here .
not for food .
not good .
not worth the wait .
the honey toast everyone was raving about is also $ _num_ .
overall , highly overrated - your foodie sf yelper .
never once were we greeted .
the first time i come to ichiza i request a table for _num_ .
im the first in my party to get there .
in that time _num_ parties of _num_ are seated .
at this point , i get the picture .
food is n't made with much attention .
will i ever go here again probably not .
my sister went upstairs and talked to her .
we paid them in cash $ _num_ with the extra $ _num_ .
no more !
this place is disgusting .
i mentioned to another management next time and got the same respond .
she did not do anything either .
he 's taking for granted especially for a long term customer .
disappointed !
no more . ''
some were decent , most were par for the course .
no problems there .
service was so-so , not the typical japanese hospitality you 'd expect .
nothing is happening .
not going back .
wo n't be back .
i do n't get it .
it was so slimy and weird !
if you go to this place , make sure to read the wall too .
tar tar roll ( _num_ stars ) : it was like a sushi tostada .
flavorful , not dry .
black cod fish ( _num_ stars ) : perfectly cooked .
stick to entrees maybe ?
would not recommend to anyone .
that is unacceptable .
the extra charge for refills on drinks was kind of unnecessary .
it used to be my favorite place .
it tasted fishy .
the menu items placed on the walls makes ordering very hard and confusing .
for a restaurant with _num_ reviews , ichiza is overrated .
the yellowtail tasted old and tough .
the food quality has dropped off noticeably as well .
service - not very professional .
but i think as a server she could have asked .
horrible experience .
this place is cheap .
the food was terrible .
dirty restaurant and bad food .
disappointed .
no more !
i decided to recently eat here again and i completely regret it .
the food is terrible .
will not be back .
the pork kimchee , beef tataki , and honey toast were delightful .
gross !
in fact , i have n't found anything that compares .
i would rate this restaurant less stars for food quality and taste .
on the other hand , i 've seen $ _num_ jobs that were flawless .
spend ur money elsewhere .
freaking karaoke host really ?
no oil !
she made it sound urgent to get this done .
i 've never met a company like this before .
the owner should hire somebody that smiles more than eric .
the test said the block was fine .
bad !
rude customer service .
dont waste your time .
people are rude .
i ended up taking the bus back to the wynn .
this was my first massage , my girls 2nd massage .
this sucks .
plus this place is freezing .
had a plain cheese pizza .
here is why it gets _num_ stars .
they need to leave it in the oven longer or something .
very poor customer service .
in short , nothing special .
closest thing to nyc pizza this valley had .
update : place has been sold and is under new management .
and not in a good way .
only place i will go for pizza in the entire valley !
terrible service !
awful beef tacos !
and horrible service .
it was loud due to the live band playing .
third , do n't assume a bottle is what i wanted .
boo for the bitter bartender .
but no thanks !
lame .
i only went for an event in the back room .
terrible place .
egg custard tart not good .
disappointing chinese bakery .
get them while they 're hot , though .
after grabbing a banh mi over at mr .
the custard bun , on the other hand , was much better .
horrible service and rude staff .
how hard is it to put blue icing on it instead of pink ?
ruined my birthday cake .
avoid this business .
here 's my experience : i 've used them for years .
but , both sets of screens were made too large to fit the windows .
the initial consultation and work sent well .
they came out , took measurements and then scheduled the install .
this front receptionist name samantha really should just stay home .
as a long time commercial customer , i have never seen anyone like her .
i asked for assistance and she spoke to me in her language .
rude rude rude .
i will not be back .
i should just walk out without gave this old man business .
such a shame .
bartender was busy talking about his fav songs from some band .
service just sucked .
disappointed this visit !
i was really excited to try this place .
that 's my rant .
disappointed .
this place shady as fuck .
the drinks are cheap .
the music was so loud .
my pizza was getting cold .
she said $ _num_ .
with this company i would suggest scheduling and being present during said inspection .
as with any rental , make sure you have proof of carpet cleaning .
not even one star !
this is laughable at best as i am very type a personality .
my refrigerator is dead .
living out of a cooler for the weekend is sooooo not fun .
pretty stupid move imo .
i 'm _num_ years old , first and foremost !
unbelievable that you would respond after almost two years to this ?
not good !
however , again , i was raised to do right .
shame on you .
pretty stupid move imo .
feel free to try again though .
Neutral
nasty .
terrible .
the tables ca n't be clean .
too much oil in their food .
waiter was somewhat rude .
all the other dishes were ordinary .
i got the roast duck and roast pork on rice .
back in boston this dish would cost $ _num_ and taste a lot better .
there was more roast pork than duck .
rip off .
are you kidding me ?
!
awards ?
truly disappointing !
and it 's not cheap for the food they serve you .
big mistake .
poor service .
bland all the way !
roast pork and duck taste ok .
just avoid this place .
what the hell happened ?
the roasted duck was awesome .
the prices are comparable to casino restaurants .
a real disappointment .
if you want a pound , they give you _num_ pounds .
i 'm sucker for asian food !
they are very cheap with their meats .
what chinese restaurant charges you for rice with sweet and sour chicken ?
they can accommodate a large party and it 's cheap !
awful awful service .
really the worst !
_num_ .
_num_ .
but they 're duck and pork is what saves this place .
not okay .
the rice has too much water .
it was a lot of money for average food .
very disappointed !
but when it came we got roast duck instead of bbq pork .
did they not understand english ?
wrong .
service is laughable !
so stupid .
disappointing .
none of the servers do .
i ordered wonton roasted duck noodle and the broth was salty .
all the soup noodles were at least _num_ and more .
oh btw , this restaurant takes cash only .
for a while they were known as the go to place for chinese bbq .
with crooked practices , you have to watch them carefully .
go upstairs to capital seafood or go down the street to cafe noodle .
it was awful .
bad !
$ _num_ + tip .
we were disappointed .
service ... poor .
how do they stay in business ?
it was so rude .
food was epic failure .
avoid at all cost .
location : typical chinese restaurant .
expensive .
to top it off , each entree ran $ _num_ - $ _num_ .
i 'm going to stick with pho in chinatown from now on .
fellow yelpers : any suggestions on other better chinese restaurants in the area ?
we walked in , and immediately saw the `` cash only '' sign .
luckily , we had enough cash to cover our charges for _num_ people .
the meal itself , was adequate .
i wanted something cheap and delicious .
i think i 'm going to try capital seafood upstairs next time .
the place is not tidy and clean .
if you think i 'm being `` chang '' ( i.e .
cheap ) , be my guest , go there and check it out yourself !
we ordered the combo ; duck pork and chicken .
i honestly could finish the whole thing alone .
worst place ever !
the service is horrible !
this place was terrible !
disgusting .
service was typical , server was little pushy in taking our order .
i would stick with the bbq items here .
the first dish that came out was the walnut shrimp .
no bueno !
fried rice and flounder fish was okay .
the honey walnut shrimp and mongolian beef was nothing i 've ever tasted before .
but these dishes were so off .
we saw another table get a big plate of duck too .
are you fucking kidding me ?
there 's _num_ size servings for duck .
they gave us the $ _num_ that was due back to us .
food : we ordered duck and pork and wonton noodle soup .
gross .
oh yeah , and this place is cash only .
service is subpar , even for our low standards .
bad choice .
not too good .
my dad , on the other hand , ordered the singapore noodles .
`` its coming out , wait . ''
the food came , but the service spoke for itself already .
no good .
that is my major complaint .
worst sam woo bbq .
this place is ridiculously overpriced .
almost a _num_ star but the taste of the food saved this place .
cons : beverage took awhile after it was taken by the waiter .
i ordered chicken wontons and chicken with mushrooms .
for a chinese restaurant , this place is overpriced .
the service is pretty much like many other chinese restaurant , as expected .
the food not so great .
oh god , what was i thinking ?
but i think this was my last time and time to move on .
the highlight cash only haha .
_num_ ) over priced !
this place sucks .
saw a new roast pig hanging already chopped 1/3 in and new ducks hanging .
their vegetables were so old -- and it was what they recommended .
_num_ per yelp rules .
- the food tastes so-so .
i mean , really ?
it was laughable .
+ food came out very fast .
we were very hungry , so this was a bonus .
Positive
- extremely rude service .
never asked us how we were doing or if we needed anything .
avoid !
this place is crap .
anyways , we were seated and were immediately asked in mandarin what we wanted .
rude much .
not impressed .
noodles were bland .
Neutral
very expensive tourist trap .
do not go to this restaurant !

they towed my car from my home .
this can not be legal .
this place is horrible !

horrible customer service .
this place is just ok .
we repeatedly asked our waters to be filled .
korean food is not cheap by any means .

korean garden bbq house only gives about _num_ .
the meat was bland .

things were forgotten .
worst ever services !
avoid if you can !
bad experience and angry feeling .
the restaurant was empty .
two of the children just turned four and clearly needed assistance eating !
no more !
servers are helpful at first then they ignore you .
go to tofu hut instead .
bad customer service .
the meat just tasted old .
honestly not a big fan of korean bbq but family wanted to eat here .
they bring out little small plates , kind of like appetizers in the beginning .
worst customer service ever .
same thing happened with the rice bowls .
the service is not the best .
i would suggest a better service .
we ate here tonight .
the service was bad .
i will not eat there anymore !
worst customer service ever !
not a family oriented place to bring your kids .

has gone down hill .
the sides are very limited .
on the bright side , staff was friendly .
i hate that .
i have been to korean garden a couple of times with my friends .
worst decision ever .
_num_ ) they automatically get gratuity because it 's their house rule .
i probably would not be back anymore .
do n't eat here .
three of us ate here .
not friendly at all .
bad service today .
i had to order my beef tofu soup three times before it finally came .
since the moment we walked in , i felt like we were being rushed .
rude !
the next option is $ _num_ and $ _num_ .
so i guess they prefer making many multiple trips to give us salad refills .
the bulgogi and angus rib finger were very similar .
everything else was ok .
since i was in vegas on business , i was craving ayce bbq .
do they not like customers ?
do they not want to make money ?
we ate here back in _num_ and i just recently joined yelp .
so i just want to share my experience when i ate here before .
trying to get your assigned patient coordinator on the phone is impossible .
big , big mistake .
gross , nasty , disgusting .
if you do go there do n't sit down and do n't touch anything .
it is nasty .
avoid at all costs .
but it was a saturday night in vegas !
horrible and smelled really bad .
drinks were weak .
this place is pretty sketchy .
i asked the taxi driver to take me to a good strip club .
funny thing is the taxi driver first took me to a massage parlor .
do n't go to this club !
this place sucks balls .
this place pays cab driver 's cash to drop you off .
if you wan na pay debit it 's $ _num_ minimum !
expensive cover charge .
rude , rude , rude ... .
prices here never seem to be what 's advertised .
the girls are never as hot as i expect .
waste of money .
you are required to buy two minimum overpriced drinks .
the stars seem low but at the same time had a blast .
but lets not jump the gun .
as soon as we walked in you couldnt see a damn thing .
for one , looks are just a plus .
are you kidding me ?
there are so many other good options in vegas , lesson learned .
i was referred to this guy by another dentist .
he has over _num_ years experience .
not a real magazine .
ate here the other weekend with family .
it was not even salted .
the steaks were good but certainly not the best i ever had .
so , skip it .
wtf then why bother us .
terribly uneven .
needless to say , it took her a while to get my food ordered .
_num_ ) drinks -- they have video poker at the bar .
_num_ ) food -- bread ?
why so long you ask ?
outback has better steak then this place .
mind you we are drinking , eating , and playing at this place .
i was very disappointed !
avoid this place .
the waiter had a pretentious attitude , .
for all those reasons , it just made sense to try it .
after those two huge pluses , the main drawback was the servers .
want a refill on your soda ?
i was convinced i was going to suffer the same fate .
you can do a lot better for your money though .
old school steakhouse off the strip near downtown .
we started w crab cakes , lobster bisque , and salads .
wine list was just ok .
as expected , the chaos begins when it comes check time .
guess who is n't taking any clients here anymore ?
i 'll sum up with _num_ notes .
)
_num_ .
_num_ .
not too happy with this place .
someone from the back just came and dropped it off at the table .
he said only at tables that order _num_ or more salads .
i was sooo wrong .
service was terrible .
do n't restaurants make a mint on alcohol sales ?
there are many other steak houses in vegas that do it much better .
bad !
very bad .
the prime aged _num_ oz .
some of the same group were there for this sunday april 8th _num_ dinner .
some people 's meals were much more expensive than others .
which is bs , as i 'd had it done before .
i 'm only glad i didnt pay for anything .
would not go back .
the build up was incredible , the food was a little meh .
the decor is very old school vegas .
the desert was okay but also had a frozen taste .
dine here at your own risk !
for starters , we sat at the marilyn monroe table .
she did n't like it .
however , this time , we decided to also try the golden steer .
i did n't want another drink .
this has been our favorite steak house in las vegas for years .
completely uninspired .
but not the golden steer .
not as good as usual , but good .
when we finished , the place was a ghost town .
employees are uninspired .
they are not busy on a saturday night .
they are not taking care of the customers like they used to .
no greeting .
just _num_ ?
walks back and practically drops it in my husbands lap .
another _num_ mins later !
how convenient there was a groupon as well !
did n't take a drink order .
terrible service .
spent our anniversary weekend in vegas with another couple .
i had the filet which was nicely cooked and the twice cooked potato .
for instance my husband ordered asparagus with hollandaise sauce $ _num_ .
he responded very quickly like he was expecting it .
met friends from out of state that we wanted to please .
had eaten here before and were delighted .
can not say the same about tonight .
will not be back .
the ambiance was nice -- very old school vegas -- an older clientele .
i am a las vegas local .
rude bartender .
rude waiter .
worst creamed spinach ever .
the baked potato was a baked potato .
then the steak came out overdone ( we asked for medium rare ) .
nobody i know will ever dine here .
the service was n't very good .
none were particularly friendly .
i 'm so disappointed .
there were _num_ of us .
nothing to write home about .
again , nothing special here .
i 've been wanting to try this place for the past _num_ years !
finally we made reservations ( not really needed ) on a saturday night .
the dessert cheesecake was very plain .
i had chicken of the angels , and it was very salty .
it is not .
i had a filet , a salad , and a glass of wine .
i rather visit the steakhouses mentioned above anytime .
i was very embarrassed .
way more expensive than any other steakhouse i 've been to before .
service was very poor .
he 's too polite to say anything so he ate it anyways .
_num_ pieces for $ _num_ !
this place is horrible .
the restaurant smell like it 's burning plastic !
lost my appetite afterward .
also it was terrible .
the entree 's were brought by someone other than the server .
simply awful .
shrimp cocktail : shrimp was decent and the cocktail sauce was just okay .
as vegas locals , we 've been here several times .
would not come back here .
au jus had never made a steak more well done in my experience .
this is very disappointing .
joe you might be the reason if i return to the place .
had to try this place since its been rated so highly for years .
the atmosphere did n't disappoint .
sure is n't what it used to be .
way overpriced mediocre food .
service was horrible !
food was crappy .
so unfortunate .
but ok , why not .
we will not be back .
no coffee ready ?
lame .
one cashier , _num_ people in line .
_num_ and a half weeks to fix my dryer and _num_ visits .
with one week until the final inspection i was livid .
this is the most sketchy looking place i 've seen in a long time .
two weeks goes by and nothing .
terrible service and unprofessional technicians .
talked to this company .
the technician did n't show up .
very disappointed .
no stars !
then , my downstairs restroom , had a tornado blow through it obviously .
do not use this company .
shame on this company .
please do not use this company .
yeah , no thanks .
i support cuz its not a chain .
but this place was more like an omelet mansion the size of the place .
hubby ordered chicken fried steak and banana bread .
_num_ ) the food can not really be called that .
all in all it is just an ok place to go .
the `` homestyle potatoes '' they serve were just home made potato chips .
ginormous portion sizes that can be shared ( for a fee ) .
ingredients also included turkey , guacamole and jack cheese .
on the side was some freshly fried potato chips and moist banana bread .
it really feels like an old-fashioned diner from a long time ago .
if you do come here , be sure to watch your food .
first let down was coffee .
my friend had the stuffed french toast which was okay .
other two had omelet and eggs benedict which were greasy .
i now want to cook more cornbread , just thinking of it .
she replied she would send someone over .
the food came out surprisingly quick , and he split our checks .
every thing people say about the service is true .
just like my first visit with another old lady .
horrible service here .
boy what a disappointment .
and though i new the potatoes were home chips .
never refilled our drinks .
terrible service .
overall horrible experience .
nasty , canned food .
the toast was dry .
i just was n't impressed .
go down the street to the egg and i .
poor management .
manager is very loud when ordering tables clean .
not everyone likes potato chips with their eggs or for breakfast for that matter .
my wife ordered sausage and eggs .
she felt the sausage was from the freezer aisle from the same supermarket .
no banana bread .
we ordered banana nut & pumpkin bread which were both great .
worst service ever !
i could n't even believe it .
appetizer : we ordered fried zucchini with cheese dipping sauce and ranch .
i had a veggie omelet and my mom had a denver omelet .
nothing to write home about .
are you freaking kidding me ?
our drinks were never refilled .
the server was rude .
food was mediocre .
avoid this place .
_num_ .
so , first off ?
i was wrong .
this place is entirely too crowded and loud to expect actually enjoying a meal .
horrible customer service .
stay away from western commercial !
my walk-in went up to _num_ degrees .
just need to be more reasonable with those beer prices .
would n't go back .
it is a funky little hole with ok pizza at insane prices .
the calzones were pretty good though .
falafel balls are $ _num_ a piece !
a milkshake is $ _num_ !
and it 's cold milk with a ton of sugar on the bottom .
the location is so totally out of the way .
if you want good kosher pizza , go to nina 's cafe on flamingo .
hole in the wall in a crusty neighborhood next to a strip mall .
someone should turn the ventilation system on .
i asked for a shuttle and scheduled it for 1:30 .
the operator said the driver came to the hotel already and picked up passengers .
their website is not user friendly at all .
would n't you be ?
now it 's _num_ months after i was married .
taxis are n't that expensive .
i scheduled a round trip service to the airport for my client .
i was waiting downstairs and another girl was also waiting for the shuttle .
_num_ stars for the airport to hotel transfer .
_num_ stars for the hotel to airport transfer .
every time i 'm in vegas i am always taking this shuttle !
so , naturally one would go to them first after a long flight .
they are always late in picking up their guests to the airport .
i would recommend only the airport to hotel transfer .
shuttle could 've been cleaner too .
some of the drivers work harder than others .
2pm pick up -- 5pm drop off .
i checked a few days ago and they 'd billed me twice .
it says _num_ hours .
no tip for them !
they ripped me off !
i later found that they charge my credit card even though we paid cash .
do not use bell trans !
cheap ( $ _num_ ) , but takes forever !
ended up taking a cab to the airport ... much more available and dependable .
!
bad customer service .
bad experience this time .
not bell trans .
my stop was then last on the route .
seriously doubt that i will ever use bell trans again after this .
Negative
said one should be there in 5-7 min .
_num_ min go by .
not cool .
another thing about las vegas : it 's hot .
terrible service .
we called at _num_ p.m. for a 7:30 pickup .
know your route and it 'll be worth the $ _num_ cab ride .
bell trans almost made us miss our flight !
customer service was awful !
i could have walked backwards and got to my hotel faster .
Negative
do n't use this place .
note : i 've taken the shuttle service in seattle .
never ever take this shuttle .
especially bus # _num_ !
just pay extra $ _num_ and get a cab !
horrible !
staff was totally unprofessional .
huge mistake !
Negative
i called to schedule a reservation for pick-up from my hotel to the airport .
horrible company .
epic fail .
they deserve zero stars .
we were the only ones staying @ california , everyone else was in town .
thank goodness there were at least _num_ of us left including a baby .
the others in the bus were staying in downtown lv .
so , for that , that 's like a _num_ stars for them .
extremely rude employees !
worst service ever .
almost missed my flight .
worst worst worst experience with them .
paid for a round trip pick up with our travel package .
this is vegas baby !
booked a shuttle bus for our wedding .

`` not confident with their hotel pick up service . ''
do not use this shuttle service !
late , late , late .
and we wait ... and wait ... and wait .
never again bell ... never again .
Negative
do n't use this service .
very hard to find after getting off the plane .
the company sent me an e mail asking for a date of my complaint .
avoid bell trans .
then they went to strip first ... an hour to get to harrah .
thanks for nothing .
terrible .
terrible .
absolutely ridiculous .
bell trans ' waiting time was very lengthy from the airport to the hotel .
they crammed in _num_ people inside .
worst shuttle service ever !
which means people have to crawl over each other to squeeze into the seats .
he also went to an extra hotel to just drive around the parking lot .
so , so bad .
ridiculous .
terrible !
never again bell trans .
there goes the tip for the driver .
terrible service .
terrible .
i 'm not using them to get back to the airport .
just awful .
no no no !
spend the extra money and get a cab .
takes way too long !
lame !
the driver was very nice and courteous but that 's where the positives end .
edit : hi nicole - i responded with details .
it 's $ _num_ one way per person from the airport to your hotel .
you can suck at math but still figure out that it 's not equivalent !
in addition is was a hassle to get someone to respond right away .
worst ever .
seemed unorganized .
need to upgrade to electronic communication between shuttle booth and shuttle pick up site .
nobody knew who came first or which hotel anybody was going to .
i would recommend bell trans only from the airport to your hotel .
recently had my wedding where i used bell trans service for my wedding day .
do not recommend !
i am sitting on the shuttle as i 'm writing this review !
terrible .
selected through alaska airlines as an option .
never again bell transportation .
do n't use this service !
rude .
sending me into the wall in front of me .
unbelievable .
so we wait another _num_ min .
they wouldnt even have showed if i didnt call .
horrible customer service !
this is my second experience with bell trans and it will be my last .

the taxi was only a couple dollars more .
worst service ever !
i stayed at the bellagio in dec _num_ .
wth ?
i sat and waited from 5:30 until 6:00 then called to check shuttle status .
worst shuttle service ever !
$ _num_ each , it took almost an hour to get to our hotel .
nothing else to say so stop telling me the review is short .
a cab is a better option if you have a set up schedule .
the worst .
they did not care at all .
do not trust trust this company .
not a reliable company .
do not use this business .
horrible service and explanation .
slow and rude .
the ride was fine , the driver was friendly , van clean , etc .
no shuttle .
2:00 pick up time , didnt arrive till _num_ .
barely made my flight .
_num_ older gentleman both times .
take bell trans only one way .
made my _num_ year old mother cry .
the hole time our phones were off .
she did n't care .
not this time .
then he seemed put out to have to put the bags in the trunk .
do n't go on vacation .
do not use this service !
very poorly ran .
always late & slow .
looks like we 'll miss our flight .
to start it was extremely difficult to find .
going to vegas , did i ever worry about transportation .
departure , we had a flight at _num_ am .
we scheduled a shuttle at _num_ am , the day before .
do not use for airport shuttle .
this is ridiculous .
this was my first time and last time using bell trans !
do n't buy two way ticket .
i did n't mind this .
hell no !
finally lose my patience and just broad another shuttle in front of me .
i am beyond disgusted .
do not use this service .
$ _num_ for the round trip .
they sent a shuttle instead even though i paid for a private car .
nothing too complicated , so i thought .
i would like to give a _num_ star review if possible .
i scheduled a _num_ pm pick up from the hotel to the airport .
avoid this company .
drivers rude and late !
luckily , i caught a taxi .
i 'd miss my flight if i believed them .
worst service ever .
our flight landed in vegas at like 1am and bell trans kiosk was closed .
he said where 's ur ticket i need a ticket not a confirmation # .
i would pick a different service in las vegas in the future .
the trip to the wynn was handled professionally by the driver .
no problems .
btw : the wynn has an uber stop right out front !
not customer oriented .
horrible decision .
it took us nearly two hours to get to our hotel .
very poor customer service .
not helpful .
lame organization .
pickup at airport was smooth .
first , she picked up at the casino entrance instead of the hotel lobby .
next stop was the mirage .
which was extremely embarrassing .
no show .
the worst worst worst .
avoid at all costs .
do not patronize this company .
such crap .
the worst !
he deserves _num_ stars , the company _num_ .
not us we started at the opposite end , the tour finally got started .
this was the worst .
booked round trip transfer from airport to mgm grand .
zero stars .
zero stars .
pay the extra $ _num_ and use the competition .
worst ever shuttle service !
very poor service .
poor service .
very poor service .

confusing estimate , which turned out to be higher at the last minute .
i ca n't imagine how flowers would look during a summer wedding .
they open at 9:00 and i should hear from her by _num_ or so .
buyer beware !
i strongly suggest you research all your other options before using this company .
i contacted this company in regards to a iron entry way .
the invoice # is _num_ .
has it been turning this way for awhile ?
i will not recommend your company .
goodbye robert , you blew it .
no customer satisfaction .
big mistake .
there was hair that was longer than others around it on top .
extremely sloppy .
went here awhile ago to get a cut with a barber i was recommended .
i guess all the reviews are from people who made appointments .
looks nothing like a fade and cut way to dang high .
totally disappointed .
walked in everyone just stared .
i called to have it picked up , we were over the service .
this company needs to run like a business .
you know what , i 'm out of your fucking service .
take your damn equipment and get the fuck out of my house !
horrible experience .
no thanks .
overpriced and unfair money hungry individuals .
i find it pathetic !
worst company ever .
they drop off more water than you needed or wanted .
horrible customer service !
it 's much cheaper to just buy _num_ packs of water .
difficult would be how i describe the experience .
i thought businesses needed just a little customer service o be successful .
the owner does n't either .
they apparently do n't need any new business !
immediately , the guys said they had a problem .
he never called me back .
Negative
* the window is a standard size .
much cheaper than any art stores like michael 's .
terrible !
horrible , just horrible !
it 's a shame .
then they forgot to put mushrooms on the sandwhich that i payed extra for .
it sucks .
my dad had the turkey cranberry and there were bones in it .
walked over from the nearby hotel to grab something quick .
turkey with cranberry .
nothing else looked or sounded appealing either .
_num_ times .
meh .
but not much flavor .
my wife got the cole turkey .
or maybe the turkey .
customer service terrible .
they were nearly out of all the various bread choices .
the folks working there really didnt know what the were doing .
i would n't go back .
i didnt try the bobby .
nothing special or interesting .
the selection of sandwiches is not big .
there was just a little turkey and lots of mayonnaise .
it was not what i expected .
very disappointed .
first off i 'd like to say that i love capriotti 's .
this is a major problem !
_num_ % or more people want wheat bread over white .
umm ... no thanks .
the first time i went , i had two tires replaced and an alignment .
it was done , but something was off big time !
i 'm pissed .
very disappointed .
like holy shit , is it that hard ?
oh well .
there 's other _num_ hour tire shops near by .
this repair shop is not open 24/7 as it states on yelp .
it 's been over a _num_ months nothing come out right .
the work consisted of them installing a body kit and a complete paint job .
for the week they only took off my front bumper .
they even had to put it back together to fit the kit !
horrible shop !
you have been warned .
i am currently going to court over a contract issue with this company .
not worth the trouble !
great products but rude .
_num_ stars because the pee stained shirt we bought was only $ _num_ .
dismal .
not a good sign .
she lasted _num_ days .
is this a real office or her home ?
appliances are being repaired onsite .
i did n't like it .
worst .
i 've been a loyal macy 's customer for years .
not gon na happen .
huge disappointment .
i will say though that our driver roman , i believe , was awesome .
for real , this is vegas .
they get two starts because the substitute driver we had was so nice .
ew !
they said they 'd get the roses and champagne to us by _num_ .
not cool .
nasty .
the worst !
the last two times i was waiting for my driver .
ridiculous .
-- clearly , someone stole my credit card number .
limo of the stop we wanted to make at lee 's .
very confused .
_num_ stars for the friendly drivers and the bottle of champagne in each limo .
bad service !
we walked all over looking for her .
picked presidential because of the high yelp rating .
not great customer service .
do not ever use presidential limo !
do not book this company .
horrible costumer service !
worst experience ever !
Negative
i sent another email .
very unfortunate customer experience .
we wanted to repeat the experience and booked with presidential again this year .
during booking , i explain would like to repeat the experience .
it 's _num_ vegas .
first night : we were picked up on time and driver was friendly .
no other refund offered .
update : presidential reached out to me after this review .
no response after that .
they have not contacted me back after .
so here i am again , updating my review .
my original five star review has now been knocked down .
inconsistent .
the pick-up was assigned for _num_ after the hour .
this was not my experience .
there were _num_ of us .
oh , wait there is a problem .
their customer service is none existent .
$ _num_ for nothing .
any other company will be better than presidential .
horrible service !
we did in fact call the company , _num_ times !
it was a nightmare .
you 're so much better than that !
_num_ passengers , pick up at signature , to the hotel .
traveling by private jet , we had delayed our arrival time twice .
no help from presidential .
i was very disappointed .
this company apparently allows total jerks to drive for them .
you lost this customer .
are you kidding me ?
every thumb down for this place .
*** kept encouraging me to leave so they could go smoke .
well ... clearly that 's why i wanted them fixed before they broke .
horrible service !
when we came back to pick them up the pads were nowhere in site .
it is a huge problem in modern times .
they also managed to scratch the black part of my frame .
long wait time to just make a deposit .
slow service .
its cluttered and hard to walk through .
bought _num_ fish from kevin last week .
all died the second day .
wrong .
bought _num_ similar fish at another store the next day .
never again will i buy from them .
she would do a big favor to las vegas people .
all they need is fucking receipt and i need to find it .
so drove back .
rude employees .
i had never experienced anything like it .
do not go into this place .
wrong .
`` , `` does it hurt '' , etc .
just be careful if you decide to visit this clinic .
not tan .
and no straight nose .
but all of them seem crooked to me now .
i 've gone there for dog grooming and dog food .
on the grooming side it 's hit or miss .
what a shame !
the worst staff ever !
the owner is crazy .
avoid it .
the other wait staff were pretty friendly .
no star !
we were certainly not treated with any respect .
this place is sucks !
do n't recommend at all .
have you ever check your bill before you pay ?
still ca n't figure out why $ _num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the worker are terrified of him .
completely empty .
they do n't even deserve one star !
shame on you !
the soup at the beginning is piece of corn in corn syrup essentially .
waited almost an hour to sit down and waited .
makes me wonder about these other _num_ star reviews .
the place was rather full but nothing crazy .
they lost that chance .
as usual , i arrived around 3pm still making it for lunch .
for the same price '' and given it _num_ stars .
at this china star it 's not much .
but i just feel it 's all on lower standards .
things tasted rubbery and lackluster .
wow , and i 'm not usually very picky when it comes to eating !
there was a roach running around in there .
this place sucks .
and as soon as i saw bugs i quit eating here .
if your going to eat here i 'd stick with this to be safe .
my husband always had to use the bathroom a ton after he ate here .
$ _num_ for lunch for one .
out here for a business trip , found this place around during lunch .
huge mistake !
not to mention she made me pay full price !
however , i was expecting to eat as much as i wanted .
terrible place .
ok so it 's a cheap buffet .
$ _num_ plus drink lunch special buffet .
the food is your typical american style chinese buffet spread .
would i come here again probably not .
i think buffet asia is way better .
the staff was polite , i think .
except for the order i put the hot asian sauce on .
just a tad too much .
these two same people were seen serving guests , taking orders and such .
never were they seen leaving the dining room area to wash their hands .
descent buffet but really cheap price .
no salsa for me !
the food was terrible .
nasty !
the wait is also very long too long if you ask me .
this location is hit or miss if you get good chicken .
got money back and not happy !
will not be going back .
but eating in the dining area it was still an overwhelming smell .
is n't chicken the speciality here ?
horrible customer service !
customer service is terrible .
the worst customer service .
they never have their hot and ready pizza 's readily available .
rude employees !
i was a walk in and was greeted within me sitting down to wait .
they hardly speak english .
pissed .
i am pissed .
horrible !
okay , gel polish .
fail .
not a good massage .
i could 've painted them better .
Neutral
very insulting .
they are rude and unprofessional .
the first thing i noticed was that it was very clean .
i ordered the chicken taco and enchilada with rice and beans .
this was my second visit to the establishment .
what a disappointment .
even the pepsi taste weird .
the next morning i wanted to die .
like many other mediterranean markets it has your assorted goods and supplies .
changing appointments with only hours notice , then not accommodating for the inconvenience .
poor lighting .
you sit on top of each other in the overcrowded waiting room .
makes me nervous to go to the back for my procedure !
i 've stopped going to her .
i ca n't begin to tell you everything .
location off of sunset and according to the website same business different location .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they said they would get me a new one .
thankfully i have never been able to spend a dime with either location .
my whole house vacuum was clogged .
awful customer service !
horrible place .
obnoxious as hell .
they been stealing alot of money these months and not saying a word !
horrible !
_num_ dollars total .
avoid this place .
very disappointed .
Negative
not so much for the food but the service .
peas and carrots .
korean and hawaiian do n't in this case .
the katsu sauce was more like a ketchup sauce or a shrimp cocktail sauce .
the pork katsu was over cooked and dry .
the kalbi and bbq chicken were good .
i have not heard the single word from them .
from the outside , the place looks sketchy .
oh well - i ate it anyways .
the service was spotty .
ray l. reviewed the same experience as i did .
service was bad .
he made some boiled peanuts for my in-laws to take to the airport .
those cooks in the back really need to wash their vegetables better .
was expecting more fusion dishes , ended up being just another korean restaurant .
huge portion but nothing special .
chicken was too sweet .
june meat is boring .
she apologized and brushed me off .
which was $ _num_ .
even l & l gives half a plate of katsu and same price .
i came here wanting some kalua pig .
not authentic hawaiian .
this is an asian restaurant serving hawaiian dishes .
horrible service !
wrong .
wow insult your customer .
plus his attitude sucks .
the guys there were helpful initially .
they will not fix it .
bad service .
the guy that runs the store is a ass hole .
did i forget the water down their gas .
totally ignorant .
the location sucks so bad .
there are two problems with that .
you have my credit card , just turn on the damn pump !
the bill was $ _num_ .
so not too excited that i had to take it there twice .
but here 's what really roasted my muffins .
as another reviewer mentioned the cracked seats are in need of repair .
ugh .
i ordered the chimichanga with chili colorado .
cheap price , cheap workmanship .
way too many questions and opinions .
it was not even _num_ hours .
never , never , never again !
the fill though ... yikes .
horrible service .
went for a polish change on toes and nails , too _num_ hours !
avoid this place !
avoid this place !
scheduling was a nightmare .
how annoying !
disappointed .
total crap !
totally useless .
it 's horrible !
there was no batter .
my friend ordered a hot jasmine milk tea which turned out pretty good though .
we went here last night to get a late night snack .
i did n't care for them .
just not my thing .
a bit too thick for my personal preference .
i ended up not drinking the rest of my drink .
opt for another boba place when you 're in vegas .
the drink was okay ... probably my first and last time here .
its just bad .
not friendly .
this is my usually favor whenever i go to a boba place .
no flavor whatsoever .
its merely disgusting .
however , good service alone is n't enough for me to return .
- bland flavor .
taste like quickly .
- boba is not fresh .
neither were great !
there are many choices out there - go try em !
i got the mango slush and my bf got the jasmine green tea .
tried their $ _num_ spicy ( popcorn ) chicken .
it was gross .
the prices are a little bit more expensive than other places .
also , there is a credit card fee so bring cash .
i always get my drinks either thai tea or honey dew flavored .
a boba place in the center of china town does n't accept card ?
so i went to this place to get a shake .
sorry but that 's disgusting .
decent boba , but the tea could be better .
i 'm glad i tried it .
this review is only for the milk tea with grass jelly .
not worth it .
got the watermelon slush with boba for $ _num_ .
horrible drinks .
walking in this place , i was greeted by three friendly servers .
i was impressed , but at the same time , it was questionable .
tables were dirty .
boba was overcooked .
what a disappointment .
i recently visited volcano tea with a couple of coworkers .
would not recommend .
plus , it 's busy so you see young people in and out .
my butt .
i am so confused .
not coming back here again .
they were friendly n helpful at the standard points .
she gave me the total as soon as i told her my first drink !
_num_ drinks order !
worst service ever .
he was convinced to just try it out .
totally , disappointed .
not to happy .
felt like water with boba ... not the greatest at all .
$ _num_ minimum for all cards .
not friendly .
a boba milk tea and milk tea without boba have the same price .
i guess if you are vegan this stuff might be totally awesome .
the doughnuts were dry .
weird , i know .
also , they only take cash and close at _num_ p.m .
i went here this morning looking for vegan donuts after reading several reviews .
weak donuts !
first of all , the place is cash only .
they probably have a better selection in the mornings .
walked in .
picked out my donut .
a friendly hello couldnt hurt .
Negative
terrible office staff service .
not my idea of an ideal doctor by any means .
stay away from this drs .
.
rip-off central .
i was wrong .
to change battery , you have to use new materials .
Neutral
this place is a money grabbing lying stealing business .
i made him go get the old man and bring him out to me .
do n't go to m & i .
waste of $ _num_ .
few weeks later same problem .
poor service !
i trusted m & i for years with watch repairs .
quoted $ _num_ .
then i am told it is $ _num_ !
the older man that owns the place really talks down to people .
the watch is trash .
these people are ridiculous .
these apartments are conveniently located - near the strip and downtown .
the rent itself is reasonable .
do n't let them fool you .
sahara palms is a homeless shelter .
is n't that fraud ?
unbelievable place !
but be careful to be a day late on your rent !
this place is too hood for the amount they want .
stick with carpet you pay about _num_ $ less in rent .
would not recommend this place !
portion sizes were large and we had lots of leftovers .
i only went to this restaurant because island style was closed for remodeling .
im glad i did because now i know never to frequent this restaurant again .
there was a server doing some kind of computer job .
food was horrible .
we had pan fried noodle with shrimp and roasted pork and tofu .
there were giant pieces of fat in roasted pork and tofu .
it was too salty .
also water tasted bad .
horrible .
it was absolutely horrible .
the service was ridiculous .
it was disgusting honestly .
menu was a little different .
food was mediocre .
there 's nothing like real chinese food .
minute chicken cake noodle and shrimp with snow peas .
the other day i noticed a screw in my tire .
number three , i know what a bald tire looks like .
gets back in the car and drives straight through the garage back to me .
no marks !
this is why i do n't own a gun .
Negative
so , i had to wait again .
my family had a _num_ days new year vacation at las vegas .
was the pizza good ?
my boyfriend and i went back up to our room .
`` we do , but the pepperoni and cheese slices are already made . ''
`` your total is $ _num_ . ''
neither did the driver .
they do tell you it takes awhile before ordering though .
the driver offered no apologies .
rude !
tonight was a lasagna night .
however quite satisfied with tiramisu .
( _num_ s. valley view , lv ) .
i ordered a chicken parmesan breast and side caesar salad .
it took an hour to deliver and i got chicken fingers and fries .
not if i can help it .
never before has that ever been a problem .
and it was cold .
i was very disappointed .
ranch , hot sauce and bbq sauce .
the chicken tenders came lately around _num_ am .
i 'm surprised this place is approved by the health code in las vegas .
how absurd is that !
it was so bizarre .
there was more bread than anything .
i ordered from here recently .
and also i 've had their food ... .
this place is horrible .
you 're better off going somewhere else .
i guess , paid extra for chicken , and got tiny chicken bits .
garlic fries are just their regular fries with minced garlic .
almost _num_ hours wait time and they want more wow !
i had to come to the front of hard rock to get my food .
this place was horrible .
pizza was cold .
horrible place .
honestly , i wish they had _num_ stars to give .
delivery driver grabbed the money and made a b line for the door .
worst customer service ever .
$ _num_ - cash only .
horrible !
nasty !
rude to tenants and inconsistent .
beware - if you have ever lived here you better check your credit report .
never going back .
this place is horrible .
i could go on and on i am looking forward to moving out soon .
sounds awesome does n't it ?
this place is ghetto - smoke free my ass !
as soon as my fridge was finally replaced , my oven broke .
the neighborhood is awful .
said `` they did n't have key . ''
hopefully the owners will realize this guy will soon be their downfall .
visiting las vegas and staying on the strip , as most tourists do .
worst .
i thought that was strange considering this should be a simple question .
ugh .
you will not regret it .
the sushi however , blows !
they have a late night menu with discounted prices after 10pm .
are you kidding me ?
the food : forgettable .
i also ordered the udon off the late-night menu .
when you enter , you 're greeted by a blank wall .
the dressing was a little too vinegary .
the chicken wings were cool too , and we also shared some edamame .
this place is ridiculously expensive .
no thanks , osaka .
i went into osaka last night for some late night sushi with my friends .
the service was just alright .
the rolls were also kind of pricey , even being half off .
they were alright , though .
i was n't impressed at all !
it does n't look very inviting .
that is the only way to describe the experience when you walk in .
so many better late night places in vegas that actually wants repeat business .
however , late night special is cheap .
my boyfriend and i went to osaka to try out their late night menu .
ate here for dinner with a friend around 8pm on jan _num_ .
portions were ok though .
the sushi was descent and the beer selection was great .
when she did finally return , she gave us our check .
will not be coming back .
but this is sushi , not a steakhouse .
i 'd give 1/2 star , but yelp does n't allow that .
what a disappointment !
area of town is sketchy , parking lot feels unsafe after dark .
not going back .
would not visit again !
yesterday i went , and for the first time was disappoint .
sorry to use bad word .
if me , i will tell to customer when i bring drinks to them .
oh you want to eat healthier , it 's gon na cost you !
i 'm not coming back .
no thanks .
not more than a mile from the place it was doing the same thing .
i stopped and turned it off .
i 'm also used to average to better than average takeout food .
do you like ordering a chicken dish and it is mostly vegetables ?
waste of money !
bad bad bad food !
big mistake !
this was more like garlic vegetables !
yuck .
this place is disgusting .
and no !
thankfully the security guard in my building put a stop to it .
_num_ % ?
i guess thinking it might have gotten better the second time around .
i was very wrong !
me and my co-worker called on the phone twice .
for me your bad .
i 'm not blind .
chicken and broccoli was bit salty .
i looked at the website and it seemed super nice .
the place is in a shopping center , a little hard to spot .
it smelled terrible .
went there put $ _num_ in machine .
i ca n't imagine how she works in customer service .
i ordered patty melt , so overdone !
family had fish & chips , very greasy soft and doughy !
ugh .
famous for their _num_ hour specials .
very busy on sundays there may be a wait .
not worth the $ _num_ .
whipped cream that topped the pancakes and waffle : out of a can !
eggs : plain old scrambled eggs , difficult to screw up .
mom in law got _num_ biscuits & gravy w/ sausage and egg .
disappointing .
the _num_ stars is fair for this night .
gag .
uh , no .
i 'm taking off _num_ stars because of this .
it 's hard to keep going back to this place .
she did bring out the check immediately though before we even touched our food .
they are rude !
very generic and boring .
the place was about _num_ % full .
the pancakes were overcooked .
the portion size of his potatoes was small too .
not impressed .
then they were rude .
the chicken was grilled , not fried .
the waffles were a bit overdone , and crunchy on the outside .
they lacked substance .
she said be careful daddy as there are hard things in my meal .
the service was terrible .
they made the request seem so unreasonable .
horrible .
been here _num_ minutes .
no coffee refill yet .
if you do n't like working with the public quit !
chill cheese fries - _num_ star .
it was awkward .
Negative
tonight such a disappointment .
waitress was not interested in serving .
this place was awful .
how do you f up a turkey sandwich !
it was just after all _num_ am .
horrible service .
horrible management .
service is super slow .
it seems that they hired many wait staff without experience .
i also noticed almost half of wait staff is gay .
do n't eat here !
big ol ' portions of greasy diner food .
the only order that was received correctly was the toast .
horrible horrible .
so unfortunate .
she ordered the enchiladas my daughter ordered spaghetti and we shared chicken fajitas .
will not be going back .
pancakes are not great i 've had better .
a place that is very near and dear to his heart .
it took everything in my power to not cause a scene .
you do n't treat people that way .
i 'm so disappointed !
they only accept money orders for rent payment , if that says anything .
my apartment was robbed .
despite the fact they still raised my rent .
the emergency contact number never works after hours .
i 'm hoping this makes someone hop to it .
first time , was not good .
she said no problem .
the teacher did _num_ % of the work .
so i guess it really depends .
i went here today for a cut , high lights and low lights .
i signed in at the counter and was greeted by a student shortly after .
but she knew nothing .
excuse me ?
then re wet my hair to cut it !
omg worst service ever .
ill be calling corporate later today .
bottom line : there are definitely better cleaners around .
it 's less than a _num_ minute process .
luckily the local health department has a clinic that only charges $ _num_ .
i thought it was temporary , and i wish i never took it .
i understand that typically doctors offices are n't quick and they do require patience .
they are just not organized .
no class whatsoever .
horrible .
called like _num_ people before me .
they need help .
terrible service .
mind u drove all the way there again .
just completely rude and unorganized .
she did n't have a reply .
it took me forever just to find a pump for a football .
false !
crappy service .
im eating mexican food , i expect it to be spicy !
unfortunately not .
talk about annoying .
the other two models the agent sent me never responded to my numerous emails .
will never see your money .
i _num_ % agree with standards h. on this agency .
not kind .
not professional .
it was a little busy .
i purchased groupon for the gel manicure and pedicure .
it was not worth the drive .
that 's ridiculous .
never going back !
definetly not coming back .
why did n't i get one ?
also , i think the place deserves a little clean up .
overall , it was an okay experience .
so , i bought a membership because i saw they other perks .
she replied `` it 's not us , it 's the airlines '' .
absolutely no stars !
this review is of aaa in general , not a specific agent .
do not go thru this office !
yes , please , i would love to stand in _num_ for two hours .
stay away !
since then this location has went through an extensive renovation with remodeling .
food was passable , while service was tolerable .
there is always a problem .
scam scam scam shady place .
not too happy .
makes me wonder how they keep their location in the orleans ?
nothing to brag about .
they have lobster tails , grilled or boiled .
my wife had the wedge salad and boneless wings which were both okay .
she happily removed _num_ bucks off our tab .
this server needs to be in the kitchen she 's not a people person .
never will i return ever .
went with a party of _num_ and had an okay experience .
waitress came out with waters but kept forgetting our other drinks .
no refills .
management is horrible !
i do not recommend at all !
idiots .
the place was really busy for a sunday night .
and the boneless wings where over fried .
never returning to this location or maybe any location again .
it was like pulling teeth trying to get simple things like refills and utensils .
bad service .
baked potato with the works on side .
this location in particular always seems extremely short staffed .
i had to ask _num_ different employees for silverware .
this place is horrible .
i am hoping to update this review sometime soon .
never , never again !
horrible service !
worst ever !
unacceptable .
i expressed my concern to our waiter .
this is just terrible .
i 'm so disappointed .
geez and i am still here waiting .
yuck , yuck , yuck .
we all ordered waters and a couple beers on draft .
just bland .
but she never checked on us .
such a disappointing experience .
appetizers were fine , our server was attentive and polite .
i walk in and theres a sign up sheet .
service is slow .
place is run down .
every time i went in i was helped quickly and politely .
those days are over .
what a horrible experience !
the worse place ever .
do n't try to cheat me !
one plus is that they have a wide selection of glasses and sunglasses .
rude customer service .
rude and very unprofessional .
never ever going here again .
that 's horrific , .
i 'm gon na change my optometrist office .
i guess that 's the first sign of trouble .
worst restaurant ever .
this restaurant does not even deserve _num_ star !
the service was horrible .
( haha yelp took the words right out of my mouth ) .
service was n't the greatest either .
the wine chicken was dry .
horrible service !
the only place open today before _num_ .
not good at all .
my parents also kept asking for soup spoons .
she is basically driving customers away .
the other two in my party wanted something not so spicy .
reading the newspaper .
had a party of _num_ this weekend in the private room .
avoid avoid avoid .
it 's like they were trying to draw attention to it .
secondly , w t f ?
seemed to want to sell liquor !
f this shit .
lastly , on the bill , they add in their own `` gratuity '' .
nowhere is this posted on the menu or signage .
i will not recommend this restaurant .
service was extremely slow .
i could have done better .
just update , new management , maybe new owner .
walked in to find only one other couple in this large restaurant .
place smelled sour inside , restaurant was dingy .
btw , way to much mayo on the honey walnut shrimp .
and they add tips in your bill regardless how you like the service .
use yelp , people .
horrible experience .
how shame on them !
we so regretted to have visited this place .
this is really rude .
next on my list was the salty rice roll .
_num_ star .
when we left i wrote an appropriate tip amount ( _num_ % ) .
ridiculous !
total fucking bullshit .
the service is horrible .
service was n't so great .
they should call this `` fried rice '' white rice with peas .
looked awful , boring and bland .
as was the case with the tofu meal ordered by someone else .
the kicker came with the bill , three glasses of wine $ _num_ .
she was taking orders , getting drinks , cleaning table , etc .
no flavor , no taste .
breakfast is available from _num_ am to _num_ pm .
disappointed !
what a terrible experience !
came here over christmas break _num_ with the family .
lukewarm , not cold .
quite boring .
did n't even have green onions .
mixed noodles ( ) : where are the noodles ?
nasty people .
the service is horrible !
will not be back here ever .
but the prices were higher than that of other restaurants .
and price is too high .
also ask soup and noodle separate apart .
i will give this place _num_ star .
do n't bother !
not impressed .
i really wanted taiwanese breakfast ... so i came here .
the restaurant is really tacky .
first off , it was a dark , odd color .
i 'm sure there are other better experiences out there for chinese .
not the freshest and could improve .
their decor is very old school chinese .
food is awful .
worst .
- grossly overpriced .
- mandatory _num_ % service charge .
omg !
completely waste of money .
everything taste bad .
the food was not fresh .
waiters are really rude .
horrible service .
their fried breadsticks were extremely hard and difficult to chew .
food are ok , portion is relatively big , but very expensive .
will not use for anything else .
i ordered kung pao chicken and my friend ordered cashew chicken .
the soup was very tasty it was a corn based egg drop soup .
$ _num_ for a fried fish .
how pathetic !
i do n't get it .
all the staff were very helpful in making sure i was being helped .
we ordered egg rolls , kung pao shrimp and roasted duck .
i 've never had to work so hard to get to the meat before .
pity .
no such luck .
and not cheap !
not the best way to begin the year of the rabbit .
yes the food did taste good but nothing really stood out .
parking is easy and the wait is n't long .
overrated and overly priced .
i hate when that happens .
i asked the server if the green beans were vegetarian and she confirmed .
gross .
i immediately stopped eating .
totally disappointed .
flavor of food is just ok.
looking for a straight forward chinese food meal .
we were n't offered any chopsticks ... because we are american .
that being said , the combination dry fat rice noodle dish was delicious .
it tasted the way i like it cooked .
it was our least favorite dish .
our service was terrible .
i would not go back .
avoid !
joyful for who ?
money , not well spend .
the service is absolute shit .
went there following yelp reviews for lunch .
just bad !
had the hot and sour soup .
so nasty !
worst customer service ever !
horrible food .
we could n't even finish the soup .
our other dish was chicken chow fun the rice noodles .
another lousy dish .
the food was n't great .
the meat in both dishes was slimy and soft .
will not be returning .
dinner was all oil coated .
i 'm very disappointed .
service was horrible !
most chinese restaurants have a fair to good lunch menu but not joyful house .
prices were a little more expensive compared to similar chinese restaurants along spring mountain .
wo n't be back .
customer service is not their priority .
not worth it .
she does n't deserve it .
terrible service !
they have chinese bakery baked stuff individually wrapped to buy .
was n't even good pound cake .
this is las vegas ' version of tea station i guess .
i would definitely pay more for better quality .
_num_ .

_num_ .
yup , it 's more americanized .
not an employee says anything .
alright , well i kinda know when i 'm not welcome .
the milk tea is too sweet too .
i 'll take quickly over this anytime .
the service here is definitely not the best , but it stays pretty busy .
fyi they only accept credit card if you spend over _num_ .
i take it back !
it 's _num_ months later !
not even a thank you .
but the thing that kills this place is the service .
even when they did so , i always seem to get attitude .
they also have a minimum purchase amount for each person at the table .
the food and service here is maybe just a little above average .
i like the taste of there drinks , but i have two complaints .
one , their boba is a hit or miss .
my second issue is how expensive they are .
sorry , tea station .
i really want to say : screw this place !
service is horrible .
i walked out .

the waitress has some attitude problems and she messed up our order .
heck no !
bad food and horrible service !
insane prices for tea , $ 5-7 ?

a slice of bread would offer me better service than this place .
worst service ... .
y'all should get a better ac or something for this place .
employee does n't speak english that well ... .
this place was horrible !
i also tried strawberry and that was also too sweet .
boba : at first , i was delighted .
the texture was great , not overly chewy or too soft .
$ $ $ $ : are they freakin out of their minds ?
they are not realistic at all .
bf and i both ordered our own taro smoothie with pudding .
are they rude ?
_num_ star for quality .
to-go service is a joke .
they do n't explain things well .
takes a lot to put me over the edge .
this is my second time coming here and i dont plan coming back .
just beyond rude !
i would n't go back .
even though they offer free wi-fi , it never works .
the price is more expensive too .
it 's not cause they were busy .
horrible service .
been going here for _num_ years and it has n't changed .
when we walked in , it was a little busy .
overly priced , for sure .
visited this tea station for the first time in vegas .
not a good business practice .
not a fan .
or lack there of .
once they handed us our drinks , it was a different story .
worst decision .
nothing works .
try volcano tea house or fresh cup down the street .
i really do n't like this place .
i dont normally post any reviews for anything .
big mistake .
gross .
it is way over priced .
they are so rude .
go to icy juicy down the street , it is much much better .
this place is ridiculous .
worst service ever .
service is really bad .
the owner really need to fire all these kids !
that 's no excuse .
so stock it !
tonight was packed .
i said my bf is picking me up i 'll get cash from him .
this place sucks .
our party of _num_ ordered popcorn chicken and different kinds of drinks .
tell me i 'm not expecting too much here .
but it 's okay , we asked for some .
ugh , skimpy much ?
only here because someone else wants boba .
gross .
luckily my boba was delicious or i 'd burn this place to the ground .
and then he walked away .
gross .
i hate this place .
worst service ever !
this place has the most expensive boba in las vegas .
after they get you your drinks , they pretty much forget you ever existed .
because it was not even that busy .
bad service .
we walked in and were greeted .
i was like , are you serious ?
taking my business elsewhere !
however , the drinks are sketchy today .
i 'm not going again !
very bad service .
there was a wall with lots of tea displayed that caught my attention though .
the prices for the drinks are overpriced to me .
$ _num_ for two drinks .
it was a little pricey and the grass jelly was just alright .
their service is terrible .
i 've been here about _num_ times and never by my own free will .
disappointed !
worst customer service ever .
food is awesome !
... service two thumbs down !
no personality !
me and my husband hate the food here .
no flavor and no taste .
but we only like the drinks and desserts .
only one server run the whole restaurant .
and the service is lower than the standard .
i 've been a customer of tea station for _num_ years now .
chinese ) blah blah blah '' and laughing forever about it .
i ordered pho , the house phone with rice noodles .
bad experience .
bad experience .
service is very sub par .
overall , if you 're just dropping by to get drinks , go ahead .
we found stinky smell from the table .
the milk tea is alright , taste a bit water down .
very poor service .
for thai tea .
`` _num_ minutes . ''
it was so gross .
no no no .
no boba .
crappy tea .
very bad service .
i mean , really ?
the boba was still frozen and was super hard to get down .
i hate this place !
not this place !

management doesnt care either .
a bunch of cheap chinese shit heads here !
but seriously go to icy juicy instead !
he brought the same if not better quality for less !
customer service is nonexistent .
they were given .
each time i go , i can never find parking .
also , you can not park in the chinatown plaza parking next door .
will not be back .
this place is ridiculous !
former tea station lv customer .
terrible !
too expensive !
customer service needs improvement .
i would not recommend this school .
but still had lessons with _num_ instructors both were professional , friendly and helpful .
which brings me to my next problem .
could not recommend .
crap .
gave it a fair try .
wo n't go back .
horrible place !
then i find out natalie moved to san francisco .
i 'm like okay this is taking a long time .
i did that , and you know what i got ?
because _num_ % of $ _num_ = $ _num_ .
so , onto the second try with this same salon .

worst vacation ever .
that is your training class for fat tuesdays .
you are now certified as a fat tuesday bartender .
ok -- - fat tuesday = not a bar .
`` yea and can i get one for my girlfriend too ?
it gets worse .
apparently this location needs to die .
as i walked around , the lights suddenly came on .
there was an awesome chicken cookie jar there that i had my eye on .
sad experience .
horrible experience !
long story short .
however , i will say that her treatments were effective .
worst experience .
crappy people .
carmax .
i bought my newest car here as well as get my services done too .
so i 'm thankful .
in a rude tone .
wrong !
regardless , a customer is a customer and a sale is a sale .
i am a yelper !
this car was inspected one week prior !
complete waste of time .
left without looking around .
this was very disappointing .
i purchased my car here in _num_ .
i purchased a new car _num_ weeks ago .
ok , another one week passed , i received one email from one agency .
it is too different as what they expressed to sell your car previously .
not the best korean food on the planet .
i walked in , it was an average size , nice colors .
avoid this place !

the office staff of this location should be fired immediately .
i 'll find someone else for my annual .
very irritating .
then they rescheduled my appt due to doctor leaving office to deliver a baby .
anyone else in this position i really advise caution .
it takes as long though .
terrible service .
first time at this location and it will be my last .
horrible service and bad attitude .
this is really typical of the service i 've come to expect at lowes .
Positive
i had to be done , so i patiently went thru the steps .
finally an installation technician , patrick , arrived at _num_ pm that day .
there is a reason why `` specialists '' exist .
are you kidding me ?
you have been warned .
i felt very unsafe here .
there was a man cooking at the grill and a woman behind the counter .
customer service is non existent and their prices are unreasonable .
do not recommend them to anyone .
not modern tech at all .
so , im having kinda of a rough start to my _num_ day weekend .
i went with eggs , over hard and bacon .
hole in the wall but somewhere to fall asleep .
it 's in a very busy place .
then , we checked the bed .
your belongings will be stolen as soon as you leave the room .
the room was terrible .
bad .
very bad .
this place was horrible .
got there at _num_ am and exhausted .
the third room smelt like someone died in it .
horrible motel and horrible service .
wow , this liquor store is filled with cigarette smoke .
dean martin never drank here , for a reason .
$ _num_ was what was charged .
if you do n't like it , quit .
you 're losing customers .
top lv dive bar is not deserved .
not ok .
rude to larger groups .
the neighborhood is sketchy anyways .
probably wo n't return .
wrong .
walked out never to return .
i get it , you only like locals .
i leave you and your two customers alone .
my mom , stepped in between us to stop .
i was sure she was going to kick his ass !
i wish she would have !
checked my credit card the next day and was billed $ _num_ .
not pleased .
Neutral
do n't judge me ! )
the first bad sign ?
only finished 1/4 of them .
no sorry not good .

the service is horrible .
this place is mexican food for people from ohio .
this place was super dam american like really chicken tenders ?
the service was terrible .
sad sad sad .
not good .
honestly , i make better chicken tortilla soup .
all i could do was laugh during the ceremony .
unacceptable !
- '' yea , they are n't here yet .
they fill out the paperwork , pay , and then wait .
the photographer took every pic straight on .
boy were we disappointed !
the limo driver gets a tip .
the worst part ?
rude rude rude !
shame on you !
so , would not recommend .
rude , inconsistent and false advertising .
Very negative
vegas may be cheesy , but it 's better than this .
this place was a complete let down .
just because i got it for free my reservation does n't count ?
i 'm going through with it but this is bs !
i was transferred to _num_ different people and had to keep explaining this .
i do n't recommend them .
horrible customer service .
the room was okay .
similar rates were available in nearby downtown ( fremont hotel , etc ) .
ghetto as hell !
desk staff was friendly .
i kept my flip flops on , even in the shower !
would n't recommend this place .
big mistake .
this hotel is gross !

im not a fan at all .
disappointed .

i do not recommend this shop .
i do not recommend !
we walked in this shop on the strip .
me and my sister also both had problems with tissue and healing issues .
i really did n't want too .
got cold looks from all of the tattoo artists there .
i understand wanting to make a profit on something .
be careful when coming in here .
i recently just had one of my firearms in this store .
unbelievable .
do n't be fooled by the nice beds and sheets .
surely i will not come back .
bf got chicken and waffles .
waiters and waitresses literally running around everywhere except to their tables .
i personally feel like a school cafeteria is better than this place .
apparently everyone else knew better .
avoid at all costs .
there is nothing positive to say about this buffet .
it was just `` ok '' food , i 've had better for sure .
no such luck .
this place is very ordinary even though they served snow crab legs during breakfast .
how lazy .
horrible .
my husband and i ate here during our recent trip to vegas .
terrible , awful , disgusting .
mediocre food .
they were very rude !
it 's cheap , but you pay for what it 's worth .
the food choices and quality have not changed .
it 's just that very little of it is any good at all .
it was pretty empty .
the waiter and manager are extremely mean to customer s and guests .
very low end buffet .
they 're not even trying .
worse mistake of the trip .
i usually write lengthy reviews , but this will be short .
the food was dry and not good .
i dined here basically out of convenience during a stay at the stratosphere .
hold it , stop stop stop the press !
no i would n't .
not good at all !
went there for dinner tonight !
a baked potato was cold .
very limited seafood selection which is weird .
free food so why not .
would not recommend !
horrible food .
everything they are serving is old .
disgusting food .
cold , and old .
limited selection and food was just so-so .
would not recommend it .
i really do n't like this buffet .
even the chinese buffet near the gas station is better than this one .
wait in line to enter a very loud , busy , environment .
the food is like diner food but a bit over priced .
this was probably around _num_ pm on a wednesday .
but i know that 's their thing there so others may really like it .
do not go this place !
ok , if there 's nothing else open .
this place is conveniently located in the stratosphere .
food was only decent , ihop quality , which is n't great quality .
breakfast was fine , but expensive .
i wish i just had the buffet again .
our waitress spent more time singing than actually waiting on us and other guests .
beers around $ _num_ .
there 's even a charge for to go orders .
incredibly slow .
very bad customer service .
we ate here twice , once for dinner and once for breakfast .
would not recommend to anybody !

the frys were also dry and cold .
even my salad had chunks of yellow iceberg lettuce .
even the entertainment sucked .
very bad experience .
so disgusting !
for example , $ _num_ will get you _num_ alright onion rings .
service was very slow .
i ordered eggs benedict and my husband ordered a burger .
just go for the shakes not the food .
gross !
not even close to good .
i could n't eat them .
it is just an ok place if you sober .
our waiter was so confusing !
the food was super yummy though .
chili cheese fries mmmm !
eggs , cold .
so i sent my meal back .
at this point i just gave up .
this guy was slow .
waitress was n't very pleasant .
servers seemed very tired .
the service was horrible .
my girlfriend asked for mayo got none .
i asked for cheese got none .
i would not recommend coming here .
waited another _num_ min for our drinks .
terrible dining experience .
rating below _num_ star .
we ordered the philly cheese steak , hawaiian burger and turkey sandwich .
i could squeeze the grease from them .
ordered the french dip and chicken buffalo bites .
overall , bad experience .
this was one of my least favorite meals i ate in las vegas .
the sausage was diced up brown and serve sausages .
they were accompanied by one celery stick and one carrot .
nachos sucked too .
normally have no complaints .
tonight was different .
the service was terrible .
i had my own cup and i just needed some hot water .
they wanted to charge me $ _num_ .
this place sucked .
not worth going to .
i came in for the graveyard special - _num_ burgers with bacon , etc .
it felt and tasted like rubber !
nasty .
gross .
not a good start .
it was the most ghetto thing i 've ever seen a diner do .
nothing fit like a burger and i ended up eating it piece by piece .
i was very displeased so was the other _num_ people i was with .
no tip left .
the worst customer service .
poor service and unprofessional staff .
wait time was ridiculous .
was not worth the wait .
awful .
i ordered the chicken philly which was pretty good .
our waitress was really personable and outgoing .
i ca n't recall her name but she was awesome .
i ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and vegetables .
but i guess one should expect that in vegas .
the sin city burger was decent .
could use a little more lighting though .
the fries were good too ... i guess .
it was pretty gross .
it 's pretty filling , but not fulfilling .
it was a little overpriced for what it was .
if you have the patience , you should try better places .
very disappointed .
the restaurant only had a few people at tables when we got there .
there 's no point .
without them forgetting my fries or onion rings .
i just walked out .
let me remind you , i 'm on my lunch .
_num_ min lunch .
horrible service .
the owner needs new employees at this location .
first impression not a very welcoming place .
it seemed like everyone who walked in after us was being called before us .
i got so much to say about it !
i came in with lots of concern , and left wanting to kill myself !
this places is horrible !
my wait time is going on _num_ hrs .
_num_ busboy , _num_ waitress .
so not worth it .
service at this denny 's was dismal .
food was mediocre .
we walked out .
it was n't even that packed .
am i just old school when it comes to denny 's ?
worst dennys ever .
the coffee was terrible .
it was at least _num_ hours old .
she did this at least _num_ times .
he must !
bad indeed !
they are not gods .
luv-it frozen custard was recommended .
cheap ?
i tell you , this place is not a hidden gem .
it 's just not worth it !
the peanuts were more like saw dust .
from then on , i became obsessed with finding custard .
mint chip - underwhelming .
not impressed .
i ordered chocolate and it tastes like bananas .
horrible customer service .
the second time i came here was with my boyfriend .
they only had 4-5 flavors .
if you are a custard fan , i would suggest here .
limited selection of flavors .
i will not be coming back .
none found so off we went .
mine was around $ _num_ and had caramel , fudge and pecans .
the consistency is a little different and the flavors are much too sweet .
when i asked him the same question before they had opened .
i really miss it too .
the blueberry tasted artificial .
i would not go back .
luv it or leave it ?
disappointing .
someone else owns it and runs it now .
the vanilla tasted artificial and the sundae was way to sweet for my taste .
sad sad sad what a shame !
tonight was probably my last time going there .
i was really disappointed .
sad to report this .
i went here again today because it was hot as # $ % # .
i have been coming here for the last _num_ years , changes are ok !
sooo i have been going to luv it for years .
its just gross now .
i 'm really into ice cream and was expecting decent soft serve .
please stop trying to save a buck and cut corners .
i have been a customer of luv it for _num_ years .
i would n't wait for it anymore .
what a bummer , this was a date night ending spot too .
unfortunately we were sorely disappointed .
the custard was nothing like we expected .
i just wonder if they 've ever actually had good frozen custard before .
the mattresses have a noisy plastic cover under the sheet .
the neighborhood is really really sketchy .
no internet .
no frills .
my response `` none , im going to costco . ''
i ordered a pizza for delivery to my hotel on my trip to vegas .
my work has ordered over _num_ times & every time is the same way .
worst experience ever !
and slow .
i like that their onion rings are battered rather than breaded .
i made sure they delivered to my work before i ordered .
i have to say that there are pros and cons to this place .
the delivery man was even less thrilled about his job too .
Negative
pizza is too greasy .
used to come here back in _num_ and the food was great .
!
pizza toppings all tossed in the middle .
fries soggy as hell serious ?
give me money gone .

giving _num_ stars just because they delivered .
delivery includes only one pepper and one parmesan cheese .

service ... so-so !
the waitresses seemed off in their own world most of the time .
it was however very expensive .
not sure .
i ordered scrambled eggs and my boyfriend ordered his over easy .
shortly after that , i finished my plate of food .
very disappointing .
the rice was fluffy , but greasy and overly salty .
the mixed in pieces of peas and potatoes were a nice addition .
is it that difficult to get drink service ?
ick .
um ... no .
one major plus was the mojito !
the appetizer was a fried potato thing .
not exactly generous .
i was confused as hell .
it was weird .
the prices seem to be pricey too .
it is next to the little white wedding chapel though .
_num_ % of your food total whether you like the service or not !
total disappointment .
their sister restaurant ( havana grill ) is much more convenient .
so not worth the money !
Neutral
the service sucked .
it has been better before but never great .

it freaking sucks !
the service was slow .
it was very disappointing .
the food was not memorable .
the service was lousy .
we should have just walked out .
service was terrible .
getting a refill was also a pain .

i think thier just cheap on quality .
it 's a major pain to get in and out of thier weird setup .

really sad .
the wait time is longer than _num_ freaking hours !
so disappointing .

the quality of the items were average to low .
the excitement died upon entering .
i was excited to stop here .

went there to pick up a t shirt for a cousin .
we live in vegas so we were nearby and figured it would be cheap .
i guess somebody does .
not happening .
i asked _num_ different people for help and received _num_ different answers .
hello house of crap .
i ca n't imagine that any of us need any of this stuff .
from the outside , with all the lights i was expecting more .
i made sure to stare them down like they were staring me down .
i think this place could use a lot of improvements .
we begin browsing and i notice this security guard following us around .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
the coolest thing i found was used playing cards from the now closed sahara .
strike _num_ .
is n't vegas the place to get married ?
the prices are low , the options are high .
it does need a bit of updating , though .
you ca n't miss this place .
everything here is junk .
pure junk .
ok , i can understand it 's vegas and drunk people break things .
i can see it being a tourist trap with cheap souvenirs .
gives me the feeling that the owner ( s ) are very cheap .
the place is really dingy and has an overpowering chemical smell .
would n't come here after dark .
more than i paid for the car itself .
i returned and the owner referred me to his personal mechanic .
please avoid this place .
i am ( was ) a big fan of carl 's jr until recently .
horrible customer service .

ridiculous .
bottom line do n't go there .
i was celebrating my bachelorette .

i wish car dealers did this !
is not a very good strip club .
then , my least favorite part .
there was some kind of nonsense going on with credit cards .
oh yea , and they keep your id and credit card .
we spent the entire night laughing .
Positive

not impressed at all .
i could n't believe this .
avoid at all costs !

ugly girls , no .
they place is dirty .
not much else .
you have been warned .
my husband ordered a beer from a waitress , gave her _num_ .

this guy literally fell down drunk and was picked up by og staff .
it is utter disappointment .
it was unbelievable .

the place is sleazy .
first male strip club experience .

i walked into the room upstairs where they have male dancers .
within _num_ minute i was approached by _num_ dancers .
upstairs are male strippers , they are old and look really really low class .
bad business .
only male strip club in lv .
whoever owns this company needs to teach their employees etiquette classes .
the absolute worst .
seriously ?
my wife and i visited this place while in town this past weekend .
we ended up going to sapphire which ended up being a much better experience .
this place is awful .
avoid at all cost .
extremely rude staff .
male dancers were so aggressive & overly hungry for money .
totally lost my business !
they sent a _num_ passenger van to pick us up .
$ _num_ to get in .
no class .
this place is horrible !
in an anxious , mortified , state , i talked with the manager .

you already have a higher status and us ladies have loose pockets !
a little hole-in-the-wall bar with not much to recommend it .

the papaya salad was n't fresh .
sat down & was not even acknowledged .
waiters & waitresses saw us but never once came to our table .
rude .
ah yelp photos let me down .
we got thai beef salad which was okay .
there was pretty much just lettuce and some beef slices .
it was not good .
the portions of chicken and mushroom in here were generous though .
went tonight - party of two .
he ordered curry beef and steamed rice with a side of egg rolls .
would rate a _num_ if we could .
egg rolls were horrible .
$ _num_ total before our $ _num_ restaurant.com coupon .
horrible place to eat .
worst customer service !
everyone who has worked on it says same thing .
my purchases will go back to clark county or aaa .
reading other reviews they also have cockroaches .
i 'm just sleeping in my car next time .
the plumbing is off in the building .
inconsiderate and too ghetto .
price one has too pay for cheap inexpensive motel .
avoid if you can .
however , i got that rate as i booked _num_ months in advance .
nothing really worked at all .
what a terrible choice .
the carpet was atrocious .
room _num_ .
there was nothing .
horrible !
no wonder !
we walked into the restaurant and were greeted by the hostess and promptly seated .
the interior looked classy and was quite spacious .
i would not go back .
it was a $ _num_ discount .

not a sign of freshness .
she said the cuban bread was just french bread and not the real thing .
i soaked off the grease with my napkin .

my water heater went out saturday night .

not all employees are cut out to work in a customer service job .
no a/c .

plus the place needs major tlc .
it was really old and dusty inside .
this place is g h e t o o !
its too dangerous .
like excuse me ?
worst customer service ever !
no return phone calls .
terrible business experience !
customer service is a hit or miss .
these people are worthless .
not professional .
turned me away because i have a service animal .
this place looks like a hole in the wall and it is .
my pedicure consisted of foot soak and scrub then polish .
i went there all excited & bought a big package deal .
unacceptable .
they also hate people with coupons .
i never see any workers on the sales floor to assist customers .
terrible customer service !
head my warning .
avoid these .
they were marked _num_ for $ _num_ , but rang up at regular price .
however at the register it rang up $ _num_ .
that price is n't for those .
the price marketing is a big problem in this store .
not even close .
just pathetic .
ridiculous .
it 's depressing .
( the selection at target makes this one laughable . )
this store is awful .
he was not .
ok , whatever .
so , it has n't been worth coming here at that time .
it was bad !
so , they all had a long way to go .
kmart & sears are owned by the same corporation .
every time i break down and go in , i always regret it .
there is always a problem at the register .
after buying them , the lady starts walking away .
luckily , taking it slowly we made it to las vegas .
however , i can say it will be the last .
all i ask is ready my review , and make your own decision .
we scheduled the appointment a few days prior to me being in town .
why send me to the manager and a salesman ?
that really turned us off .
extremely bad customer service !
the oil filter is loose !
your techs should double or triple check everything !
after that , nothing worked out well .
unbelievable !
went to findlay very helpful and respectful .
no charge .
and want me to buy a new tire .
the car had _num_ mile .
this is ridiculous .
Negative
but this place suck big time .
the price is _num_ $ now .
spent _num_ hours to wait until my car was done .
and as a result - oil was everywhere !
everywhere under the hood , engine was covered with oil .
my wife took our vehicle in to get _num_ tire replaced .
so pretty much i could of save $ _num_ by going with discount tire .
order the part , maybe _num_ mins .
under normal conditions this can take 1-2 weeks driving around town .
that 's the nicest word i can use to sum up our evening .
the hostess forgot the menus , so those were brought separately .
the manager just sat him back down next to me .
all this for $ _num_ plus tip ?
talk about not meeting your expectations !
we used capitol north american to move our household from las vegas to seattle .

this one is close to my house so i tried it out today .
hire some more people owner ( s ) you are only hurting yourself .
they send me to the jiffy lube on charleston and _num_ .
but i am blown away that i have had to deal with this .
this is how you loose customers .
i would n't trust this location .
they just seemed focused on speed , not precision or customer care .
really never coming here again .
not good at all .
waste of time .
rang a week prior to see if i needed an appointment .
then said bye and walked off .
disappointing .
this location is trash .
i only wished i had heard about it before i went to him .
the worst place ever !
( my tips were very narrow at the bottom ) .
horrible place !
this place sucks .

i 've had much better at the taco trucks in la .
chicken tacos : not so good .
not cool .
service : slow .
i try to love los tacos , i really do .
even though los tacos is one of my favorite taco stands in las vegas .
i was very impressed with the tacos .
the first time i tried this place i went to the drive through .
not being very honest if you ask me .
( no connection ) .
apparently , it 's salt .
how bad was it ?
this is the 3rd time , i 'm done .
so disappointing .
not worth it .
employees acting like they 're working for free .
no se .
but that bad decision .
the food is not as good as other places .
had high hopes with the reviews i had seen on yelp .
i ordered the carne asada and carnitas tacos .
no thanks .
the taco was good but price was out of range .
high prices go even higher ordering `` everything '' .
anyways did n't feel like arguing .
when i see my burrito all it consisted of was literally beef and rice !
do n't be fooled .
rip-off alert !
talked to manager who just said that 's their system .
i said but it says $ _num_ .
i was so disappointed !

there was _num_ barbers doing absolutely nothing .
bad business ethics .
in the last year we had a minor electrical problem .
the problem was solved .
i hate these people .
a while later , a gentleman showed up and inspected the house .
none will be renewed .
they 're only in business to collect your $ _num_ service call fees .
they did n't care one bit !
garbage !
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
i have a contract with national home warranty for a year .
my air conditioner quit july 2nd and tech responded to the claim july 5th .
the contractor is calling to schedule a time to install a new compressor .
the tech was in the hospital ; he 'd been in an accident .
suggest you save your money .
i think , ok , they are passing the buck already .
he has the $ _num_ check though .
they are rude and unprofessional .
lousy warranty .
lousy customer service .
goodbye very soon , national home warranty .
fyi they made _num_ trade call visits in two years to fix the unit .
in the past _num_ years their service was good , never any problems .

waste of money .
wish there was actually a minus star rating and mine would be a _num_ .
not kidding either !
beware and go elsewhere !
it 's _num_ degrees plus .
this place is terrible .
ca n't get it .
most of the time they operate at a fairly tolerable level .
plus i just had major surgery .
not surprising they are not a bbb rated company .
it is a total con .
thankfully we bought all our new appliances ( _num_ ) at lowes .
and offered only _num_ credit .
honey you are not intimidating anyone especially if i can sit on you .

i sit patiently staring at my food .
i ate the shrimp out of it and left everything else .
started off with fried wontons .
but service was slow .
_num_ star for komol ?

hire a car and see the dam on your own .

barry emailed me a quote of more than double the original price !
i swear on my life this is _num_ % true story .
Neutral
how cheap can they bee !
all of her guest were coming from california .
she had all the paperwork set for her chosen date and paid a deposit .
she had someone else handle the job for her .
so this may be the reason .
getting information on flowers is nearly impossible .
hard to believe they were ever rated number _num_ .
then came the nightmare !
so about _num_ months before the wedding we booked it and paid in full .

my kids were not happy .
this place is horrible .
this time i needed a quick side to my meal at home .
so decided to stop and get _num_ large sides of mashed potatoes and gravy .
( $ _num_ ) on my way home .
either from not having enough pieces of original recipe chicken to complete my order .
to seriously long waits at the register .
i did not get a receipt or anything .
just a note - others seemed to enjoy themselves and like the food .
restaurant smells bad .
the rice was stinky and the salad was a little old .
this is not authentic japanese food !
toro was not toro .
some waitress were even cleaning tables while i was waiting to be served .
the korean bbq restaurant is next door and kitchen is same for both .
this is not authentic japanese .
after we finished our entre , we were surprised that dessert was still included .
cold food- cold .

the chefs where rude .
this place is nasty !

they should be embarrassed .
prices were the same , though .

what 's one half of one half ?
ive gotten three piercings and two tattoos from jesse .
he told me to get over it .
been going there for over _num_ years before he become the manager .
will not go back .
but even that fell a little short of my expectations .
no stars !
the bathroom was clean , shower was fine .
fyi , i have yet to receive an actual bill .
there is nothing `` professional '' about this business .
i could not believe it .
simply unbelievable that this place can even be in business .
i just recently went here with my hubs and mom .
first off , they make you get a tray .
so gross !
first , the rice .
i never had and now i know why .
i was so disappointed .
this tends to be a hit or miss whenever i visit .
it just happened to be a bit of a miss the last time .
not enough vinegar .
this is just another typical filipino restaurant you 'd find in any other city .
food is adequate to satisfy the appetite .
line moved really slow .
bad system .
food was mediocre .
food quality was not good .
not worth driving from summerlin .
been going there for the past _num_ years .
this place sucked .
the minute we walked in the place had a funky smell .
the nurse took my blood pressure and gave me a gown .
i normally do not do reviews .
do n't let your baby get stress !
i 've been here twice .
so , that 's why i 've only been a patient once .
this hospital sucks .
just horrible !
the nurses were miserable .
how awful .
they looked , agreed it was drugs , and kept walking .
it was horrible .
and very cold .
a nightmare !
i 'm sorry .
what i witnessed was unbelievable !
but hello , do you think the administration cares ?
so many nurses have quit .
i am in the medical field in san diego , like i stated above .
it 's obvious administration only cares about the money they make .
nurses are so rude .
worst hospital ever !
yesterday i picked up a hard printed copy of my medical records .
yesterday i picked up a hard printed copy of my medical records .
shame on you !
do not go to this hospital .
i was there for surgery on monday june 20th .
so rude and unprofessional .
not trained at all to care for surgery patients .
i 've tried the pizza and ziti .
the mushrooms and meatball toppings were sliced razor thin .
do n't eat here !
horrible , horrible !
seriously zero stars !
i went with the spicy chicken pizza roll that someone on yelp mentioned .
maybe it was n't my taste .
eh , it was okay .
might have been better if we had eaten there instead of delivery .
had a pizza , the spaghetti with sausage , side salads and garlic knots .
disappointing .
if you want amazing wings , go to twin peaks .
def not ordering again .
so instead of waiting i substituted one for a regular slice .
been here about _num_ times in the last year .
one of the best slices of pizza i could find in las vegas .
the wings were tiny and incredibly overdone .
the crust was mediocre .
i lived here from feb _num_ - june _num_ .
it became very rowdy , very fast .
also the place is roach infested .
they are disgusting .
i pretty much hate going into this store .
ive ordered from here several times and never had a problem up until recently .
my dish was a bit salty for my taste .
what gives ?
used to be good management .
raised the rent too much .
this is not a regular costco !
no alcohol sold here .
thumbs down !
!
business owners want to eat hot dogs and pizza , too .
if you open carry make sure to leave it in your car .
once in that room i saw a nurse , she was nice .
horrible .
i hate this guy !
could n't that have waited ?
i waited _num_ hours for this ?
this doctor is horrible .
no customer service whatsoever .
was n't even greeted .
still was n't checked on .
got there at 10pm and it was closed and the workers were long gone .
can i get to that rack so i can find my size ?
the checkout line is like w mile long , but it goes pretty quickly .
it was loud , crowded , and messy .
ew , ew , ew brothers is all i can say .
but no call .
lazy , bad customer service .
horrible customer service !
he saved me _num_ dollars .
it was there _num_ % .
these people do n't even deserve one star !

had our company van stolen , and this is where it ended up .

horrible horrible horrible customer service !
not hanging up , not saying a word , just silence for a minute .
terrible , terrible customer service !
would i recommend this paper ?
at least once a month our sunday paper is not delivered to us .
so much for reading the paper while drinking your morning coffee .
you wait to get you paper on tuesday , .
no paper again .
wrong answer .
hell no .
yea , i really want to see all the crime over there .
las vegas is a large enough city - it should be better served .
they could just never deliver my paper consistently .
i contacted them before i moved to try and get tv and internet service .
any call you make to them goes directly to voicemail .
so i fill out the packet completely .
i get a police report , get documents , etc .
the letter is returned to me .
i only wish you would go with them .
so often i just stop calling and fix it myself .
all of a sudden it starts to play some french film .
cox i hate you !
to get more it 's $ _num_ a month !
recently tried cable card .
really , if you want high speed internet do you have an alternative ?
cox is trash .
are you kidding me ?
we went to same location , and saw juan .
hubby n i are not the hard customers type .
they just stole $ _num_ from us .
hard to trust people these days .
this is just for the whole management of cox services in las vegas .
cox is just like any oil company that pops in your head .
in los angeles , you can get both cable and internet for that price .
i really really hate cox .
there is a definite problem with cox in las vegas and their price packages .
yes , as soon as possible , switching over !
sounds like cox is hurting for business ... .
but i opted to chat with with tech support .
this is painful .
this is complete bs .
plain and simple .
cox is a freaking joke .
i just need to add my staff to access the account from customer service .
you will loose me as a customer very soon if not improved .
per month for phone and internet for _num_ months now .
Neutral
why so us customers , paying customers have to deal with this ?
the bad .
each and every time i call , i am told something completely different .
completely ridiculous !
i recently upgraded my internet speed on cox to their fastest speed .
mine is not .
do n't let these guys out of your house without checking the internet speed .
with all of this , the installers were polite and reasonable .
i signed up for cox internet and basic cable television .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the fix worked and my internet speed increased significantly .
i will be switching from cox this week .
what the hell !
so im being charged to install it myself ?
truly ridiculous .
no help at all .
is this how cox does business ?
somebody from cox needs to care enough to help resolve this issue .
have to keep internet , but come on $ _num_ before taxes for tv ?
if you have another choice for cable service , pick it !
so another visit from a tech .
what a crappy company !
she worked with my needs and was accommodating .
they promised me they would fix it .
what horrible customer service .
first , i had problems with my internet connection with cox for years .
phone ... no .
the service is spotty and the connection is never stable .
not one dropped connection !
i have cox high speed internet preferred in las vegas .
during the transfer , i was disconnected .
not so after you are a customer .
las vegas valley really needs some competition in the cable internet service .
do n't let cable companies have there way .
only ... i returned it .
that being said , vegas could really use some competition here for internet service .
now my bill is over $ _num_ .
bad business .
cox is a ripoff !
i beg of you to hire employees with some type customer service background !
if your internet does go down , almost once a month for me .
oh , we do n't carry the original boxes here .
my problem is with the cable .
so i am trying to catch up with new resident fees and etc .
but i ask all of you this , as a fellow consumer .
saving over _num_ a month since removing them from my home .
worst mistake !
well i was wrong .
cox cable is a joke .
ridiculous prices for crappy service .
but that is not the case .
they dont deserve a star .
cox sucks cox .
cable side , we watching movies then all sudden screen gets freeze .
their billing is not organized .
i called them on it , you call them on it .
it 's all about the money with these clowns , nothing more .
and when i say money , i mean lots of it .
it 's _num_ guys , get with it already .
terrible in every way .
and they are always raising my rates .

wrong !
so it does n't matter what office .
the sales associate sucks !
this place is like the used car dealership of furniture stores .

this was my only day off in the past three months .
typical commission sales job not caring at all about the customer .
stupid .
it will be a very long time before i return to walker .
nobody has contacted me even after you said you would here on yelp .
i like the sales man but management is lying about things .
please tell your employees to stop following people around .
it 's too aggressive .
this is the 2nd time i have been treated this way at walker .
victor walked by me again , says did you find what you want ?

these people are incompetent .
i bought a sectional sofa on july 3rd and paid for the delivery .
i did nothing wrong .
two girls with head gear of some sort were standing chatting with each other .
i asked one wear the checkout counter was and they pointed the way .
we have gone to walker furniture before and have never had a problem before .
this is unacceptable .
they are dishonest .
bad customer service !
bad service !
your choice , but i say , do n't shop there !
during the purchase process , the salesman daniel matthews was very helpful .
i was treated much better by the ashley staff !
i ca n't say i recommend them , based on the above experiences .

she kept pushing me out of the store just after i checked .
moreover , they required me to provide my email address .
bad cheese , perhaps ?

over priced .
worst service ever .
if i could not give a star i would .

management or the owner really need to fix this place .

so i went the next day and same story .
the chicken was dry .
unacceptable !
horrible service .
horrible customer service .
no such luck !
the catfish is terrible .
i rolled down my window and gave the man ten bucks .
i 'm not trying to get shot because you want to eat .
just hop out the car and run inside and get your food and leave .
okra tasted old and dried out .
fried chicken was standard .
i went on a weekday around 4pm .
i stood there for almost _num_ mins .
will not be going back !

my boyfriend and i stopped in to get a quick bite to eat .
their restaurant was n't that crowded .
never been at a restaurant where you do that .
my boyfriend 's was not .
i do n't care .
wall knocked down between the cafe and casino .
it is really loud .
burger king makes an ok jr spicy chicken sandwich .
the nuggets were cold .
wrong .
oh well , guess it 's time for another vet .
they would n't help me .
are you kidding me ?
absolute worst service .
tremendously long wait .
poor people stuck behind me .

not to mention in a very rough location .
_num_ ) nobody in that office waiting room but me had insurance .
_num_ ) nobody in that hospital procedure waiting room but me had insurance .
i had to go to .
horrible place .
terrible experience with payment .
to me , a starbucks is a starbucks is a starbucks .
they 've always seemed well staffed ( at least _num_ working ) .
normally , i am pretty pleased with customer service at starbucks .
i will admit the morning staff are very friendly .
i miss my old starbucks !
first , i ordered my standard grande americano .
my coffee was pretty good .
you can not access the bathrooms without a code .
this makes ordering here impossible for me .
first , this place is located in a gas station .
the enchilada sauce also needed some spice .
maybe only send one employee on break at a time ?
very disappointing and frustrating .
excuse me ?
never going back .
this is the 2nd time this location has messed up my order .
she also stated nobody called the store an hour and a half .
if this were the only smith 's in town it would be closed .
why do they hire folks that dont care about their job ?
she gave me details on what to ask for when i got in .
waste of my time !
stopped by the deli for some deli meats and cheese .
never had an issue or been asked that before .
she cut them , showed me and they were fine .
however , in the evenings there is only self checkout available .
there is wal-mart about _num_ blocks away , which has much better prices anyway .
i have convinced few others not to shop at smith 's .
i have shopped at smith 's at rancho & charleston for over _num_ years .
my practice has been to check dates on everything .
i took a picture and then talked to chris , operations assistant manager .
he told me that they would take cart out of service .
to get my families lunch needs taking care of .
and then the next week it close at _num_ pm .
it would change depending on the employee .
customer service is a huge aspect of grocery stores .
but i shopped again because of this deal for buy _num_ save _num_ $ .
but today is frustrating .
but it was still too big when i put it on the next day .
it 's not the money my bf paid .
more like _num_ stars for this establishment .
what a disappointment .
i could purchase that for at least $ _num_ less at whole foods .
too bad .
lame .
not a kids friendly urgent care .
i waited about _num_ hours .
they are so bad .
the disaster started quickly .
are you afraid you 're going to get in trouble ? ''
he replied , `` i get in a lot of trouble .
i 'm not worried about you '' .
i will not be returning .
i called sw to reschedule my appt .
they did n't even care .
no way .
he ca n't talk , drink , or eat .
_num_ star if i could .
it 's awful !
no antibiotics were prescribed .
i did not like the doctor .
he was very rude .
reading glasses are way off and hurt eyes .
distance are also not right .
however are still not right .
they obviously do n't follow a schedule ?
horrible !
there is normally a long wait .
this place is too big and too chaotic for me .
also need to update or clean the furniture in your waiting room .
i 'm giving _num_ stars since i 've never seen this doctor .
he needs to check his attitude .
that made it very inconvenient for other patients .
they said it is not something they could discuss with me over the phone .
are you kidding me ?
the displays were too cluttered and close together .
it 's bad business .
i agree they should charge the $ _num_ .
pick-up fee but if the furniture sells , it should be refunded .
i had to search all over the store myself .
a total ripoff .
the website says payment within _num_ days of selling .
not the last day of the month .
so , i have bought here before and the salesman lou was very accommodating .
not impressed what so ever !
the next coach was much like the first .
not in our experience .
would not recommend for beginners .
i signed my _num_ year old up for the beginner class .
we have not been back .
not for us !
i guess , chuck e cheese next time ?
i called and spoke with both owners , ken and jerry .
the pricing on food is fair and the wait time is reasonable .
not valid with any other offers .
since when is quarters not a legal tender in the united states ?
poorly managed .
second , most of the rides were closed .
she rounded down to _num_ tickets for each kid .
i took my kids here for a couple hours of fun .
i said is it the same price ?
what ever is left its ok .
daughter i were having the time of our lives tonight .
i was brad pitt and ginger was a young maggie q .
i should probably be at a casino instead of on yelp .
he probably recognized us from going there as much as we did .
but if you do go there , give craig the stink eye for us .
this place is n't fun for families .
not safe for children !
this place is the most overpriced smoke shop i have ever been in .
_num_ % better there .
extremely bad customer service .
horrible .
not to mention my nail broke already .
horrible just horrible .
my kid nephew could 've done a better job !
worst nail salon ever !
very rude staff .
horrible customer service .
so i just left this salon .
there at least a half dozen different chicken dishes , in all different styles .
my mom said the fish balls were n't too good .
the sushi are unremarkable .
i like the almond jello too .
sunset station is much better at picking up the finished plates promptly .
$ _num_ lunch includes hot tea , but not sodas .
get there early as there 's a wait once you hit 12:30 or so .
i 'm a vegetarian so there were n't many options for me .
furthermore , a couple of chocolate strawberries , fruit , and pastries .
it does n't look too clean .
so to sum things up ; it 's average .
call it a plain jane place if you want .
i should know better than to go to a buffet .
another chinese place that tries to do everything .
i do n't why everyone gives them all these stars .
horrible .
the alaska crab legs , and mongolian grill .
probably would n't go back .
ate at the location on eastern & flamingo yesterday ( sunday ) .
they only really had chinese , and some cheap pizza for the kids .
this place sucked !
horrible service !
i did not like eating here !
a friend talked me into going ... next time i pick the restaurant .
i cant believe the health department gave this place an a+ .
the floors were not clean .
as with any buffet , you get what you pay for .
so why only _num_ stars ?
they are there all the time now , even weekday lunches .
everything that i tried was very salty !
believe me go to panda express , go home and watch tv .
sure , there is a large variety of items to choose from .
$ _num_ for sunday buffet ?
btw , i ate at this restaurant two months ago .
never been a fan at buffet asia .
seriously .
the restaurant was 1/4 occupied .
that 's questionable .
are you stupid ?
ugh .
if you want some good chinese food head down the street to east ocean .
unfortunate .
horrible .
rude .
you 're better off going somewhere else .
food was disgusting !
there is soo many other buffets in las vegas !
horrible horrible horrible !
horrible !
worst buffet ever !
upon our return to the table there sat our drinks .
go to the buffet @ asia on flamingo and eastern ave , las vegas .
the price for dinner is $ _num_ you leave a tip after you dine .
but they do have a selection of asian desserts cakes and cookies etc .
they refilled our drinks and took old plates away quickly .
why my mom likes to go here , ill never understand .
the food here was simply ok .
the hot shrimp was probably my favorite thing .
the worst service ever .
food is okay but the staff really make this place suck !
food was mediocre .
bathrooms were nasty .
very rude .
wo n't come back .
gross !
so no variety there .
i am staying away from chinese buffets from now on !
no stars !
horrible !
just horrible .
it 's not bad .
the floor is covered in fifth , because apparently the staff does nothing here .
if that was chocolate , i 'm never eating it again .
_num_ % do not come here !
this place was bad .
the food was not good .

worst restaurant ever .
_num_ $ + _num_ $ of the grilled food .
not worth it .
the bathroom are disgusting .
i will not be returning .
terrible service .
overall horrible experience !
Negative
i think nothing special .
honestly , i 'd trust walmart sushi over this .
not a lot of selection either .
the mongolian grill is gone .
i noticed something felt greasy under my plate and turned it over .
goes to another stack and does the same thing .
barely felt anything .
this place is disgusting !
if you are looking for quantity , this is the place to go .
really bad .
it was horrible .
but , if you want to try somewhere new , please be careful .
pieces of acrylic all over my fingers & chunks under my nails .
so irritating !
very disappointed .
it was terrible .
i would not recommend .
they did n't care .
find someone else to utilize .
Neutral
previously they accepted credit cards and checks now they only accept cash .
they had my dog from 8am in the morning til 4pm at night .
you want a cheap groom you can definitely get it here .
what a huge mistake .
i was asking for an additional _num_ off their current price ... .
i brought my dog there around 11am on a saturday .
is there a problem ?
so he makes one of his employees go get my dog .
i am trying to be nice and he thinks i am being mean ?
thank god i didnt leave her with a fruit cake like you !
they only take cash it 's a must .
very disappointed and dissatisfied !
as in sour .
they were hot and loaded .
it 's crap .
terrible bar .
i am shocked they have stayed open for this long .
we got two pizzas correct and the other came as a hawaiian pizza .
the pizza was not good .
i did like the cheese bread , though .
would not recommend to anyone .
horrible service .

this place is just like a hospital cafeteria .
not very many selections .
where to start ?
this place is terrible !
me and my boyfriend came in on _num_ tuesday .
bad choice .
there are some good sides like baked potatoes and breadsticks .
more like crappy salads !
went here to buy some foundation because it 's closer than a sephora store .
the gal was rude .
i should stop coming here , but i 'm crazy .
ridiculous .
very poor customer service .
one associate alone came up to us _num_ times .
it was that bad .
okay so ulta salon is equivalent to a super cuts .
there is also nothing more convenient than the internet .
ulta needs to put their employees in check .
i have to go get my haircut again .
terrible , terrible customer service .
never enough cashiers for the line of people trying to purchase products .
i scheduled an appointment for the following month ... this morning .
want to recommend me to a great makeup foundation or whatever ?
so i made an appointment with her and made my way back in .
it was so awkward .
basically a `` get your product and leave '' attitude .
ugh .
Positive
Positive
my hair was down the middle of the my back .
i am a makeup junkie and frequent ulta and sephora .
it 's a little pricey but competitive vs other specialty stores .
it was reasonably busy but most sales associates were wandering around .
i got my lip waxed and literally part of my lip was taken off .
horrible !
i have n't been to a lot of robertos .
no soap in bathroom .
no napkins on tables .

( _num_ ) geek squad is not as knowledgable as they say they are .
once it took almost a month to get my computer back !
best to buy somewhere else !
i was there to grab a laptop , i knew what i wanted .
it was a simple walk in , purchase and leave .
nothing crazy , an easy sell for the staff .
no help at all .
um no thanks !
and i 'm good on cable providers , too .
terrible store and worse management .
i live nowhere near a best buy and that was a long drive .
i been treated like dirt .
this is regarding my black friday experience .
horrible customer service .
just short answers and `` it 's over there '' type of responses .
completely ridiculous .
am i not trusted ?
is your cashier not trusted ? ''
do you know how generic of a line that is ?
Positive
horrible service .
my phone battery died before i got anyone to answer !
i walked in when the store opened .
she says to just wait for the email .
next time i am going to order my pics from snap fish .
i stuck it out .
no way !
incompetent .
if you do n't handle animals , they never get used to it .
not complaining , i decided to buy another at that cheap of a price .
)
place is depressing .
`` well , i really recommend buying a heating pad . ''
i said no thanks .
also , much of their merchandise is covered in dust .
the one i chose appeared healthy and young ( size of a quarter ) .
she was dead .
Negative
jim was helpful , professional , and courteous .
the cut was horrible .
they shaved her butt hole that it was bare there .

it was before _num_ .
i was pissed .
they filled my balloons immediately and apologized .
nothing but shoes were tried on !
$ _num_ in tux rentals and we have to ask to have them steamed !
professionalism and service should be a priority , especially now days .
i would n't recommend them .
i was just in the store with my fianc looking for shoes and accessories .
i went with my husband to this location to get ready for our wedding .
see this is a issue now all the men will have the same uniform .
im so angry .
i checked out the closest old navy and this was it .
( even in las vegas .
it is almost impossible to find your size .
they did have _num_ % off which was nice .
no coupon necessary .
not sure how long that will last .
sale signs are n't clear .
the sweet cashier called an employee she was having check on the sale cards .
she just told the cashier not to honor the sale price .
i 've experienced _num_ star service for half the price .
did n't even say hello back .
bad for business .
you 've been warned !
the entrees here are simply too sweet to be authentic .
fast forward we continued dinner at home with a bottle merlot to boot .
poorly executed dish .
i have a huge problem with paying more for way less food .
not impressed .
this place has been busy whenever i 've been .
the curries are disappointing .
)
as a vegetarian i would rate this pretty low .
i wish that were an exaggeration .
so incredibly disappointed .
wasted $ _num_ !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
taste was bland .
pad thai was horrible .
wo n't be returning .
catfish green curry was pretty good , but a little salty .
ridiculous waiting time .

felt rushed !
overly hyped .
small portions for high prices .
service was lacking .
food is n't all that great .
i ordered the vegetable panang curry and chicken mint noodles .
i was really unimpressed .
i ordered chicken pad thai at a _num_ , my usual order .
it was disgusting .
it tastes watered down .
visiting from california and craving thai food .
disappointing .
never going back !
only a few customer there .
what do they just attempt to heat your food .
i would n't recommend it .
it was not a _num_ !
not the best in town , in my book .
my husband and i went there to eat last night .
i 'm still suffering from the food .
also , it just seems silly to skimp on rice .
small portions with super expensive prices .
like i said , any other place is better than here .
the portions get smaller and smaller as the prices go up .
greedy business owners ... .
crappy service .
absolute horrible service .
the food was horrific .
the staff is inconsistent .
no water refills .
the menu is all over the place , i never know what to order .
but , they do usually have deals such as _num_ $ for two .
so you order _num_ entrees that comes with an appetizer for _num_ $ .
it 's basically loaded fries ( cheese , jalapeos , and bacon ) .
there were empty tables .
we should not have eaten here .
ugh .
anyway , we split a bacon avocado chicken sandwich for lunch .
ugh .
first off we have not been to a chili 's in about five years .
we got our appetizer , then _num_ seconds later our food .
a friend and i visited this location after a long work night .
soon the session breaks up and out comes the food !
it was bad .
it was really bad .
i could n't eat it .
we walked in and went straight to the booths located in the bar area .
place is freezing cold .
maybe you should possibly consider getting some candles for birthdays !
poor form .
they were also very thin .
the mcdonalds next door would probably satisfy your needs better than this place .
my dad ordered a full rack of baby back ribs .
my mom ordered the fillet medallions with bleu cheese and wild mushroom topping .

excuse me ?
they just want their money .
i would seriously consider another jewelry store before coming here to customize anything !
not even a hello .
my fianc is not with me and i 'm not purchasing anything without him .
i understand that your employees may make some commission off of what they sell .
but your profit is n't made off one time buyers .
it 's made off of returning customers .
do n't fall for it .
after posting the original review i was contacted by a supervisor .
i said yes i have a very low left rear tire .
i bought tires in june , after getting them put on .
i had another tire not tight , this time you could feel it driving .

it just takes too long though .
as usual told me what else needs done to car but otherwise almost done .
that was _num_ mins ago .
as he stated it did fall off .

my brother and his girlfriend recently had their baby shower .
wish they would hire smiling cashiers to make my visits more pleasant .
_num_ hours came and went and guess what ?
no call .
i immediately called customer service and spoke with sara .
this location seems to always be low in stock of most things .
well as long as the wife does n't force me .
if something like that happened in my store you should check on them immediately !
worst applebee 's ever !
terrible service !
every restaurant , regardless of city and state seems to have issues .
never going back .
they replaced the hot chips with at least warm chips .
i ordered the _num_ for twenty .
ive never seen anyone pick up something with their bare hands .
this is pathetic .
i have had fresher , better tasting foods at fast food joints .
why _num_ stars ?
worst service ever .
that would be our waitress kelly f .
never going back .
it was n't even busy .
i had thee bahama mama rum mixed drink with my meal .

the worst food ever .
whatever .
this has been a staple on there menu forever and a day .
nothing against this restaurant .
the hash browns listed as `` crispy '' were far from it .
we will not be using them ever again .

hot , golden brown , crispy crust , dripping with cheese and toppings .
not my freaking fault !
it seems like they checked out .
me and my families first time was last saturday , about _num_ pm .
the wait was very long .
although you do have free entertainment that 's for sure .
every time i am craving for a slush on a hot sunny day .
terrible customer service .
customer value is not a concern of his it 's apparent .
because of _num_ dollars .
it 's not the bank .
i guess u ca n't expect much from a local mom and pops shack .
they seem to have more wigs than anything .
big mistake .
the location of this store is in a very scary plaza .
everybody else just walked by .
irritating .
might as well go down the street to sally 's .
first call sent to voicemail even though during business hours .
the service is lacking .
fail .
it will be a long while before i come here again .
it is overall fairly similar to olive garden in food and dcor .
terrible rude lazy staff .
worst service ever .
it was n't a satisfactory experience .
wish they could get it right .
the manager made lame excuses .
ick !
it was soo gross !
by then everyone was done .
my husband and i went to this particular location after church .
the worst was mine .
the experience was not good .
total tables where _num_ .
food was n't the best .

so , very disappointed !
big mistake .
will not be returning !
she had fettuccine alfredo with chicken , also average .
i literally seat there for _num_ with nobody even asking for drinks .
i just left .
horrible horrible service !
the place was empty .
ok , inconvenient , but it was only 10-15 min .
macaroni grill is n't anything special just an italian chain restaurant .
sounds nice but i 'm sure it 's because the location is hurting .
i could see the other waitresses and waiters being friendly to customers as well .
the chicken parm was ok .
there was n't enough sauce .
the roasted potatoes were pleasant , a little salty for my personal tastes .
it was so disappointing .
a tomato creamy and a tomato basil garlic .
both were not good .
disappointing .
not many vegetarian choices .
my first and probably last time here .
table bread was overwhelmed with rosemary .
none of that .
tried the blackened chicken and fettuccine alfredo .
the chicken was good , and the fettuccine needed more seasoning .
completely abandoned without even a word .
not worth the time or money .
foul .
walks away and under his breath says `` christ .
the portobello fries were alright ... not something i would order again .
what a disappointing experience .
well , the drinks are cheap .
do not eat here .
ugh .
not even for a drink .
that was a mistake .

just awful .
i dont understand how they any customers .

i looked out the window and immediately saw _num_ flies on the inside folks .
i ordered the potato soup , meatball sliders and double cream lemon pie .
you get two , i sent one home .
yet they would n't do anything about it .
i hate pecan pie .
later on our waitress comes back and ask are we ready to order yet .
so we placed our order and was nothing difficult or special .
as was our waiter , who dealt with all my complaining .
better service equals bigger tip .
the place is disgusting .
the restaurant was small and there were plenty of tables available .
have n't been to this location in probably ten years or so .
fries were very plain .
my ordered was served minus utensils or napkins .
went for lunch with my husband .
the bread was soggy .
seriously people its not real hard to do your job , give a little .
i ca n't stand walmart .
i hate this walmart .
could n't find it .
still no luck .
dry , unfriendly , sarcastic .
just not this one .
horrible , horrible , horrible !
no sale .
this walmart is not your typical walmart .
but , therefore this is the most ghetto walmart in las vegas ever !
not safe at all .
total shopping hell .
who can make a living only being open from _num_ a.m. to _num_ p.m .
is n't this vegas ?
_num_ p.m. ?
guess it 's good for breakfast and lunch , but not for dinner .
)
very sad .
the food was gross .
the sausage was the cheap round ones cut into pieces .
extremely disappointed .
Positive
not the best way to get new customers .
it makes me wonder where else bugs are hanging out in this place .
here are the pluses : the wait to get a table was quick .
the wait staff were courteous and attentive .
Negative

but i just could n't .
i can not wait to get home to take these off !
it is annoying .
they really need to work on customer service and cleanliness .
chit chatting about personal business is not something u do at the front desk .
horrible horrible .
out of em all , i am partial to papa john 's .
the second pizza was even free courtesy of the manager because of it .

no call , no email .
that was a mistake .
it was wrong .
absolute rip off .
i genuinely hate this place .
remember that oil check i mentioned above ?
hi , rude !
is not worth the money .
never visited an olive garden before .
i sat down and was given menus .
i got the salad , wife got soup .
the marinara sauce had an off smell and taste to it .
what crap !
barley a _num_ star .
so disappointed .
horrible customer service !
worst meal ever !
sat next to a table of kids with babies who yelled and screamed .
service needs improvement big time .
the fried mozzarella was good but we only got three .
i do have to say that they were very accommodating with my vegan diet .
hesitant in bringing more salad ... .
want to be treated like a low life instead of a valued customer ?
i was followed around to the point of getting bumped into .
lost a customer .
comes with vegetables and a drink for around _num_ bucks and change .
overall , i wasnt too impressed .
the next time im in the area i might give these guys another try .

this place is giving us too much hassle .
does n't even deserve _num_ star .
products never labeled correctly .
never enough cashiers or employees at customer service desk .
only come here in the morning and get out quick .
because it becomes a war zone here very quickly .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
nothing but ghetto employees .

call another cashier to open , if u have another one !
go tell ur manager to hire more cashiers !

never do they have enough registers open .
worst walmart ever !
the gentleman that checked us out was matter of fact with minimal conversation .

i simple asked for the pickles they forgot .
long wait at the drive thru .
horrible place .

my husband was always left with an expensive bill , every time .
no , thanks !
the place looks run down .
she is a tall thin lady .
the second time not so good i went on 4th .

maybe this is why they have different name from before .
i went in to try the chicken fried steak which i was hungry for .
she had never heard of texas toast so i ordered the sour dough toast .
our regular server was not here .

all and all , for $ _num_ you get a lot for your money .
so disappointed .
instead they did a one tooth exam and one x-ray .
the second kmart i went to today .
you ca n't find anything that you are looking for .
this location like most others was very busy .
it seems like they 're never stocked up on items either .
even when my dog got loose and ran away .
no where .
well she had a chip so , the chip stated i am her owner .
poor service !
rude disrespectful staff !
horrible .
but then they sent us to collections saying we still owed .
also , make you wait for ever to clock in .
waited for over two hours to get my car back .
i have been to this car wash many times over the years .

such a frustrating experience !
p.s .

this time the guy who answered apparently had trouble finding our reservation .
hell no .
on top of that , the wait is very long .
i can see why this location was rated so low .
right off , the first caution sign is the large menu .
then there 's the chicken , the most accessible of the bunch .
it looked more like kitchen sink soup since it had everything else in it .
skip this place .
of course it 's your typical standard `` chinese fare '' .
and chicken in garlic sauce with fried rice .
Negative
not worth it .
i understand certain noodles get gravy type of sauce depending on the noodle .
she was telling me spicy but nothing spicy about it .
everything was pretty bland .
the potstickers were cold .

so annoyed .
urgent care not so urgent !
it really costs $ _num_ ! ''
peter d from san jose .

yet , a year later , i am wishing that another company was used .
monday came and went and nothing .
i once again wait for another week .
no thanks .
bye bye sierra a/c !
the existing ac unit died and i was getting multiple estimates .

( like i thought they were doing ... not ! )
i lose mi money .
there are only about _num_ cars in the parking lot .
it does n't represent their brand at all .

so they were all lying to me completely .
i was ready to leave , my fianc finally signed me out .
terrible doctors , nurses .
fuck this place _num_ % .

the doctors and nurses were friendly but the wait was excessive .
i 'd definitely try another hospital next time before coming here .
beyond tired of waiting .
_num_ hours and counting .
worst hospital experience ever .
over a _num_ hour wait .
if you truly have an emergency i suggest going to a different hospital .
clearly they just wanted to make money .
be smart !
this is a money making place .
not even that busy .
worst hospital ever .
nothing but lip service .
i 'd prefer not to give this review any stars .
worst er ever !
there was no privacy .
i have no peace whatsoever !
dear ed charge nurse sarah .
very unprofessional and gross !
all the while he is jumping around like a mad man in extreme pain .

nasty .
service was awful too .
rather disappointing .
first , do n't ask me how i want the burger done .
coleslaw was bad .

poor service and overcooked bland food .
below average bbq .
these people really need to step up their bbq game .
meat quality was fatty .

i drove by the drive through right before 9pm last night .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
we ordered the catfish , baked potato , macaroni and muffins .
the potato was , well , just a potato .
umm ... _num_ minutes ?

terrible company .
most pt 's get _num_ stars .

this place is terribly unprofessional .
they really could care less .
this place is a total joke .
this place is an absolute joke .
very disappointed !
i guess everything in las vegas is a gamble .
i could have rented a car and saved even more .
i opted to upgrade my tour to include the pink jeep private tour .
so much wasted time !
the first stop was at the hoover dam .
in my opinion , another unnecessary stop !
after that it was straight to las vegas .
the staff did greet us as we walked around .
my bad .
and that , my friends , is not in the fine print .
so you want contact lenses ?
she said that that was my only choice .
very rude .
the owner could ship out contact lenses to his customers .
not leaving happy or with glasses for my daughter .
service with exam was lengthy at over an hour .
just an ugly place .
not worth it .
linda was very demanding and loud .
we always hit up the snack bar for the outrageously cheap and tasty food .
will not return to this location .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
i guess keeping customers is n't necessarily a priority here .
the food was horrible .
but she gave us the menu , and it was insanely overpriced .
i ordered a new york style thin crust pizza with pepperoni .
_num_ months later someone from the office called to say the extensions were in .

incredibly bad !
sales promises not followed though .
no service .
no management inspection until demanded .
horrible horrible work !
almost nothing in the store .
just a dusty little place with a couple hats and shirts .
make it fun exciting that kind of thing .
being as i 'm in las vegas .
ridiculous .
i 've been with this doctor for the last _num_ years .
so beware !
the next appointment he sent me finally to get an x-ray .
they could get me in thirty _num_ days later .
absolutely horrible practice !
i will not be back .
called monday about 9am , ask for emergency service .
i ordered the beef hash stuffed omelette and my wife ordered salami and eggs .
i 've had better breakfasts and better service from mcdonald 's .
they gave me chewy bacon when i asked for extra crispy .
and more and more .
i guess fate drove me here .
the service was terrible .
when she finally did , i ordered a coffee and the apple pancake .
finally , i 'm ready to eat .
my oldest son requires gluten-free food .
normally , for breakfast , this is never an issue .
because potatoes are so much more expensive than pancakes ?
ridiculous !
it was not .
breakfast for me , and for _num_ little boys , totaled $ _num_ .
the syrup was so thin it was like pouring water .
it too was runny .
i have frequented oph for over _num_ years .
the sausage was cold .
well the syrup is the cheapest tasting syrup substitute i 've ever had .
nothing to get excited about .
they were busy but not crazy like i remember the charleston location being .
ummmm , come again ?

bacon , eggs , potatoes and side of pancakes ... .
bad bad bad service !
never buying a groupon for this location again .
a little too doughy .

we walked in with a party of _num_ right in front of us .
_num_ minutes !
such a rip off !
i was very disappointed .
the sausage was ok .
my husband substituted sourdough pancakes in place of the buttermilk pancakes .
this morning i came in to order their awesome eggs michael .
we ate here this morning .
my pancakes were half raw , eggs overdone .
waitress rarely checks up , had to constantly flag her down .
this is a reminder of why we should check reviews first lol .
quite disappointed , again .
nobody asks if you want more ; they just bring the check .
you could do much better .
on top of that , it takes the server forever just to bring beverages .
the syrup with the pancake runs like water pouring out .
i 'd feel much more satisfied cooking at home .
food is ok , pancakes are moist which us a plus .
food was great and the server was in a serious hurry .
end of breakfast rush maybe but not service oriented !
will not come back .
i ordered banana crepe , german pancakes and egg benedict !
the only i ate was german pan cakes !
otherwise you will lose your customers slowly but surely !
after more waiting , a group of _num_ entered the eating area .
they were immediately seated , given menus , and had their drink orders taken .
i could walk there and back in that amount of time .
the driver did n't care .
the store did n't care .
worst customer service !

i wish this was a friendlier place .
no caramelized meat here .
very disappointing .
this was my first choice to satisfy my sudden gyro craving .
we park and immediately smell the deliciousness of kabob grill in the air .
the restaurant was busy , which is usually an excellent sign .
yay , gyro craving is about to be satisfied !
i do not recommend .
just bad customer service .
it was way too pricey .
not everyone wants to stuff themselves .
slow , slow , slow !
frozen uncooked garbage !

also they forgot to give me the remote control for the stereo .
horrible experience .
i stopped in to have a new deck put into my wife 's car .

disgusting .

my husband tried cheese enchiladas with _num_ different salsa and thought it was good .
not going back .
bland !
no flavor in anything .
also as a note , they dont serve menudo .
we went late , so maybe the chef was having an off night .
i asked server for best burrito they have .
person who was with me said the shrimp tacos were great .
the only tasty thing on my plate was rice .
no good mixed drink !
on that note , i walked in and we went straight for the bar .
bad idea .
i ordered both flour and corn tortillas and i only got corn .
my husbands burrito consisted of big chunks of beef ... and i mean chunks .
do n't take the chance .
worst mexican place ever !
the bartender was rude !
very disappointed .
it 's very confusing .
we looked up progressive and found only stellar reviews .
with dogs and kids , we thought this was a bit urgent .
my home office window looks out to the street .

at the end of this year i am leaving to go to law school .
a minute later she called me back on my cell phone .
he needs to be taught some customer service skills .
will you guys be giving me issues now to get another box ?
it took them a week to get back to me .

hmmm makes no sense .

then you check out and they print out pages of receipts .
get over it kmart .
this was not the greatest .
then the guy comes back like nothing happened !
if i could give these a _num_ i would .
after she hands me my food she quickly turns around and walks away .
horrible customer service !

it was sliced deli meat with some kind of thick white sauce .
god awful .
wear a blind fold and a gas mask .
do n't let the cheap food signs outside fool you .
this was just a cheap room , got what i paid for .
terrible service .
this location stinks .
service is ridiculous .
girl behind the counter kept asking about the tattoos my husband and i have .
rather unprofessional and pretty rude .
no , no , no , no no !
greens are terrible .
most of the holes were well laid out .
most of the holes were pretty wide open off the tee .
frustrating !
very poor first impression !
i was very underwhelmed by the `` asian '' salad .
chopped iceberg , crunchy things , smoke flavored chicken and asian dressing .
_num_ .
nobody is answering the phone .
terrible customer service .
lots of americans are in mixed culture families .
i 've never left food on the plate like this before .
i ordered _num_ and left _num_ .
they even cut down your trees without replacement if you `` make trouble '' .
they pee on the wall and smoke drugs right outside my back patio .
i regret buying here !
w. t. effing f !
the gas industry is evil .
not a super fan .
disgusting and overpriced .
my stomach is still in pain as i write this review !
almost _num_ min had gone by , and nothing !
we were seated on time and the restaurant was only 1/3 full .
_num_ of us ordered steak dinners and _num_ ordered the holiday turkey dinner .
the turkey dinners were good .
it took a long time to get our meals .
just sorry .
i ' d expect more from management .
it 's not available until 8pm .
forget about it !
waitress from hell !
everyone was ready to order there , selected item on the menu .
this was my 1st time here , and it was for my birthday .
i 've never ate here before ?
i went up to a different waiter , and asked for a manager .
it was taking forever for our check to come .
terrible .
our table is one of only a few occupied tables in our dining area .
horrible smelling , horrible tasting .
but , wait , what is this ?
the server then proceeds to open the bottle and pour full glasses !
the specials are nothing special .
the tequila shrimp appetizer is served on a sauce of ketchup .
get a chef , really !
does anyone care there any longer ?
having gone here for ages you can tell things have changed cook wise .
it takes someone that eats scallops to cook them right i think .
crab stack has more mayonnaise and seasoning to cover any hint of crab flavor .
too bad .
i will not be back .
you sold your $ _num_ filet tonight , which is what my so ordered .
probably not .
i ordered the oysters to begin with .
the dish was pitiful .
we each ordered prime rib , with salad and baked potatoes .
starting with the spinach salad having slimy leaves , not wilted from the dressing .
wilted is one thing , slimy leaves after date is another .
somewhat disappointed .
wife and i ate here for the first time on new year 's eve .
i 'm mark and i 'll be your server this evening . ''
who runs out of bottles of champagne on new year 's eve ?
at that price point , better server training and management is needed .
very disappointing .
the guy kept grabbing my purse and the chair closer to him .
so i pulled it back since this made me very very nervous .
so he slides a drink in front of it .
what an awful place .
salsa tasted canned .
$ _num_ for a $ _num_ drink .
for an appetizer we had the potato skins .
no tang or booze .
ordered a cheese crispy , expecting sizzling hot cheese and , well , crispy .
if you 've ordered , you 'll never see the waiter again .
the prices where to high for a mexican restaurant in las vegas .
the service was terrible .
for dinner , i selected the green burrito .
most versions of this dish have onions , peppers , and spices infused throughout .
overpriced for mediocre food !
i was a little fooled by a review that mentioned `` outdoor '' seating .
so i walk in and head for the bar .
i kept wishing there was flavor .
none to be had .
place was just sad .
food- was horrible .
my fiance ordered a shrimp burrito .
like rotten fish .
not only that but it was full of `` scallops '' .
_num_ years ago , the food , staff and service were amazing .
she was wearing a shirt that indicated she works at the buffet .
either they are short handed or she was `` too busy '' to change .
servers do n't listen when you order .
you 'll get more bang for your $ $ .
the tip was as non-existent as the waitress .
this place just sucked .
but the most questionable item was the tortilla chips .
skip this place .
luckily my wife stepped away to watch laser show .
service is horrible .
was immediately seated and served drinks .
like flavorless cardboard .
service was also poor .
the patio however was nice .
super slow !
tonight was the worst !
i had the bacon , eggs , hash browns and toast .
three of us went in for breakfast .
_num_ minutes !
very slow service here ?
had to have the manager chase down the waitress to get my check .
they were noticeably understaffed .
ugh .
after digging through the first layer , i found another layer of lettuce .
pretty typical dennys .
by now , you 're probably thinking , what about the stall next over ?
there also was n't any paper towels .
finally our food comes , cold mind you .
three other customers after me got their meal before i did .
i 'm glad that i dont have stock in this company .
it 's not hard to read the screen on an order .
with hardly anyone around .
worst customer service ever .
never book with cruise america .
now it 's impossible to get a hold of them to resolve my case .
avoid at all costs .
i rented the rv for a long weekend trip with some friends .
, and lukewarm .
at $ _num_ , they 're charging about $ _num_ too much .
if you 're staying there and want a basic breakfast , this is it .
this past experience , however , is worth two .
not a great variety of food .
the main ethnic food here is mexican followed by chinese .
the hot meats available were baked ham and roast beef .
desserts are the generic cakes .
service was slow .
i had to get beverage refills constantly myself .
do n't bother .
mediocre at best .
the asian stir fry vegetables were decent .
for a buffet , she provided everything i would want out of our server .
the server alone bumped this up to _num_ stars .
i would split the _num_ & give this _num_ 1/2 stars .
buffet .
the food was terrible .
this buffet was so confusing .
horrible breakfast service .
terrible service .
i think she sure deserve the golden globe for that one .
she was so hesitant to call for management .
the lady mgr was very courteous and apologetic .
was i wrong again !
people there were rude .
canned fruit .
they have a land and sea buffet on friday and saturday night .
no thank you .
what a supreme disappointment .
ridiculous !
i 'm completely avoiding this place .
so , we went again on sunday night .
nothing we ate even came close to average .
prime rib and turkey were both moist and tender .
not very many vegetable options .
salad portion was okay .
i was unimpressed and disappointed .
my daughter loves crab leg night so we go .
station casino have a definite leg up on sam 's .
very disappointing !
little caesars needs to get it 's stuff together .
little caesars does n't fall into that category .
nothing wrong with it .
there .
what a terrible experience !
just so happened that a friend convinced me to try discount firearms .
this is exactly how you lose business to someone else .
poorly managed .
i run my business out of my rv .
never use them .
no one there .
it was weird .
i went out to find someone to have them turn on the lights .
just awful .
rude management .
it 's useless .
staff fail !
this theater is horrible .
nasty .
c'mon , sam town - get it together .
just returned from seeing `` the _num_ '' with my wife .
we were extremely insulted .
they used lotion that smelt like motor oil to me for the message portion .
i will not be going back .
horrible place .
the first time i went it was very busy .
poor poor service .
so the guy leaves .
and i am like well , maybe we will get in sooner .
i would n't really go here .
when their tech returned , i made an appointment for 9am the next day .
no bueno !
and that 's just to come out - not to do anything !
pity .
ugh never again .
horrible experience !
was not helpful what so ever , and will never return !
making the appointment was painless .
i like most people i meet and get along with almost everyone .
not so much .
he was a total jerk about it .
do n't go near this place .
i was in las vegas for the holidays and needed a fill .
excuse me ?
horrible service !
_num_ lanes open .
_num_ people waiting in each .
price : wow , i remember when it was actually cheap to eat here .
the worst rude !
our visit was thursday the 4th of december _num_ .
are you kidding me ?
thoroughly disappointed .
completely awful .
not freshly cooked at all .
old and dry .
the food looked and tasted very old .
i 'm shaking my head .
it stayed on for another month before coming off again .
no frills .
for $ _num_ you can definitely find a better barber in vegas .
all three of my children went to st elizabeth for many years .
would not recommend it to anyone .
$ _num_ for a large pizza ?
so far , i would highly recommend checking this place out .
bad service .
only reason for one star is yelp !
stopped coming in everyday .
ugh .
it was a mistake .
this place use to be so much better than this .
-i went here with some friends for a late lunch on a saturday .
it was just iceberg .
came in tonight just to have a bottle of wine .
in the last few years , this place has really jumped the shark .
did n't eat here and never will .
it felt immediately uncomfortable .
total that i spent here ?
_num_ dollars .
the bread pudding dessert was okay .
my wife and i went here after getting a groupon for dinner .
service was mediocre .
frankly we 've made better penne ala vodka at home .
i am a long time patron of grape street .
we sat and got water and bread fairly quickly and ordered the fried calamari .
my girlfriend got the blackened salmon caesar salad .
this is my last trip to grape street .
is not common practice for a party of _num_ for dinner .
comparing apples to apples , grape street is above average .
the chilean sea bass and the jumbo ravioli were great dinner choices .
not so sure about that now .
however he just gave us the bill and we had to figure it out .
not exceptionally friendly .
paper menus were pretty tacky as well .
felt rushed the entire time .
never asked , just took the plate away .
ahi tuna , i might add .
so we will be back , wanting to support the place .
i was visiting some friends in las vegas .
our waitress mentioned red sauce was more popular .
my husband ordered the same thing as me .
kind of disappointing ... .
our patronage was obviously inconvenient .
there was never a greeting , telling us his name .
terrible !
they also gave us difficulty with a groupon .
come on it was like _num_ bucks !
definately would not be returning ever !
it was very bizarre .
i dunno .
slow service .
poor presentation of food .
wont be going back .
disgusting !
ordered bread pudding and our ice cream came out with freezer burn !
this place was terrible !
disappointing .
this place sucked .
gross .
my wife ordered crab stuffed shrimp and the house chopped salad .
my italian sandwich was a little thin on the cold cuts .
frankly i 've had a better italian cold cut sandwich at capriotti 's .
it was disappointing .
olive garden would be an improvement ... .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
we told our server we would be ordering food as well .
our waters were never refilled .
disappointed .
would n't recommend .
the place was also extremely extremely loud .
not a value , even with groupon .
it seems prices have been adjusted up to cover heavy coupon use .
the service was not .
hated it !
never experienced that ever over the past _num_ years of getting my nails done .
$ _num_ he said .
the worst experience ever !
she was horrific !
do not come here .
she gave me two rings of gel color .
this situation happened _num_ times .
the owner usually takes down the appointments .
_num_ it was an emergency because my nails broke .
_num_ .
director is rude .
teachers do n't care .
beware !
ridiculous .
shame on me !
waste of time .
do n't recommend ... .
she mentioned that she usually does hair but does n't mind doing nails .
never going back .
the gel was all over the place .
they looked bad !
worst service ever !
he never once apologized .
the cashier took an order and then went to prepare the food .
they are completely unfair !
every time i come to this starbucks they burn my shot .
i had the typical battery of tests at my second visit .
after all the money we 've spent there .
Neutral
nothing in writing ?
that just seems very suspicious .
Neutral
are you kidding me ?
will not be back .
horrible experience !
i will not be returning .
do n't eat here .
nothing special .
it looked more like a dough lovers pizza .
the turkey melt was so so .
just a disappointment .
needless to say , it was pretty busy , but not packed .
my friend and i come in on sunday night around 10pm .
to my surprise the groupon is not accepted at night .
and says she 's off and would like us to close .
no luck .
like many previous clients have stated ... one breast was larger than the other .
horrible plastic surgeon .
noticeably different in size .
very difficult .
worst insurance company ever !
terrible .
waste of time .
Negative
paid my first premium , $ _num_ in february .
co. '' and can not find it in their records .
worst customer care .
just got my monthly bill from sierra .
that ai n't happening here at the `` summerlin '' location .
this location is not in summerlin .
i returned some frozen veggies recently to this location .
i left the veggies and walked away .
this is the second time i 've had to return food to them .
i went into the office yesterday , the office staff was very friendly .
i 'm worried sick .
i pointed out a few more , not just the _num_ he focused on .
on another note , normally my office visits are $ _num_ .
incredibly disappointed .
i was a bit put off .
it makes me wonder if all the staff and medical staff are like this .
keep in mind this was my first visit .

i feel embarrassed and sad .
that 's not good .
prior to my appointment i had blood work done .

the wait of course was long , both times .
be very careful of this company .
no care , no service .
so ridiculous .
rude !
wrong !
false advertising .
flat out .
their gear is as dated as the decor .
it 's obviously too much trouble for them to consider .
ridiculous !
the tables were n't cleaned off to the very end .
first off , it 's a saturday night .
just walked away !
salad bar was disgusting .
total rip off .
but after tonight this will be the last !
after paying for the buffet we noticed the salad was wilted with brown edges .
it was a little bit , but it made the sandwich smell like tuna .
it was also soaking with oil and vinegar .
we were very disappointed .
ugh .
was just oil n vinegar .
pass .
waited almost _num_ mins for them .
note to self : never used them again .
just awful .
the worst service ever !
are you freaking kidding me ?

the waiting room has dining chairs as their waiting seats .
horrible horrible experience .
cleanliness is not a priority ... .
however , something happened where they stopped cleaning things regularly apparently .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
her attitude sucks !
i dunno , something about this place is just so ... sterile .
i do n't like it .
do n't normally add reviews but just wanted everyone to know our experience .
our washer broke so i needed to purchase a new one .
but it was not .
everytime i go there the people there just look mad all day .
receipt tape and _num_ .
but not quite .
poor selection .
not entirely surprising .
not enough cashiers it seems .
very pathetic indeed .
very rude cashier workers .
god this place sucks .
they usually just open _num_ register at 8pm and the lines are ridiculously long .
those cash registers are probably older than me !
another _num_ minutes .
there is just never anyone at the electronics .
yes , i wait every single time .
then turned and walked away .
what an horrible experience .
then i get a letter _num_ week later saying my results are normal .
my rating goes down every time i come here .
he apologized at the follow up appointment .
i was upset after i explained i 've had numerous problems with the office .
they then proceed to start telling me available times in february .
ridiculous and so rude .
_num_ .
we 're all just cattle , not patients .
_num_ .
wait time is forever .
i get it , sometimes you have to wait awhile to see the doctor .
_num_ .
it is a very busy office , probably too busy .
i have accidentally been billed twice for the same thing .
then i get a letter _num_ week later saying my results are normal .
but lots of doctors have busy practices yet they have adequate competent staffing .
it 's just not worth it .
still waiting for my money back .
not mention the scorpions i have seen around the property .
it 's horrible .
this place sucks .

had surgery here and survived , so , that 's a thing .
thanks for nothing .
i had seen this hospital several times in passing , as i live nearby .
unacceptable !
it was just horrible .
i refused .
_num_ ) you get to check yourself in via computer .
remind me to drive right past this place if i 'm ever dying !
aka my bf .
the person who took my information was polite and helpful .
not acceptable !
totally unethical practice for any business let alone a hospital .
but they sure as heck are n't getting extra stars for that .
Neutral
i could n't even walk .
it was even hot to the touch .
that day i researched my symptoms online .
centennial hills .
horrible horrible hospital !
from _num_ stars to _num_ ?
the emergency staff was very professional and prompt .
what a horrible experience .
worst hospital ever .

very unhappy about this .
nothing for pain !
i feel i was miss treated and under diagnosed .
Neutral

on november _num_ my grandmother fell ill and we visited mountain view .
he sent her to a bed and had nurses care for her .
i have been a patient here for scheduled services and that has been ok .
rude staff .
they dont even deserve one star !
horrible .
none worked .
the worst !
worse er ever !
doctor basically called me a crazy person instead of helping me with chest pain .
apparently the term `` shortly '' means `` around 2-3 hours '' to her .
she asked a nearby blonde nurse where the er lobby was .
i wish this hospital would care more about their patients .
couldnt find a staff member to help me find where to go .
pathetic excuse for a hospital !
the employees have always been very helpful when i really needed it .
anyway , very rude .
my bad .
it does n't include print and cut .
absolutely nothing made sense .
this place is horrible .
i spent a few hundred dollars for her treatment .
bland and boring .
we ordered sausage , mushroom , and black olives and onions .
i ordered _num_ calzones .
will not order from there again .
our favorite pizza of choice is the buffalo chicken pizza .
sorry , beach pizza .
for the prices , not a real good value .
i ordered the two pizzas , paid , and said i 'd be back .
not to trustworthy and i wish they would respond to this posting .
the food was really not good .
this meal was horrible .
by the time it was delivered , it was extremely tough .
he too was disappointed .
order came wrong .
ordered a large pizza , half cheese , half hang ten .
i wish i would have .
tastes just like pizza hut , except square .
flavored crust and crazy bread , what ?
it was just a notch above supermarket stuff .
( seemed to already be going that direction as i ate ) .
and the garlic bread was ... ... yucky .
soggy and not good .
the crust was dry and tasted like days old bread .
not fans .
the pizza is , imo , on the cheaper side ( in quality ) .
stopped in to try .
staff barely spoke english .
wings were very small as well .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
this place is way overrated !
god i miss buddy 's !
the sausage was awful !
she said _num_ minutes .
it had an abundance of ham , salami , and cheese .
for $ _num_ , we expect a much better quality than we received .
it 's apparent you do n't need my business .
another time it was an hour before closing .
it was my first time trying their pizza and quite possibly the last .
i waited _num_ mins for my pizzas .
_num_ who does that ?
_num_ .
_num_ who does that ?
_num_ .
the customer is n't always right at this place !
the service was awful .
no apology nothing .
but on top of all that , the students almost never smile .
i only like the chicken tacos and green sauce , pretty good .
one california burrito and one carne asada fry with a side of shrimp .
worst roberto 's ever .
rip-off .
too bad .
i ordered carne asada chips but got carne asada fries .
yeah ... no thanks .
driving to the competitor 's store now to send at my own expense .
i got the california panini which had chicken , avocado , and monterey jack .
the downfall of the evening was the service .
wishing i could say something nice about eating here .
pissed off and left .
my order was handed to me by a guy .
i immediately called the restaurant and a guy at the bar responded .
a server quickly greeted us and told us we would be seated shortly .
just irritating .
once seated , menus quickly arrived , beverage selections made , and orders placed .
no big deal .
to be fair , the other three steaks were cooked perfectly to order .
i immediately sent them back .
!
i use more than _num_ myself .
)
why charge me for sauce when i 'm messing up my own table ?
terrible service .
terrible eating conditions .
horrible !
our order was wrong .
cold and super greasy fries .
but never rush it .
that way they can fix any problem you may experience .
odds are ( it is vegas ) you will !
they were obviously very very busy .
seemingly very annoyed .
this place is awful .
then he walks out of the room and does n't say anything .
nothing was done .
completely awful experience !
i highly suggest nobody go see him .
long wait to get an appointment .
longer wait to have surgery .
better yet just stay away .
worst doctor office .
called to make an appointment to get a second opinion for my daughters leg .
this is why we needed to switch to the closer office .
the care my son got was substandard .
they just do n't care .
he sent someone else in to give me the shot .
there are _num_ drs , available .
incredibly poor check-in process .
ugh .
totally unacceptable .
the incredibly long wait times .
so i went back to my chair .
do you know why these doctors treat patients like that ?
but i guess not on yelp .
delivery took double the _num_ minute wait quoted on the phone .
one of the _num_ pizzas was room temp upon delivery .
the chicken was diced so small that could have passed for a diced veggie .
i then served my daughter a piece , and she started eating .
i finished what i was doing then sat down to eat with her .
the little bits i thought were garlic in the sauce were actually parmesan .
crap .
i just wanted my money back .
the slices were n't great either .
how this place is getting _num_ and _num_ stars is beyond me .
the staff is very friendly but the pizza is too ordinary .
no bathroom for customers .
had to go next door to the dog food place to wash my hands .
i ordered a pizza , cheese bread , and chicken wings .
i live _num_ miles away .
makes you wonder if they wash their hands before preparing your food .
_num_ $ for only pizza and wings .
it was loud .
_num_ .
first of all , it was freezing .
_num_ .
_num_ .
nope , no bueno .
_num_ .
my sandwich was cold .
anytime she is there i leave !
this was not impressive .
the onion rings were great and the potato wedges were the bomb.com .
the owner should take a long hard look at his or hers staff .
so please a reply would or a post on your yelp would be appreciated .
the draft beer is really cheap and tastes fine .
i really liked the chinese chicken salad .
it was a slap in the face and we left there immediately .
unbelievable .
def not the best so not much to say .
nothing special .
ridiculous .
skip this place .
now i only go to cracked egg , egg works or egg and i .
this place was not very good .
i 've had better hamburgers at jack in the box .
try it for yourself , you may have a different opinion .
we were a party of _num_ with _num_ being children .
big mistake .
my husband , son , and i went to have breakfast one saturday morning .
we were seated pretty quickly and service was speedy and friendly .
not me .
eggs and toast were fine .
bacon was not good .
the coffee was horrible .
ugh , damn liar .
so that was it , they gave me my walking papers .
no bueno !
why even make an appointment ?
not a friendly bunch either .
not good .
worst experience ever .
nothing is further from the truth !
these are n't luxurious , they 're just there .
he was apologetic and did an alright job on my pedicure .
never cheat on your nail lady .
a disaster !
do not believe the reviews .
disgusting .
there was a fly that kept flying around my head .
excuse me ?
my worst experience every !
went to go sit down .
i was just here for my vacation and went to nail country .
they charge day time and night time fees without saying in the beginning .
very disrespectful and uncomfortable environment .
i came for a gel pedicure , manicure , and eyebrow waxing .
take my advice and never let anna do your pedi ever .
i walked in and ended up walking out .
why could n't one of them help me ?
cost me $ _num_ because after _num_ .
ok pricey but it was last minute .
went back to get a fill and got the same thing .
that 's disgusting !
do n't go here they do n't value customers .
this place hella sucks .

cheap linens and bedding .
my husband reserved a suite a week prior to our stay .
our room is a non smoking room but it reeks of smoke .
this building is dated .
gross .
cable tv was not working .
i 'm not a picky person .
stayed here over thanksgiving with my husband and three year old .
worst part of this ?
was like the maid never entered our room .
come on la quinta , get your stuff together .
never had an allergy in my life ( i 'm _num_ ) .
decided to try his pa , brenda , and immediately liked her .
not in this case .
someone that they were struggling to find with authority , i assume .
being in customer service for many years , i was amazed .
not in this case .
i called to request for an appointment , as i am a new patient .
very rude !
staff needs training big time .
brought my daughter in for allergy testing .
why are they not open on a saturday to accommodate people ?
staff needs training .
i fell for it and signed a contract .
bad idea .
i 'm no expert .
do n't sign the personal trainer contract is my advice .
worst gym staff ever .
this gym sucks !
bad idea !
they have _num_ large fan for the whole facility .
wrong !
this was my home gym for a while .
manager is rude .
it 's simply not kept up anymore .
so i 've been with this gym and location for almost a year .
so i 'm not sure .
my membership ends this week and i can not wait to try another gym .
drinking fountain out of order for at least a week .
the place it self needs an upgrade .
absolutely horrible customer service !
avoid this gym .
$ _num_ in additional fees .
avoid at all costs .
poorly managed , poorly maintained .
the worst customer service !
Neutral
absolutely atrocious wait times .
absolutely ridiculous !
not a good sign for me .
yesterday i ate at this location .
i ordered a spicy chicken burrito .
the fries i had been given were pretty delicious .
they were salted , crispy , and hot .
a typical del taco experience .
this was one of my less enjoyable visits .
it may be fast food but customer service should always be # _num_ priority .
i walked out .
not by anyone ive talked to .
no alignment was done .
i came to this location again today .
i have _num_ cars and my roommate has _num_ as well as an rv .
so , we went to firestone across the way to get a second opinion .
terrible .
they even charge per tire to throw away your tire .
worse experience ever !
never looked me in the eye , and was just snotty .
it is a materials warranty issue .
these tires are junk junk junk junk !
fail .
excuse me ?
zero .
Negative
so they gave me both my keys back !
however the bartender was polite though .
i went on a thursday evening around _num_ pm .
the worst !
only _num_ bartender on shift .
just make beer and serve beer but oh well .
i was so bummed because our awesome date i had plan was cut short .
so i walked out and will never return .
such a shame .
i ca n't style this .
it was immediately obvious that she had never waxed anything in her life .
discounts for my next three visits .
saw someone sit in the pedicure chair for over an hour waiting for service .
avoid at all costs !
first i hate liars .
to say i 'm livid about spending _num_ $ is an understatement !
she claimed at my first appointment i had _num_ cavities .
i can not chew on the right side without extreme pain .
bad news .
i was left with nothing .
completely rude !
horrible .
just plain horrible .
a spicy chicken sandwich combo with a side of ranch .
no ranch .
no chili sauce .
no straw for the drink .
too slow !
completely disgusted by this .
that was n't the fries where cold .
get your manager and get some more damn coins .
i will wait in the line across the street .
not friendly .
drove halfway across town to purchase a bike .
owner was rude !
_num_ stars if i could .
this review is for the service , not the food .
from my personal experience , that is how businesses operate .
they obviously have no clue .
crazy high ripoff prices !
you are a pharmacist , not a dr !
cause you 're not !
this walgreens is just ok .
lame .
she sent me to a second _num_ hours pharmacy .
i was sent to this location , because they could make the medicine .
i 've never seen anyone work so hard to get out of working .
i 'm currently cooling my heels in the parking lot at the store .
guess the decision 's been made for me .
ugh .
honestly , i hate this place .
i came here around 6:30pm this saturday for a car wash .
what the hell .
have been craving chinese food for about a year now .
tried this place last night .
let 's just say that i 'm still craving chinese food .
granted i have n't been looking hard .
got their egg rolls , bbq ribs and mongolian beef .
more like spring rolls i guess .
no duck sauce !
are you kidding me ?
sweet n sour sauce for an egg roll ?
the food was very cheap , and servers sweet .
this is nasty !
there 's better chinese here ; it just takes a good search to find .
i never had orange chicken and mongolian beef that tasted quite like this .
each entree was under $ _num_ bucks .
tonight only deserved _num_ stars .
this is why i wait to review .
not one apology .
so , again i am waiting .
Negative
the appointment .
worst experience ever !
shame on this business .
very unhappy person .
terrible billing department .
even though they claim they will `` in _num_ hours sir '' .
are you kidding me ?
horrible .
i 'm recommending my doctor to switch referring me here .
do n't bother .
the 2nd time minus having a _num_ hour wait went much better !
not friendly at all .
first , i 'd like to give the nurses their credit .
i tell him i 'm having an allergic reaction to some medication .
i mean , really ?
she proceeds to have me open my mouth and say ah .
do n't use this place .
i mean patients not staff .
ridiculous !
hell to the no !
i was promptly taken back by a nurse and put in a room .
ill never go back .
even if it 's urgent care or not !
this clinic is useless !
why bother going ?
wait time for treatment was reasonable .
doctors ) would get things correct .
wait time for treatment was reasonable .
doctors ) would get things correct .
i can barely move .
what a horrible doctor .
i absolutely hate this place .
awful awful quick care .
horrible clinic !
_num_ hrs with appointment !
this is insane .
been here for more than _num_ hours !
horrible !
why should they hurry .
hence i can not work .
what a horrible experience .
i will not be going back !
never again .
along with a new receptionist because the customer service really needs an upgrade .
i have seriously mixed feelings about this place .
the fees are also very reasonable .
they are probably some of the cheapest in town .
it 's almost impossible to get an appointment .
the waiting room is filled with cats .
my cat was very ill , and you never can reach anyone there .
you wait hours to pick them up .
a shame .
guess we 're gon na check out that wine & more store !
so sad !
the place was packed and prices were alot lower than lee 's .
discount is the key word , but without the really low prices .
staff not interested .
cashier can not leave register to assist .
closed for business .
suite _num_ is now a subway .
dropped off $ _num_ brand new shirt end of dec .
one side of the chains had been pulled out , completely obvious .
it 's terrible !
horrible !
note i am very picky .
that 's the only enjoyable thing about this pedicure .
the lady that did my eyebrows was on point though !
not to sure .
_num_ star for not having the special that 's advertised on yelp .
this is the second time i have dined at yummy sushi .
the server was friendly and the sushi chefs too .
i checked into this place on my _num_ year anniversary with the boyfriend .
service was really slow .
the food , however , is always the best .
this place was packed so were fortunate to get the last seat .
the _num_ roll was way salty ( mouth is still salted out ) .
my other roll was only okay .
you get a little cucumber salad to start , which was okay .
how did this restaurant get _num_ 1/2 star on yelp ?
big mistake .
i may try hot dishes on the next visit to give a full judgement .
live uni for _num_ bucks ?
no thanks .
i can get the same thing in los angeles for _num_ dollar a piece .
my family simply ordered the combo meals .
i 'm not quite sure .
it was disgusting .
when you 're in los angeles , go to little tokyo .
avoid this place .
expensive , disgusting .
i 've been here more times then i 've actually checked in .
and this was not good service .
i order hot green tea , my boyfriend orders hot sake .
i was very disappointed .
bad business !
this is not the place to get rolls .
three sushi chefs were present and busy when i was picking up .
verdict : not my thing .
wish this had been noted more clearly on the menu .
verdict : again , not my thing .
not fresh .
i was here for dinner late night on a friday .
very mushy and unappetizing .
that 's ridiculous .
cheesy place.
it was just ok .
service a little spotty .
if you 're craving sushi go to the southwest / spring valley .
firstly , the service was aweful .
i am so disappointed .
highly disappointed .
wo n't be back .
very disappointed !
we ordered this on monday , _num_ days later .
reviews are so fake !
price is fair , but totally out of my expectation .
horrible presentation .
we were greeted when we walked in & we were seated quickly .
it was n't really busy .
so he goes back and asked the owner again .
we let that go and order .
not cool .
very disappointed in this .
bad service .
would not recommend .
he even mixed a cucumber salad with his bare hands .
i wish them luck .
it 's confusing .
sorry i wasted my time .
i ordered a ultimate turkey club on rosemary .
ridiculous .
this visit was n't any different .
i noticed during my time there everyone need _num_ tires .
is n't that odd ?
two hours later , nothing !
disorganized , overpriced and dishonest .
i understand if it takes a lil longer i get it .
i was incredibly wrong .
like the other review says , the prices are outrageous .
this place is very expensive .
now it is nothing special .
so it took me well over _num_ hour for a _num_ minute test .
the quality of their employees are low .
not friendly and not professional .
that does n't usually happen at my docs office .
shame on the management .
that they can do .
terrible service .
wo n't go back .
not impressed .
very very disgusted !
do n't let a _num_ minute surgery fool you in recovery time .
ugh .
that 's not fair !
it is literally impossible to get them on the phone .
i took my son in for an appointment here in april _num_ .
okay , everything went well and i went back into my house .
maybe the food is just always cheap ?
poor poor poor service .
rude and disrespectful staff .
gross !
avoid at all costs .
this bar needs a major facelift !
went there with a party of _num_ .
gross .
_num_ ) presentation was deplorable .
when we emailed to complain , they sent us back a truly patronizing email .
it 's not authentic at all .
there were candles , i guess .
the only dish i liked was saffron seafood bisque .
all the french fries came with entrees were really salty .
escargot is always on my must order list whenever i dine in french restaurants .
our waitress replied chef said this is exactly how we serve this dish everyday .
i took my family for mothers day to this restaurant and what a disappoint .
wine pour was skimpy .
i imagine the investment in a power washer would be wise .
if you get nothing from reading this , get that .
horrible service !
i always tip a minimum of _num_ % .
if it 's awesome service , i tip over _num_ % .
it was bland .
the side dish was decent but not nearly enough .
ugh .
not kid friendly !
way nicer employees , better food and kid friendly !
what a disappointment !
so i just ate around them .
not going back .
he comes back and says it is _num_ % lobster and _num_ % crab .
also , last comment , the glass windows need to be cleaned .
they `` quickly '' fixed it and got me the correct food .
our reservation was @ 7:30 pm .
my entree was cold .
horrible service !
this place is so overrated it 's unbelievable !
now , i 'm not sure what happened .
this went on all night long .
this reaction annoyed me .
i 'm sure at one time the place was trendy - it 's died .
constantly had to remind our server to refill waters .
is n't part of the dinning experience and higher prices great service ?
not this day .
unfortunately , neither arrived .
so disappointed !
they put out of restaurant .
service very slow .
very very disappointed .
worst customer service ever !
Very negative
this place is bad !
lobster salad should be taken off the menu .
so disappointing !
will not go back again .
then the waiter was giving off funny vibes odd looks .
we ordered bloody marys , which were basically shrimp cocktail sauce in a glass .
i had a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce .
the turkey was completely spoiled .
shame .
bad experience !
one star only because there was n't a lower choice .
very rude service .
the service was appalling .
everyone around us got their food even though they sat down after us .
poop on your groupon i guess .
we will not be back !
the food is horrible !
poor quality .
my husband and i went in for a sunday brunch .
very disappointed .
i have a two year old and do understand not kid friendly dining establishments .
i never treated any guest the way we were treated today .
the service was terrible .
what a disappointment !
the sorbet arrived melted ; it was more like soup .
this is the second time trying to eat there on a saturday night .
the bad .
not stellar .
arrived at 2:30 on friday february _num_ for a late lunch .
he was a hard person to get a hold of all night .
the only choices for dessert were sorbet or creme brulee .
there was also a tiny serving of house wine .
he really liked it and it was just $ _num_ .
they really need a makeover in this area .
awful costumer service !
but she needs a course on costumer service .
but suddenly my order ur standing next to the oven to call my name .
then a gentleman standing next to me .
horrible customer service .
no communication .
if you ca n't handle the breakfast rush , then perhaps hire more staff .
left feeling hungry since i skipped breakfast in hopes for a delicious bagel .
went thru the drive-thru with my wife and daughter .
bathroom was disgusting .
restaurant need to be cleaned up a little .
service was n't all that .
service and cleanliness really need to be worked on .
man , that sucks .
she completely ignored me .
why are you being such a brat ?
gross !
pretty stupid .
the salsa was really chunky too .
no big deal .
eh , it is what it is .
no shit ?
big mistake !
the menu choices need to be clear !
i was literally grilled about why i was sending it back .
how gross is that ?
very disappointing .
a few months back i came in to get my tires balanced .
the worst !
are you kidding me ?
the worst ever !
i left almost in tears & of course i was in panic mode .
they quoted only $ _num_ !
i went in to get my brakes checked and almost died twice .
then jay called me said truck was ready .
quote un quote .
too late .
big word of caution though !
pep boys needs to send its employees to customer service training asap .
i am a loyal pep boys customer and i hesitate to write this .
they do n't even deserve one star !
stay away from pep boys !
quoted me $ _num_ .
had it repaired , not replaced , yesterday for $ _num_ .
need a good mechanic in las vegas , let me know !
just left this location .
it 's my fault .
worst customer service ever .
dumb .
never use this pep boys .
this place does n't even deserve one star .
worst customer service !
very rude .
very poor service !
pep boys needs more employees like him .
terrible customer service .
a very dirty place .
however , this location disappoints me .
i could have designed a more legitimate looking invoice on my own computer !
we were very frustrated .
i am not impressed at all .
it 's place i am definitely not look forward to visiting again .
japanese make teriyaki usually with shaved beef or chicken pieces .
is this fusion ?
it 's basically cheap , fast faux teriyaki bowls .
i even asked for veggies well done .
today is not that day .
disappointing ... .
must be new owners .
i have been to this location before and it was pretty good back then .
not as much food as before either .
my mistake .
i ca n't stand that .
my wife got a normal chicken bowl with cabbage .
no cabbage .
ridiculous small portions .
was not impressed at all .
i 'm so disappointed .
their towels smell like mildew .
does anyone know how i can get my belongings ?
ca n't say the same for palm medical group .
what a mistake .
but no .
he had to rush off to another appointment !
so , my next review will have to wait until i return again .
first off , some women brought their seven screaming kids in for dinner .
the cheese was good at least and they used plenty of it .
and i should get more compassion from a doctors office that specializes in cancer .
i 'm sorry !
worst serve ever .
zero stars !
do not go here !
place smells like chemicals and tech rush the job .
not a good salon .
i usually get pedicures once a month .
its been about _num_ weeks now and my toe still hurts .
$ _num_ gone .
yes , $ _num_ !
this place is horrible !
Negative
i use to go here .
but i really think they water down their drinks .
terrible service .
big mistake .
i was gambling and only comped two drinks .
service was slow .
consistently horrible !
no thanks .
way friendlier there and better service .
soup with no crackers ?
very disappointed .
long unnecessary waits sometimes !
poor customer service .
this location sucks !
it 's disgusting !
if she is n't better in _num_ weeks , she will need surgery .
cats are n't like dogs and just stand there .
she surely is hiding something .
you were warned .
he had razor burn all over his stomach .
why _num_ minutes ?
i was thinking to myself after the experience why i even waited that long .
all my food was cold .
just plain horrible .
not cool !
the standards at this location have been on a steady decline .
service here is awful .
let 's start with the service .
lame customer service too !
the food is never prepared correctly .
i was disappointed !
remember , i came here for brakes .
their name is `` just brakes '' not `` tune up '' .
my air filter was replaced a week prior and was brand new .
total rip off artists .
$ _num_ for brake pads .
the burrito could have definitely used more potato .
so i went back when it was time for a new set .
wo n't be back .
completely unprofessional and rude .
a two taco for a buck was way better than that food .
i guess this is the only location not open 24hrs .
service was not the issue .
thumbs down ... .
i never went back .
do not eat here .
so this was my first time trying baja fresh with friends .
horrible service !
so disappointed .
freaking weird as hell .
i had to ask .
ick !
make sure everything is in order before you leave .
rather drive down to jack n the box on craig .
so i shall just find other mcdonalds to go to when in the mood .
they forget stuff all the time .
by nature i 'm not a very critical person .
alright , i 'm just going to lay it on the line .
false advertising !
will not be coming back .
worst .
get your store in check management !
i ended up buying _num_ .
food was n't that good either .
this place is not consistent .
terrible .
unbelievably rude .
she gave me the hash brown and apologized again for the confusion .
the employees sit and have casual conversations while they should be helping customers .
this place is garbage !
employees there are so much friendlier !
i was sent to a back room with some kid to get my piercing .
they had body washes that were fifty percent off .
unacceptable !
i was pushing my cart and was looking for hummus .
me : where can i find hummus ?
i was going up and down each aisle trying to find my dang hummus .
the sister casino , fiesta henderson ?
poor selection of channels .
but you could do a whole lot better too .
the security was sloppy !
im like wtf ?
thats fucking stupid .
i can totally see why it was a ghost town in there !
this casino , which looks very old , probably seen better days .
when it opened in _num_ it changed the game for local casinos .
as for the ice arena , it 's pretty awesome !
it 's not as big as you think it would be .
ugh so gross !
that was my only concern on my last visit .
worst place ever .
my girlfriend and i stayed here because we thought it would be super cheap .
i 'm not a big slots fan ; i prefer _num_ .
$ _num_ was the lowest .
our non smoking room still smells of cigarette smoke .
royal flush capitol of the world my ass .
this place is gross .
please tip them well as they really deserve it .
the mexican restaurant was good but pricey .
_num_ ) i called around 5pm or so to book the room .
say that up front instead of lying to the customer and stealing their money .
avoid this place .
my eyes burn because of the smoke .
wish stations just close down the _num_ fiesta properties .
chicken was dry .
i hate this place .
problems started as soon as we checked in .
the people here hate your business !
would not recommend it to anyone .
no room service .
the house cleaner & yes there is only one .
she was the only employee who was nice & helpful .
horrible !
suffering from it as i type .
on the station casino app , it says that it opens at 8:00 am .
i put in a ticket and $ _num_ .
ok , i want to see the video you watched .
for making decisions you just feel like making ?
_num_ pool table .
i cant believe this kind of business is still running .
cant wait to see them in small claims court !
$ _num_ for _num_ week .
all they do is take a copy of your driver 's license .
there are other choices to stay short term .
this place sucks .
the manager looked with so much hate as if we did something to her .
i go there this time with just my boys and were treated like dogs .
nurses ca n't tell you anything .
so my 2nd trip here is much more nicer than my 1st .
seems like there is new doctors and staff .
call for an appt they said they take walk ins .
aid came back telling me the prices etc then same thing .
all you do is sit in a room and wait .
i cant even begin to express how livid i am right now .
just asked me questions .
the next pet we brought there didnt seem like she cared .
anyway , we took him home and the next morning he passed .
another reviewer mentioned the high staff turnover .
and cheap .
_num_ star from me .
umm , no !
all they did was talk to me and not check on the patient .
vets do n't typically stay with their patients .
that is a far cry from $ _num_ !
so he comes back very quickly to say she wants to see the cat .
not cool !
that was _num_ min ago .
had appointment at _num_ am .
would not recommend .
everyone be very careful .
( even if it 's a dog ) .
i chose craig rd because it was close and it was very early morning .
ok , that and they got me in quickly on a sunday .
my livid bride asks if ears were even checked .
i almost fell over .
i was just looking for basic information .
this was _num_ days later .
this is very upsetting .
it looked sketchy .
she was n't having it .
she said the sausage was popular .
my first review of this place was from my buying experience .
but i would say this is the best las vegas has to offer .
i might as well eaten a bag of concrete .
so i make the trip there , really strange looking neighborhood and place .
finally got to a hotel parking structure and was ready to feast !
overall not good q .
zero flavor !
all three were dry .
i 'm not a big fan .
i might try the butcher though as an alternative ... .
wait gets long - get there early or try another day .
not mind blowing barbecue just nice family style place .
skip it .
not a good destination bbq joint .
hopefully i just saved you cab money from the strip .
brisket - sitting in a broth pre sliced .
this is criminal .
pulled pork - the pulled pork was better than most .
peach cobbler - almost the highlight of the whole meal as it was tasty .
it also came with corn bread .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
there were flies everywhere around the food while they were serving .
we ended up going to in n out nearby , which never disappoints .
the bbq is tasteless .
do n't .
are you kidding me ?
another guy desserts and ringing you up .
sides of mac & cheese , potato and mac salad and baked beans .
place needs security and a better ordering system at meat counter .
the rib tips was all fat .
the chicken was mediocre .
nothing special .
i had the ribs , brisket and sausage .
this was very unprofessional .
the bbq tomato sauce was ordered spicy , but needed more heat .
after all the hype i have heard i decided to try this place .
about _num_ oz .
but very average , nothing special .
very disappointing .
the cashier quickly apologized and asked the server to get a new brisket .
not going back .
from the cheese bread ( wonder bread , maybe ? )
for a meal you could easily get at applebees , the price is nuts .
this is an old time restaurant that has some charm .
a let down .
the service was slow .
the sauteed mushrooms were sauteed in too much butter .
just not worth my money .
wait staff was very nice , we ordered crab stuffed mushroom for app .
the twice baked was harder than a rock !
my twice baked potato was decent .
the whole place , while definitly historic , needs cleaned .
there 's an `` old western vegas '' feel to bob taylor 's .
established in _num_ , it 's the oldest restaurant in las vegas .
but they are not putting enough care into the food .
and there were at least _num_ steaks cooking when we arrived .
i ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak .
it was just ok .
worst service ever !
i ordered the prime rib with the twice baked potato .
not the experience i was expecting .
_num_ hours .
went in at _num_ , and were asked if we had a reservation .
she brought out my new lobster tail .
gross !
i ordered the scallops entree for $ _num_ .
scallops did not seem fresh .
my daughter ordered bbq beef tips off the kids ' menu .
i could be wrong .
i went here for my friends birthday dinner .
my friend ordered a ribeye and i would think it would look somewhat better .
her husband ordered a steak as well and his was overdone .
service : horrible !
cracks in the walls , and not so clean flooring .
potato , sauteed mushrooms & vegetables were good .
nothing prime or rib about this grilled piece of rib eye .
very disappointed !
so much damn fat on the ribeye !
it grossed me out !
i expected much better for a steakhouse .
disappointed ... .
have n't been there in 30+ years .
nothing has changed .
1st appetizer was crab cakes .
entrees : scallops & _num_ oz filet mignon .
for $ _num_ for _num_ - done !
extremely bland food .
i had the smoked chicken and i could have made it at home .
not worth it .
had a porter house steak that was pretty tough .
i drive by almost every day and tell myself , i 'm going there !
well , i went tonight .
service was a joke .
drinks were weak .
the service was lacking .
we will not be back .
worst service ever !
one star is too generous .
have been there _num_ times .
last night , not so much .
however , i needed a chain saw to cut my prime rib .
then he just walked away .
we were a party of _num_ and _num_ of us split a steak dinner .
okay - no biggie .
very frustrated .
i had been dying to come here due to hearing great things .
bland !
another restaurant i can cross off my list .
terrible service .
there was one bartender for forty or so guests around a massive bar .
_num_ of us ate there late in the evening .
it was freezing cold in there .
food was not worth the price .
so many other options out there for better food and better prices .
with that said , it is still bar food .
and for what you are getting , the prices are a tad high .
very disappointed .
if you 're super hungry , the ribs are okay .
do not use the bathroom .
but the changes are not positive ones .
so , so disappointing !
cheese curds , beer cheese soup , pot roast , and sausages are awesome .
i begin calling my bank .
he gave my card away !
horrible .
the pasta was way over cooked .
the cheese curds were great and my burger and fries were delicious .
service is very slow .
like she was avoiding us once another waiter finally served us our food .
she did n't check on us .
mixed review , it 's ok , i go here ... sometimes .
yes , nasty .
i 'm much better served coming here in the warmer months .
no thanks .
i will not be back .
patty returned to our table with three gift cards for $ _num_ each .
with that said big dogs draft house name says it all .
none of that .
not impressed .
the food was blah and overpriced .
service was slow .
ridiculous .
going back to autozone !
worst customer service .
this is ridiculous !
i 'll eat the $ _num_ and go else where .
this place sucks .
many times i 've gone i 've seen fights .
this place is ridiculous .
this is all feels like a place that you would come to die .
walked in to hear girls just want to have fun .
my first interaction was with a telephone call .
yikes , more professionalism is definetly needed in their employees !
customer service sucks .
so sad .
it is neither .
oh and i have pictures from beginning to end !
what a nightmare .
my dog is doing much better since i took her to a different vet .
i hate these damn thieves .
very poor customer service .
stared me down .
this has been my convenience store for a long time .
i even took my shirt off so they could try bare skin .
now they are calling me again , two days later .
the drinks may have been pricey .
just do n't expect too much .
very slow service .
only went because a friend 's band was playing .
apparently the new ownership has n't made a difference .
it was disgusting .
just got an invite to see them play there again .
no thanks !
this place is gross .
in the end i spent less money total .
they taste like styrofoam and have a chemical after taste .
cheap deals but seems a bit pricey when u compare the prices .
we stayed _num_ hours .
they have to get to know their regulars , they bring in more people .
the music is terrible .
lucky not a lot of people to run into each other .
if you just wan na skate , go .
no accommodating paying customers .
this place just does n't hold up .
it was pretty gross .
i would n't come back .
i would n't trust this place ever again .
sucks .
rude , disrespectful and unprofessional .
and kept asking me to leave the shop and come back later .
terrible experience .
horrible !
yes i said garbage !
no seriously .
this place , if i may say , is get toe !
short wait time at the register .
sad staff .
( probably wished to be home ) .
i 'll only come here if i need to .

in addition we drove down historic route _num_ .
horrible customer service !
in the end , we gave the credit card number and received reservation email .
this grand canyon tour company is not disabled friendly .
this company does n't care .
grand canyon tour company needs some work and needs to fix some problems .
wow a plain white bus , which one do i get on ?
the next stop was the grand canyon .
no way .
like other reviewers stated , they did heard us like cattle .
the car was only $ _num_ including mileage .

okay , that was probably worked into the lower price .
Neutral
if the colored contacts are n't covered , the regular would be fine .

the chicken with mixed vegetables was good , but only the vegetables .
the fried rice was fried rice with egg .
no vegetables .
avoid at all costs !
however , your delivery driver asks if you want change back .
i was wrong .
you can tell cheap ingredients are used .
for the prices they charge , they really need to step up their game .
no no no no no no no .
we ordered a soup a beef item , crab rangoons and fried rice .
we ordered our two favorite pies last night .
man i am so bummed about doing this ... .
needless to say .
i 'm not a animal print girl .
the location is horrible .
whoever is pricing these items needs to take a second look .
Positive
they said nothing .
she ca n't even walk .
that 's not our problem .
then he cracked a smile as if he was amusing .
i went to lee 's a few days ago for ginger beer and wine .
i 'm actually i 'm looking for wine .
nothing .
completely disgusting .
i came to several services , and was never welcomed .
but ... that being said , i encourage anyone to try it out .
there was definitely talk about god , but not much of the bible .
for a side , i ordered the skinny fries .
not until they fix the issue with the hand towels .
if i ate it i would end up in the hospital .
not even worth it .
so so so bad .
remember , i 'm with my _num_ year old .
i walked out so upset .
she under cooks it the patty & never wears gloves .
she has made many customers loose their appetite & walk out .
it 's gross .
i 'm not surprised .
still no response .
it was almost $ _num_ .
the burgers were decent , but not spectacular .
anyhow , do n't go .
and do n't ask how rare their prime rib is .
ok , maybe its just me .
( not so ) .
do n't sale yourselves short on that rule .
i stayed on a thursday night on the fourth floor .
the bathroom inside of the room is a little deceiving .
there is wifi in the room but it is not free .
it was a little scary and a little awesome .
it all seems a little sketchy with just a dash of scary and crazy .
_num_ ) old school _num_ '' non hd tv .
i get it , they want you out of the room .
but my recent stay ( of one night ) will hopefully be my last .
wrong .
two thumbs down .
dealers dont shut up and cant run a game for the life of them .

i was expecting much more for our money .
customer service is lacking .
)
walls were paper thing and you could hear everything next door .

the place smells like smoke too despite being on a non-smoking floor .
avoid this hotel .
such an awful attitude !
the internet is not free !
does n't make any sense .
super tight slots here , you would be very lucky to win $ _num_ .
they charge you , then give it back , then charge etc !

these rooms were just down the hallways of each other .
there were stains every step you took .
i will never go this shit hole ever again .
slow service .
would n't return or recommend .
so far she has not responded to my request one way or the other .
you have _num_ hours to respond .
i 'd try my luck at a different hotel .
the air is super smokey in this casino .
it 's difficult to get a cocktail also .
disappointed .
did i mention slow ?
thats just ridiculous .
so rude !
there was no ticket .
seems they have things a little backwards ... ... .
disappointed .
the quality and selection of the breakfast items were less than desirable .
it was not worth it .
services were terrible !
extra towels needed to be taken off the maid 's cart .
the mattress sucked !

overall , the hoover dam was incredible .
and the bus started rolling backwards .
worst customer experience !
thankfully groupon showed how a company should treat a customer and refunded the money .
horrible !
still way too much money .

so they fixed the truck again ( free of charge ) .
long story long ... .

i opened a platinum savings account with wells fargo at this branch .
lousy lousy service .
their $ _num_ pedicure is merely a polish change and hot water soak .

thumbs down !
terrible for the price !
terrible experience with tiffany .
completely unprofessional and unacceptable .
there is never any tables open if you want to use the wifi .
i really wish they had a drive-thru at this location !
was not pleased .
worst location .
the eggs in the fried rice were completely black .
so i stepped out , leaving my mom to finish shopping .
ive never been told not to step in and out of a store .
it is not illegal .
like i 'm trying to steal lotion and pull a fast one .
who is that rude ?
i 've used coupons from groupon at this location and others before .
only because it 's convenient .
like they say , it 's all about location i guess .
running up and down the halls , screaming and laughing .
would not use them .
i found a florist closer to home for $ _num_ less .
i have previously gotten flowers for my wife from this place .
maybe $ _num_ at most .
_num_ .

this was our first visit and was just our annual exam .
will not go back .
this office is awful .
mediocre at best .
my fiance and i ordered our old favorite , chicken fajitas .
the environment is cozy but the food was a bit too salty for me .
terrible !
terrible customer service !
they came back with another cheese enchilada .
also looking at the fine print it had said alcohol and gratuity not included .
he told me that this was mandatory and had always been charged for groupons .
this mexican place is located on and/or near a golf course ... ?
no salsa .
no sour cream .
no guac .

he just seems like he 'd rather be somewhere far away .
there is a charge for chips after the first bowl .
there will not be another visit .
i was really disappointed .

terrible .
do yourself a favor go somewhere where your business is appreciated .
they do not care !
they are rude and careless !
and , even with the coupons , the place is not cheap .
poor customer service .
finally , my boyfriend also used to go to this dry cleaner for convenience .
not just in vegas , but ever ... anywhere .
on top of everything else , the prices are ridiculously expensive .
it 's just a way for them to rack up the bill .
it should be criminal .
it does n't sound like the dogs get out a whole lot .
they certainly are n't getting the exercise they need .
hello brandon adams jewelers !
sales lady was extremely pushy .
i have never met such a pushy sales person in my life .
it 's only $ _num_ and it puts the buyer at ease .
all _num_ star material so far .
it 's not a favor .
dishonest !
never a problem .
originally i had scheduled the cleaning and exam for the same day .
i scheduled an appointment for dec _num_ .
i went to a different dentist after my initial visit in _num_ .

Negative
_num_ months later go by .
what a nightmare !
really stupid question !
so i will be made to wait again ?
it 's a tuesday and nowhere near a holiday .
my first visit was for discomfort .
only the exam .
as for me , i prefer someone who values me and my time .
disappointed .
it can be a little creepy during the day .
but if you do n't like carrying around a card , go for it .
this club is the least friendly in las vegas .
the staff at this location very rarely say hello to me .
obviously this is my least favorite club .
i had big expectations for this gym .
he showed me the pool , it was pretty standard .
no privacy no protection whatsoever .
so i said to myself , okay just let it roll off .
just terrible !
if you are asian , you are not welcomed at the basketball court .
i guess planning the towel service is a bit difficult for this group .
what a disappointment .
horrible !
the men 's locker room is quite shabby .
most recently i ran into their fitness manager who i believe is drew .
this is nothing out of the ordinary .
stupid or nah ?
horrible business practices .
i called in to the corporate customer service and got it resolved .
the worst experience ever !

this place is horrible !
big thumbs down .
from this point on !
not anymore !
she never responded to anything .
do n't go to this salon .
do n't go to this salon .
the result is that the sides of some of my nails are rough .
she tried three different ways to convince me that gel is better .
no thank you .
my girlfriend and i went in to get a mani and pedi last week .
they took us promptly but that was where the positives of our experience ends .
i expressed that it hurt , did she stop and use another technique ?
are you kidding me ?
_num_ star = terrible .
multiple things went wrong .
never going back .
_num_ star = not good .
_num_ star = good , not great .
med grill in decatur .
the pita bread was dry .
dry and tasted terrible .
step _num_ : call to order for take-out .
no creamy for me .
the good is generic at best .
has the gyro and the stuffed grape leaves .
the gyro meat was dry .
they were sour .
but i was wrong .
as mentioned before , not on a pita , you get flatbread .
the pita bread was hard and dry .
i will not be returning .
what a disappointment .
also , the manager is never friendly .
because if you ever had real greek food than you wont like this .
the chicken is sooooo dry .
the people were nicer than the old people who were there .
i want my money back .
thumbs down !
i ordered a cucumber salad , chicken shawarma pita and chicken kabob .
the pita was dry and crispy .
the bread was a dry tortilla and not a fresh pita .
rather mediocre .
not the money but the point .
either put it on or let everyone know that it is a dry sandwich .
it was only $ _num_ so u sure ca n't complain about the price .
i 'm so sad .
the worst mediterranean experience !
horrible !
waste of money !
and i went back to support a local business .
well that was disappointing .
i ordered a gyro salad and bowl of the lemon chicken rice soup .
i 'm still craving some good lemon rice soup .
no issues .
then i had used them again , for a _num_ day weekend .
avis was slightly higher by maybe $ _num_ .
hertz was a lot higher ( i forget how much ) .
no thanks !
if you want someone to get dust off , then this is your place .
i go here every _num_ months to get an oil change and car wash .
i was wrong .
the smog check tech was very professional as was the cashier inside .
i went through the car wash and had the interior done too .
not so easy .
heck no .
i want the _num_ cent per gallon discount , are you crazy ?
she could have cared less .
ridiculous .
big mistake !
did n't really include vacuuming .
never again will i give this place my money .
here now over an hour to get my car washed .
i went there last sunday for a car wash and vacuum .
it cost $ _num_ .
i was so disappointed .
what the hell ?
i could have washed my car in the drive way and saved the money .
car wash ?
ok , rant over .
nothing fabulous to report .
car wash was n't good either .
horrible , horrible .
the manager was rude rude rude .
second bad experience .
which all i asked was the red sand be vacuumed out and wiped down .
horrible and disappointed !
it seems like nothing has done to my car even the vacuuming .
not only that but i noticed they had actually damaged my car !
this place is unreal .
did not have a fabulous experience .
i will not be back !
i only come here to get my eyebrows waxed .
horrible !
i was a regular until they just rushed me out of the pedicure chair .
poor service .
overall bad customer service .
i refuse to go back .
today was the worst .
not for the first time .
not worth the trouble .
bee did my nails and she did a f @ $ & ed job .
horrible place !
bad bad bad customer service !
so i tried one more time for the last time to come again .
big mistake .
by the time i picked out my color i was next on the chair .
it was a total of $ _num_ and i paid in debit .
i 'm never returning to this salon again .
my thumbs are noticeably crooked lol .
no fitness area .
ca n't wait to move out !
maintenance is a joke .
this starts at the first hole , and continues through most of the course .
three rounds feed _num_ , so it is close enough .
wrong cake , wrong color .
rude too .
even worse !
however prepare to sweat because it 's as hot as it is outside !
rude customer service !
are you kidding me ?
this pharmacy is totally understaffed .
this is the first review i 've ever written .
my veterinarian called in two prescriptions for my dying dog .
no shit right .
i immediately called my vet to confirm the script .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
this is ridiculous !
pathetic .
it is hard to see the ball and it is not visually appealing .
there is no pro .
1st off i was in between _num_ and _num_ stars .
me ; huh ?
it 's either _num_ ; _num_ or later .
a big disappointment .
poor condition .
this course is nowhere near worth the greens fees they charge .
_num_ .
conditions were piss poor .
staff was awesome the course just kinda let us down .
that was pretty disappointing .
borderline terrible .
average course in terms of layout and difficulty .
but very poorly kept .
bad advertising !
this is based off of a one time visit .
the worst service ever .
but she really needs to get it together .
poor service .
i just ordered food from there an hour ago .
i 've been trying to call them and their phones are busy .
rude !
very bad people skills .
i will not go back .
this is my local grocery store .
this store , after shopping at sprouts , smith 's , etc .
i do not recommend this business .
big disappointment !
extremely poor customer service !
i loved this cleaners before .
the worst shakes .
greasy whip cream that filled up half the cup .
how would _num_ packets of ketchup be enough for all of the orders ?
total disappointment .
the worst ever .
employees seem to play around too much .
no apologies .
they said they will send me copies of all the paperwork signed .
abandoned old cars left in the parking lots .
they are already closed .
in a year nothing has changed .
it is probably grown here !
nothing happens ... for two or three weeks .
do n't throw anything personal away here .
roach infested , management does n't care .
would not recommend .
nothing has been done to prevent them .
do you really have a roach problem ?
the shower head leaked and sprayed water all over .
from day one this place has been nothing but trouble .
took them almost a week before it got done .
all of the sinks had multiple leaks .
_num_ a haircut .
very very rude .
_num_ minutes tops .
i come in and the man who was getting a shave is gone .
the other three stylists are still playing around with the register .
no one says bye .
these people keep calling my home phone to leave messages for their patients .
the receptionist then put me on hold .
apparently it was a huge inconvenience for me to do this to them .
these people are stupid .
i waited maybe 30-45 mins past my appt time .
so needless to say , i dont plan on going back .
worse staff ever .
i have gone to women 's specialty care under dr. kelly for two years .
no , really ?
worst doctors office ever !
needless to say find another place !
it is not professional .
she just waist my time .
would not recommend .
sounds sanitary , huh ?
i wish i had taken that call .
this place is ridiculous .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
seriously !
just because it 's in summerlin doesnt mean it 's better .
had severe kidney stones .
if i get a satisfactory response , i may change my rating .
it 's just ridiculous .
Negative
when i checked in i guess it checked into a different one .
my husband went into emergency after an accident where he cut himself .
_num_ .
avoid !
summerlin obviously had a pediatrician in the er so that 's where we went .
then you wait some more to see someone in registration .
terrible !
so did things get better after i had the baby ?
they forgot to get me my dinner , its okay i only just delivered .
not really but i was certainly paying for that with my time .
absolute worst experience ever !
a miserable experience !
incompetent in every way .
_num_ hours and nothing .
it 's _num_ till _num_ .
er was less than ideal .
you get to stay in _num_ room the entire stay !
again , stuff happens .
the end result was i could contact medical records and get copies next week .
i thought summerlin hospital was a better facility .
you decide where you want to go .
i was in extreme pain the entire time and nobody helped me .
i had extreme knee pain and obvious injury .
the only medical attention i was given were x-rays and pain medication .
oh , i only seen the doctor once after getting medications into my system .
on every occasion .
summerlin hospital is not your friend .
we waited sooooooo long for an iv and tests to be done .
worst hospital ever .
i asked the front desk where i could go and she said the bathroom .
ridiculous !
not okay .
was unable to walk .
do not use the kiosk .
went to this hospital as it it closes to my home .
it didnt seem like the staff was attentive to the needs of the patients .
i would find another doctor .
rude !
she was always rushed and never listened to me .
bad bedside etiquette .
granted , i have n't been to the doctor in three years .
looks like i need a new doctor .
it 's a shame .
finally it is 2pm and i get results that require a follow up ?
unacceptable .
i have selected a different doctor .
still no apology , nothing .
did i mention this was the 5th time calling ?
like a little shit .
they are rude and unfriendly .
still no apology , nothing .
ummmm i did !
unprofessional and poor customer service .
that leads me to january _num_ .
so i 'm left trying to find care for certain members of my family ?
it looks like i will be following him to his new practice .
when i scheduled an appointment the only doctor available was dr. barnes .
when i went , i had _num_ different concerns .
_num_ of my concerns she was valid on .
it was like he was rushing us out of there .
they do n't deserve it .
as far as customer service is concerned they simply can not rate .
wait times , medical request etc .
with my son .
and the waiting room is a zoo .
ugh .
not worth it .
horrible place !
wait us awful .
they just schedule and schedule .
horrible experience .
my daughter had a _num_ o'clock appt .
worst service ever !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .

imagine had i not brought it up again ?
just plain lazy .
very disappointed .
horrible office staff !
i have been trying to get appointments for my three kids for two weeks .
i made one visit to this office with my _num_ month old .
i would highly recommend avoiding this practice .
it 's very sad !
why did n't you ever tell me ?
the staff repeatedly looked in the same spot over and over again .
each time not finding it but looking again and again .
since this year started , it is next to impossible to find parking .
ridiculous .
unacceptable .
my food is never accurate .
oh how i wish capriotti 's next door was open 24/7 .
one star only because it is just not safe .
bad business !
bad business !
otherwise , this place has management problems .
that was back in summer of _num_ .
problems with the previous apartment ?
and the worst part ?
private schools want money .
not an institution for learning .
do n't expect too much from this school .
why only _num_ stars ?
very frustrating .
horrible place !
very sad !
its not creative kids its children in the yard !
let me just start off by saying this review is long over due .
the worst experience !
do n't leave your kids there ; there are other places far better .
it 's your child , they deserve better .
it all starts with kelly , the manager for business .
i 'm very unhappy .
first off , i visited rc of nv .
will not answer your questions .
it was over $ _num_ .
avoid these people .
doctors know it and accept it.
it 's strange to dread getting gas at a certain gas station .
garbage .
these apartments are very old .
the appliances , light fixtures , and washer and dryers are old as dirt .
we also pay pet rent .
so pathetic .
just do n't do it .
nothing special .
i had a coupon so stopped by for lunch .
i had a turkey club and a double slice of cheese pizza .
the turkey sub was just okay .
the service was not spectacular .
started ordering with one guy , he walked away and another jumped in .
i called , they said they fixed it .
extremely long wait ... usually 2-3 hours before you get to see her .
just felt like sitting in a sauna and sweating .
but there were none ( ding # _num_ ) .
next was the _num_ minute massage followed by a sugar scrub .
weak !

_num_ stars for this place ?
this place is bad .
as for the place , it was really small .
another down side to this place was their portions .

so they offered to give me a soup the next time i came in .
this does not make sense .
worst customer service ever !
it had more of the wonton crunch noodle things than anything else .
nah fuck this place .

the answer is nothing .
makes me a little nervous about this place .
pizza was just okay .
i ordered their hummus as an appetizer which never made an appearance .
this place is garbage .
chicken lettuce wraps stolen from pf chang are not tapas .
if you want tapas , go to firefly .
disgusting !
went here friday night for dinner with hubby .
even for free meal !
wife and i stopped recently for lunch .
she ordered the chicken wrap ; me the chinese chicken salad .
said the chicken was being fresh cooked .
wife 's wrap was more robust with chicken , but not noticeably fresh cooked .
however , i was not impressed .
no bueno !
tapas , lettuce wraps , tacos , hummus ?
very little mahi mahi .
seriously , not very good .
to my shock , the pizza sauce was spicy .
next thing is we 're bring served by entirely different server .
i 'm not going back .
this location is convenient .
we picked off some of the cheese and toppings and ate what we could .
i 'm so sad !

i usually get _num_ clams per order .
sushi quality is low .
we walked out .

they stare at you like there 's a stick up their butt .
the place was n't even packed .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i have ordered sushi _num_ you and sushi combo for _num_ .
fish never taste fresh and this is a fact based on _num_ visits .
way overpriced for their low quality items .
not appetizing at all .
the wings were pretty good , but not spectacular .
again , disappointment .
i dunno .
i just did n't get it .
my favorite are the little notes around the room ... .
eh i was just expecting too much i guess ?
i am glad i walked the length of the casino .
i also bought some hair gel , it was decently priced .
we parked in the back and left via poolside as much as possible .
this place is dirt cheap !
service is slow .
almost a lil too spicy , but darn tasty .
ugh .
thank god , maybe this place will close down soon .
let 's go to hooters and munch on some wings !
oh man , i 'm drooling already !
drinking the rest of whatever we have in hand .
drunken stumble into the hooters casino .
no chicken wings ?
where i could eat anything and everything and not gain a pound .
scratch that , that 's an understatement if i 've ever heard of one .
the whole casino is done out in the typical hooters style ( i.e .
shitty self rated hotel online .
_num_ stars for this hotel ?
food still sucks .
waste of time ?
ummmm , wtf ?
no hooters girls here ?
not a big fan .
give me a reason to come back , hooters !
the room is tolerable .
the chicken was just chicken , but delicious all the same .
like how can i have never visited a hooters .
are the wings over rated ?
i just want a hooters pen , god .
lame .
no thanks , hooters .
no thanks .
number _num_ !
there is a reason they are off the strip and nobody goes there .
just stay away .
for the price there are so much better things .
oh boy , where do i start ... .
and the hot wings are not free .
talk about false advertisement .
i popped in $ _num_ into the penny machine and won $ _num_ .
the place was dead .
nothing says breakfast like wings an beer .
they advertise that if you sign up , you get $ _num_ slot play .
not worth it .
not impressed .
there is a sign that says guaranteed same day check in .
* the room was large .
_num_ stars !
hooters hotel and casino is exactly like their restaurants .
tacky ?
not a fan .
my friend and i walked into the hooters hotel .
we looked for these $ _num_ blackjack tables .
positives :
maybe .
please realize i said , `` hanging '' out her shirt , not showing .
ok ... it was cheap .
the whole casino here feels sleepy .
this place has a great location if you wan na be close to mgm .
there were two queen sized beds for you and a friend to share .
so it 's ghetto , but cheap .
what a dreadful casino .
so , yeah , not exactly a sophisticated cocktail lounge in manhattan .
cheap tables it is .
avoid hooters !
it really felt like you were at hooters restaurant just with gambling .
bad customer service .
the hotel is a run down dump .
but for under $ _num_ a night i cant complain too much .
its about _num_ degrees and salty .
my friends and i stayed at hooters for two nights , tuesday and wednesday .
the food 's terrible .
ok , maybe just i would think that .
nothing special about hooters wings .
it really could have used some butter .
the blue cheese dipping sauce came out of a peel away packet .
first off , this hotel is ghetto !
consider yourself lucky if you happen to find parking .
and a few _num_ something year old cocktail waitress ' .
hooters is crap .
service is crap !
this did nothing .
in the end , they comped my room .
at $ _num_ a night plus $ _num_ resort fee its a great deal .
i stayed here for _num_ nights for only $ _num_ a night !
basically with this place , you get what you pay for .
decor is cheap and the building looks very old .
i have not been back .
i like how its cheap , but does it really need to look cheap ?
the casino is small and seedy .
what you expect from hooters , enough said .
do n't do it !
inexpensive small hotel casino that offers little else .
regarding the hotel and casino , they are both shit holes .
anyway typical hooters menu ... i got my usual fried pickles !
anyway that was my hooters experience in vegas !
nothing says dont come back better than that .
the location is convenient , the staff was courteous and professional .
my left arm had a total of _num_ .
my left leg _num_ .
disgusting !
ugh .
this place actually smells like chicken wings .
after all , thats the point of coming to vegas , right ?
just a bad experience .
the casino here is small , sticky , and everything smells like chicken wings .
the front desk people are never very friendly .
the only issue that i had inside of the room was the shower .
bad idea !
and the pool actually looked descent .
so i settle with a smoking king room on the 3rd floor .
spend the extra cash to get a better room at a better hotel .
beers were cheap .
review for $ _num_ wing deal only .
terrible !
do n't be fooled .
-they do n't sell the $ _num_ bud lights here .
then , you have to buy a _num_ wing minimum .
not a fan of the hotel .
i get wings and some onion rings and a diet coke .
next time i 'm in vegas , i 'll pass on hooters .
there is so many better places to eat .
ugh ugh ugh !
man , for being such a great chain for wings , this place stunk !
not ok .
the rooms were extremely cheesy .
no no no no no no .
not hooters .
not a hoot .
it was all horrible .
the absolute worst !
they keep the prime stock in the hooters restaurant .
the beds were kind of musty , but sheets and room were cleaned daily .
it was pretty sad .
i know , i know - what would you expect ?
tough , there is nothing we can do , that 's policy . ''
what a shame !
this place sucks .
kinda depressing actually .
service is slow .
this past weekend , spent _num_ days in vegas .
she said nothing they could do .
not surprisingly , they found a room for us too .
they also were n't sure that our room was occupied .
shortly afterwards an alarm began sounding from the service elevator .
we ordered boneless chicken wings and fried pickles .
bad # _num_ check-in .
# _num_ different drink prices thru same hotel all run by hooters .
# _num_ ghetto towels for pool so you do n't steal them .
# _num_ price of room when on special .

not a favorite of mine personally .
i was really craving fried chicken .
the service was terrible .
not interested .
not worth visiting at all .
horrible horrible hotel .
everything is fairly cheap when compared to the other hotels .
the sports book is laughable .
plug your nose as you reach the sidewalk going to the tropicana .
went in last week for dinner before hitting the casino .
ca n't say much for the food as i only had a beer .
unacceptable .
greasy tasteless stale food .
i ordered wings and fries and my husband had the chili and fries .

everything about this hotel/casino really does suck .
outdated ( vintage ? )

_num_ servers !
at the next table there were guys complaining receiving drinks for an hour !
friday night the drink situation was better but still could be improved .
will not be going back .
no wifi , really ?

hooters should stick to making wings and even that comes into question .
pretty ridiculous .
they then called us back and brought some up for free .
the hotel room is okay and the pool area is nice .
will not be coming back .
next day , ac broke again , then internet .
it 's not worth it .
the food was terrible .

the linens and towels felt hard and cheap .
this is vegas and hooters , weird !
this is vegas and hooters , weird !
yet , it is n't .

this is your place .
this is when i walked away .
however , i 'm big on customer service and this place has none .
hotel is a joke .
old wood floors and metal ceilings .
crappy shower curtain .
hair dryer did n't work .
my husband and me stayed for a weekend in august of _num_ .
no charger .
no hot water !
fail !
small hotel makes for a crowded lobby jammed with slots .
but $ _num_ ?
hell no .
we were very disappointed .
wrong !
so he says were more than welcome to leave our food has been comped .
it would be in your best interest not to come back .
i went here with really low expectations and they somehow managed to fall short .
in a group of _num_ , three people sent their food back .
i would definitely come back to try the other _num_ flavors .
i get it , you 'd rather deal w/ drunken tourists .
they 're too drunk to care .
i 've always been a fan of hooters wings and curly fries .
this is the only hooters that has n't been spot on with the wings .
service was n't great either .
but it really is n't on the strip .
it 's too small and smokey .
totally disappointing casino .
pretty bad atmosphere .
bar was disgusting .
really let down with the whole experience .
next time , i 'll just spend the extra money .
this place is depressing .
however the hooters restaurant is aweful .
the hostesses do not know anything .
then again it is hooters .
the elevators were slow and dirty .
the rooms was disgusting .
the good : cheap .
this review is just for the hooters restaurant and not the casino or hotel .
hooters restaurant sucks .
current bartender not very strong .
like everything is this world , you kinda get what you pay for .
the food and other waitresses were less pleasant .
the ranch that came with wings was pre packaged .
granted , it 's hooters .
zero .
you 're not that funny .
that said , the servers were nice .
it was irritating !
do n't turn on your tv in your room .
unacceptable service .
i stayed here with a group of _num_ in _num_ different rooms .
not a fan .
old tv too !
carpet was peeling away from the wall .
tough job , and unfair to both staff and patrons .
not many towels but enough .
no refrigerator .
also our television in the room never worked .
stay away .
crap .
sooooo slow .
oh lord , where do i begin ?
the room was disgusting .
oh yeah , the cracks in the ceiling were pretty awesome too .
i would highly recommend staying some place else .
lame .
the pool was descent .
i was stoked at how cheap the bar was .
worst customer service ever .
dont spend your money here .
worst customer service .
booked a room with a king for the weekend without the kids .
big mistake .
customer service : horrible !
worst place in vegas !

the staff are polite and when they knew , helpful .
the pool area is 24/7 .
the beds were super comfy though !
$ _num_ blackjack was the best thing about this hotel/casino .
spent _num_ hours at the pool with friends .
3pm till _num_ : pm .
building is so run down .
was expecting the same experience i get when i have gone to their restaurants .
i guess that 's why they offered it for free .
just wearing short shorts does n't cut it , how about customer service ?
place is super cheap and need tons of upgrades .
extra fees like anywhere else .
so the ol hooters huh ?
yes this place is dated .
very dated .
in the room is the smell of their wings from the restaurant .
you can go out to this little balcony to see the pool .
maybe not .
staff rude .
hooters was the cheapest option on the strip and now i know why .
we stayed for two days and our room was never cleaned .
really david ?
very unappealing .
there were much better places for slightly more for the same nights .
that alone freak me out .
i would not recommend this place .
will not be going back anytime soon .
next time i meet someone at the tropicana , i 'll pick the bar/restaurant .
the wings were small and the girls were trying too hard .
next time , i 'll wait in my car .
i do n't mind hooters , the restaurant or the hotel really .
overall , a typical hooters experience .
gross !
once i entered the hotel i got the overwhelming smell of throw up .
i do n't recommend this hotel .
this was my first time in vegas .
that being said , the staff was super friendly .
we just spent _num_ nights at hooters hotel over the thanksgiving weekend .
we were very disappointed .
we have stayed there in the past that is why we booked there again .
our sinks were clogged had to call maintenance .
they gave this place _num_ stars .
this place was absolute horror .
i was extremely upset at this because i know what i saw and heard .
coating was thick and not particularly crispy .
not yummy taste .
and they had $ _num_ shots of crown royal .
did not bother gambling .
is there something else in the room that needs a remote ?
once it was confirmed we walked up to the desk to check in .
the service was awful .
will never come back here ever again .
this hotel is disgusting .
they also might steal your card information .
i stayed at hooters on dec 7th my rooms were bought through groupon .
hooters las vegas you are the scum of the earth .
ok , so check this out .
when she came she was very apologetic that i thought she actually cared .
wish me luck folks .
i suppose i expected this place to be amazing .
it was fairly cheap so i got what i paid for !
it is located at the end of the strip and parking is free .
it is a long walk but who cares !
hotel was extremely filthy .
do not stay here .
i was looking forward to supporting this establishment ( girl power ) !
customer service were n't too friendly , although professional .
i really wish they took more time on the details .
( gross !
bathrooms are what you 'd get at a cheap hotel .
it 's quicker to walk to the mgm grand and wait there .
i just want to cry !
i guess it is a craps shoot on the rooms .
it might be a craps shoot to get a good room .
this experience was horrible .
cheap , fast check in and out was excellent .
not cool .
the darn ac was sooo loud !
terrible service .
everything stinks of smoke !
the manager who checked me in needs training in hospitality .
completely horrible and horrific .
_num_ .
make sure you check your bill before you leave !
this place is awful !
not even coffee or towels .
the only modern thing in the room was the coffee maker .
why did we do this ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
it feels like a hooters restaurant that you can stay in .
this is a cheap place to stay and you get what you pay for .
could 've stayed somewhere better for the same price .
let me sum up my experience at the hooters hotel & casino .
Neutral
parking is free which is a plus .
worst service !
pay a little more and get a better hotel .
the hotel is a little shabby .
the exterior of the building and parking lot needs a little touch up paint .
never stay at hooters .
the bed blankets are dingy and have stains .
i ordered wet wings i mean ... hot wings .
im so angry .
she obviously only wanted to take care of her male customers .
i probably would n't go back .
casino : cheap gambling , which is good if you go to have fun !
it took twice as long as the average wait time .
on sunday i went to hooters around 3am .
for some odd reason there was still a wait to be seated .
it was pretty ridiculous .
the walmart shower curtain does n't go the length of the tub .
_num_ .
nothing was cleaned .
the bathroom floor was not clean .

i said not really .
disappointed is an understatement .
i get into bed and there is again more unknown hair .
so at almost _num_ in the morning we get to make our own bed .

easy access and not a far walk to the strip .
she stated `` yea about 7am that reservations come in at 6am '' .
i just ca n't wait to get home and shower .
they were so small that a mcdonald 's chicken nugget was bigger .
i only stay here when i get a good deal .
sometimes i get a good deal , like $ _num_ .
with resort fee like $ _num_ .
the dealers i was playing blackjack with were total bitches .
worst hotel ever .
dirty carpet and restroom .
it is one of the cheapest if not the cheapest hotel by the strip .
this is the reason why we picked this hotel .
our bathroom counter was about to fall so we were careful using our sink .
then theres about _num_ roulette table open and _num_ table for craps .
the slot machines are not so many as well .
little view of the pool , _num_ beds , and a door .
same towels in a pile on the floor .
towels were still in a pile though .
i was given a check in as well as check out time .
really wish management would reach out yo me .
being vegas , you get what you pay for .
over priced and disgusting .
pay the extra money & stay at a better place with better service !
never stayed here , just know the casino area .
we were so disgusted .
do n't stay here .
you have been warned .
customer service very unfriendly .
i stayed at the resort next to the hooters casino .

we purchased a two night stay from friday check in to sunday check out .
horrible , horrible , horrible !

no excuse .
the ones i 've dealt with walk around like they are above everyone else .
i will not stay here again .
it has a cheap motel feel .
beds were uncomfortable .
it was n't good .
here is a list of problems i encountered while staying here this past weekend .

this hotel is the epitome of low budget .
it was a white sheet ( at least the bedding was very clean ) .

i 'm not exaggerating !
for three days there have n't seen any workers though .
no apologies given .
it was disgusting .
room style worse than .
but never go again .
because this establishment does not care .
i hated it !
go anywhere else that has better corporate values and cares about their customers .
avoid at all costs .
finally they upgraded me to a suite .
the drain was slow .
also the place looks like it was about to fall apart .
the hallways look outdated .
stayed here for one night with my wife on a business trip .
this should be last resort for anyone to stay there .
this place is a scum hole .
you want cheap prices in vegas but still want a casino ?
somehow they do n't care .
got booked this hooters hotel by a site that gave it _num_ stars .
the first thing i noticed was how musty this place was .
it is gross .
ridiculous .
would i stay here again , probably not .
stayed in vegas this weekend at this hotel .
could n't get any air !
i made several complaints and finally got the shower fixed but not the tv .
the real reason i came there was to get some wings .
whenever i think of the name hooters , i think of the restaurant !
not a hotel or a casino by any stretch of the imagination .
less than _num_ minutes ?
all around just gross .
avoid this hotel .
only , i could see from the outside that they did .
reviews here a low for good reason .
hotel seems cramped and dated .
sat down in main restaurant .
what a horrible experience !
room was ok .
nothing to rave about .
i have been going and staying to hooters for many years .

i visit hooters in just about every city i go to .
we ordered wings , crab legs , and buffalo shrimp ( hot ) .
the wings , however , were really good .
as a hooters fan , i can take or leave this location .
also , the pool was being fixed .
not worth it .
so rude .
background ... this is the 4th time we 've stayed in this hotel .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
as for any kind of entertainment ... nada .
no really !
i am truly amazed that an establishment like this can stay in business !
booked on hotels.com last min .
he bought the room off of groupon for about $ _num_ .
as for the cons , read my review as well as others posted .
_num_ stars from me .
avoid rude people !
ok , so the casino is a small one floor casino .
overall , not awesome .
food is awful .
this hotel was chosen for it 's price tag .
someone had stolen the cable to the tv .
the walls are thin .
the dirty bedding caused this .
after leaving it cleared up very quickly .
the rooms are dated but always clean and never smell like smoke !
so terrible !
i even left day earlier than anticipated .
i would not return again .
lame !
enough said , anna was highlight of my stay .
_num_ stars only for anna the waitress !
i believe someone dropped glass in the pool a little girl stepped in it .
it was very unprofessional .
she was rude .
you guys need gordon ramsey to help you out with that .
i do not recommend this place .
i order the chicken pho , with both white and dark meat .
- the pho was pricey at _num_ for a large bowl .
to my taste buds , pho has to be piping hot .
the egg rolls were eh .
cheap filling eats on the strip if you like vietnamese food .
i would think they would only use chicken breast ... .
my wife and i went to pho saigon _num_ yesterday .
_num_ .

nothing special - just ok.
not good .
not much service .
communication is limited .
this place is meh .
nothing too spectacular .
this was the worse .
so let me start off by saying i 'm vietnamese .
would not come back here again .
give you ugly faces .
it was not good .
two seconds after we sat down they asked do you know what you want ?
not great customer service .
little pho saigon has little heart in their business .
you 'll leave feeling like you ate nothing at all .
disappointing indeed .
would not recommend the pho here .
the pho soup was super sweet , either too much sugar or msg .
in short , they need to train this guy on how to service customers .
will not be back !
so disgusting .
avoid this place !
go to pho so _num_ down the street .
dry old spring rolls .
horrible customer service .
poor service .
btw , my three dogs gave the meat two stars .

ordered two bowl of pho .
do not eat here .
this is customer service slap your smile on and sell the damn restaurant !
services is pissed poor .
my friend 's friend insisted on going here before heading home from vegas .

will not come back here , ever again .
and horrible customer service .
food was cold and so plain .
the broth was n't so good .
service is horrible .
living in orange county , i 'm very spoiled when it comes to pho .
the young waitress in the front was a big ass attitude .
not gon na come back .
it seems like they have never tried authentic vietnamese food before .
i had beef pho and my friend had chicken pho .
wo n't go back .
the bf ordered flank steak and only had literally one piece of meat .
now off to another local barber to see if they can fix it .
mediocre haircut at best .
she said size _num_ then size _num_ .
my son was really upset he cried for a long time .
service sucks !
lower your cost people .
not coming back .
this place is low quality .
mediocre .
i would not get these again , why ?
gross .
talk about cheap ; they 're being thrifty !
this on its own makes you lose your appetite .
i could not believe it .
unacceptable !
however , with all the sanitary issues we noticed , i 'm skeptical .
pork adobe was literally swimming in grease !
they gave very small portion of the noodles .
really freezing like a walk in .
food is no good .
a while ago , i came to this branch just to deposit a check .
they were trying to get me to open another account with them .
i 'm avoiding this branch forever !
slow service .
i had a recall taken care of there .
it turned out i needed a new thermostat and a complete flush .
i asked the service agent why their service was so much higher .
about ready to sue them .
they should n't even get one star .

it 's hard for me to recommend after that .

the sandwiches were filled with roast beef and the prices were great .
_num_ .

my husband sandwich maybe had three slices of roast beef , if that !
_num_ .
i thanked him for the heads up and declined the add on .
this was only my second time there the last .
another guy rushed into the lot right after me .
_num_ mile round trip back to get the right part .
no other solutions available .
especially because it was wings , salads and sandwiches .
Negative
the office phone was ringing off the hook .
i mean , is this thing on ?
they do n't return messages left .
they treat both owners and tenants this way , it apparently does n't matter .
the result , at least for me , has been delays getting anything done .
they provide nothing .
zero stars ?
just wished we could have done it sooner .
it was several inches long .
do n't take it here .
brand new mattresses are labeled `` all new materials '' .
spend a little more & get a decent mattress at a reliable business .
extremely difficult to deal with on the phone .
fail .
not impressed at all .
it 's where the social security building is so do n't miss the turn .
she simply could n't care less .
it 's now _num_ and i 'm just leaving !
this place is a joke .
it was never received by walgreens .
i recommend everyone go to max pawn , over this place .
the reason i 'm rating it so low is the staff .
they continued conversations amongst themselves without ever offering to help me .
without bothering to purchase the dress i picked out for my mother .
rude !
it was almost laughable .
for me , customer service and attitude goes a long way .
i also appreciated their selection of south american sodas .
this is provolone cheese seasoned with oregano and then grilled .
it was sad and boring .
each time , it is scrumptious .
not a fan .
i love dive bars , but this place was just seedy .
but then again , every dog has his day ; i ca n't wait !
not very personable either .
she should n't be there .
say atleast excuse me ?
she needs to go back to training or stay in kitchen .
mcdonalds food served by english language challenged people .
i 'm not a mcdonald 's eater .
the food gets cold fast because of the temp of the restaurant .
not a good mcdonalds .
okay , at first , they were going to get a great review .
wrong !
the company could n't give me another chance .
poor experience all around .
avoid like the plague !
ca n't expect _num_ star customer service and food .
you 've been warned .
all i can taste is cheese , bread and chicken .
when they make a new one it usually is made correctly .
just cold noodles .
cold , hard pizza .
this review is long overdue .
worst dominos ever .
so all in all a ok place to go .
still i gave them another chance .
i used to stop by polish deli regularly .
seriously depressing .
extremely rude .
i 'm a fan of thrift stores as a rule .
this place is nasty .
it 's cheaper , probably cleaner .
really disappointed .
i 've been coming here to get my pants hemmed for over _num_ years .
at this point , i was in tears .
how many times can someone 's father die ?
`` wait , i have to come in to set up an appointment ? ''
this is an update to my original post .
because your patron will find it and decide never to visit your establishment again .
i am truly disappointed .
hence the name , i suppose , breakfast seems to be a better choice .
so we get sat after a bit of a wait .
double order of over easy eggs with sausage patties .
we arrived around 10:30 , and as usual this place was packed for brunch .
we will try another breakfast place before returning here .
did n't finish it .
my husband and i used to eat at this restaurant all the time .
that just was n't going to happen .
my husband saw it , and my baby jumped when he did it .
this review is really late .
rude service !
i could n't believe my ears .
you lost our business .
my hubby goes and gets some rice and what did he find in there ?
no stars !
place is disgusting .
gross .
so rude !
so cheap !
so cheap , right ?
other stuff was just meh .
i ca n't quite understand why so many people like buffet at asia .
i used to frequent this place but everytime i go i feel very sleepy .
i dread going back because of how i will feel afterwards .
it 's like the easiest thing to make to perfection .
so in total there were around nine of us .
my dad , of course , went to go complain at the front .
i 'm the customer and you 're not ! ''
the value is in the mongolian stir fry .
in my opinion , this is what buffet @ asia is .
to end this review , make sure you use the restroom at home prior .
do not recommend !
not much seafood .
the selections for me were minimal .
wrong !
i barely ate .
couldnt stand being in the place that long .
one word ... gross !
we tried this buffet as it was highly recommended by a friend in hawaii .
i was not impressed at all .
the food was mediocre .
the selection was very limited .
this place was horrible !
that is unacceptable !
Negative
very very rude staff !
they had salt and pepper squid , which again was okay .
this place is always busy so food is constantly coming out .
worst customer service ever .
not worth the drive or money .
the selection is not great .

this place is horrible !
the half tray will just be half of that tray .
shame on this restaurant .

very little food to choose from .
would n't recommend to anybody .

i 'd give them _num_ stars if i could .
i would not recommend this place !
when entering you get very cramped up when it 's busy .
if that does n't mind you , then go get lunch !
however , the service was alright until today .
how rude !
seriously , stay away .
if you need to fire anyone , it would be this person .
took my husband here because he 's had this weird cough for months now .
-no private area ( club house ) for host a special occasion .
why even bother .

think twice its $ _num_ each hole in the wall .
left after only two months in .
the administration is awful !

not a good combo .
and they toss your order and move on to the next person .
rude .

they have the same staff that just rotate between the two offices .
the whole place is a big mill organized to make money for the practice .
that really sucked !
worst experience ever .

the fries have never been hot every time i go there .
but then i tried the food .
not the greatest selection of stuff , lots of kids toys though .
not a real big mens clothing selection either .
i walked through the door and was met with ... .
disappointment .
really small , very cramped shop .
prices are not the best .
dr. arnold has removed cancer from me twice .
obviously freezing was not working .
want to know how i fixed it ?
service was friendly , place was clean .
so i left .
i walked out and walked back in .

disappointment !

they make you fill out paperwork and then send you over to the cashier .
so he finds my paperwork and starts reading off my old address .

eh ?
worst bank either .

this place sucks .
worst management company ever !
such a difficult company to deal with .
i try to deal with them as little as possible .
every time i have to contact her it 's a pain .
horrible comp .
not to mention that they raised our rent without any notice .
do your research before you move and beware southwest management .
on the job in las vegas & earned _num_ times the monthly rent amount .
she is lazy and condescending .
my husband spent time here and fell several times .
this is just unacceptable !
salad was just salad , but their house homemade ranch dressing was amazing .
the menu is limited which is fine for a bar .
they were dishonest .
i was promised _num_ % interest .
okay , i have never actually been here .
read on to see why i am reviewing this place .
me : `` hi , i would like to make an appointment . ''
then i get this victor 's voicemail .
left a message and he never called back .
i 'm not an idiot .
i will never buy another toyota .
just overall bad experience .
shady ass sales people .
very very bad experience !
i hope i never have to return for service to this location .
very rude service .
i ended up buying the car .
autonation toyota on sahara !
salesperson : `` hello folks welcome to toyota autonation .
i must really have to buy my car here .
there is too much competition to think you can just ignore people .
the appointment was at _num_ am so i brought the car in .
_num_ hours .
once the salesman returned , he told us `` okay , i 'm back .
you 've been warned .
do i just sign myself into my own service appointment , or ... ?
from the salespeople to the cashiers , i 've gotten attitudes and rolled eyes .
it really kills my vibe when i come in here .
and they 'll wash my car for free .
shame on you !
you lost our business .
_num_ sounded reasonable .
too slow .
_num_ dollar for a oil change ?
they also told me how expensive oil they have used on my car .

zero stars ... ... .
i waited _num_ freaking hours !
Negative
i even scheduled an appointment and i still had to wait .
service manager told me chuck was at lunch .
i went to get some lunch and came back around 2pm .
nobody even acknowledged my presence .
everytime i get my maintenance they always take forever !
always taking _num_ hrs to check my car and do some maintenance .
i called centennial toyota , it 's a different quote .
an easier method would be to cut them off right from the start .
horrible service manager !
they simply do n't care .
too late .
terrible customer service .
waste of time .
complete waste of time .
slowest place ever !
Negative

is this anyway to run the worlds largest auto maker ?
went to hugo 's desk ... turns out it was his day off .
checked my email confirmation , and it was with hugo .
this place is ridiculous !
zero out of zero .
this place is ridiculous !
zero out of zero .
i explained to him that the car was lose power and would die out .
quite the opposite of most dealerships i 've dealt with .
folks , i work in the auto business and i 'm not a fool .
i had an appointment last monday and have never felt so unwelcome .
ridiculous !
so incredibly rude .
zero customer service .
he said they can fix it immediately for $ _num_ and some change .
however , the sales floor is where the customer service stops .
getting an oil change takes a minimum of three hours with an appointment .
the parts guy sent me back to service .
it should not have been necessary .
their service department has let me down time and time again .
i live _num_ miles from this dealership !
purchased a new vehicle , february _num_ .
no loan , no nothing .
i drove _num_ hours to las vegas for this vehicle .
only one of these was actually installed .

horrible customer service .
terrible .
in _num_ my family purchased a car from desert toyota ( now autonation ) .

unacceptable .
worst customer service .

rude employees .
i was generally dissatisfied with my experience at the toyota dealership .
horrible service .
purchased a groupon for an exam , cleaning and x-ray .
very rude .
the metal they use is really soft and wears down quickly .
no show .
first off i do n't remember her saying this .
fast service too .
_num_ dollars flat .
price was slightly above average according to my husband .
think of how many people the f over .
shame shame .
first i have always taken my suv to the same company to be serviced .
i was not satisfied at all .
this could have only been done by this jiffy lube .
!
we have _num_ vehicles regularly serviced by jiffy lube .
avoid this location .
he said they were done and was ready to take payment .
very bland .
there were tip jars on every counter and little direction .
i 'm glad i checked it out .
the flavor consistently fell short from the caesar salad to the chicken parm .
the server and the chef were extremely helpful in answering questions and making suggestions .
not my favorite .
not my cup of soup .
ultimately i was disappointed .
never had that combination fish with pasta .
and its not cheap either , i would say lunch food for dinner price .
terrible just terrible !
these people are awful .
terrible .
never ever set foot in here .
they always say the same thing , it is fixed .
i would high tail it to another dealership .
this review is for the collision shop , not the service center .
the worst customer service .
big mistake .
i 'm sticking with henderson nissan when i make a purchase .
they also sent me to another dealership for service in the future .
they actually made me cry .
i just want to know if you sell a regular cab truck .
very sad .
do n't even deserve a star .
after a second follow up email , he responded ( two days later ) .
boy was i wrong .
customer service sucks .
so i approached another person and he said oh let me get somebody .
no apologies , nothing .
how rude .
this is not worth it .
are you bored ?
few better in vegas except maybe an urgent care on a holiday !
except for the one in henderson , the rest of them are on sahara .
they replaced it _num_ months ago .
the only technician i recommend is an old guy named ed .
Negative
if a customer comes into the service area , you do n't ignore them .
it was like pulling teeth to get in touch .
since day one they have been regret than satisfaction .
never understood the purpose of having an appointment at the places .
dec _num_ tuesday he say this .
i noticed all associates here wearing name tags except him .
got an accident and my car was total .
called about _num_ times always forward me to voicemail .
a disaster !
they certainly were n't getting me the best deal .
it was soo terrible !
i got a better car with more options and _num_ % financing to boot !
i went to get recall repairs done on my nissan .
for the same price that they charge you here for an oil change .
you can get a package of _num_ at planet nissan .
their sales team gets the _num_ star .
bad experience .
never get what you order .
just sad .
i wish i had the service that everyone else was talking about .
the problem with this statement ?
and if you can , try to fix it yourself .
however , i ca n't say much about the other stuff .
spent almost _num_ and a half hours there , entirely waiting for food .
theirs was disappointing though .
spend your money elsewhere .
not very nice .
bad tables .
had to tape up the legs so not to scratch floors .
do not trust these people .
try some place else !
customer service = _num_ stars .
cleanliness = _num_ star .
in my _num_ zip code , this was the highest rated burger king .
gross .
has terrible terrible service .
absolute minimum wait time .
its the only business left open in the shopping center .
wish i 'd gone that route .
very rude , unprofessional .
horrible .
worst burger king ever !
rude !
bad service .
do not live here.
the highlight for me was the beer .
to wash it down , i had an iced tea .
also , do n't expect their seasonal beers to be on tap .
tonight was a total let down .
bad mistake !
thank goodness i used my coupon for $ _num_ off of our check !
so , i chose the burrito .
it was also smokey and loud in here .
the beer is just average .
try installing at least one tv that is n't _num_ years old !
it feels old , and so is the staff .
i have eaten walleye at the sahara location every friday for _num_ years .
i 'm going to miss it .
the beer was my least favorite part of going to big dogs .
i also think it 's odd that they serve dim sum until _num_ pm .
i still cant believe that this place is so busy .
ive had to wait quite a while the last few times ive come here .
- you could taste how much effort they put into their food .
the pros were that the food came extremely fast after we ordered .
the service was awful !
definetly not the best dim sum place i 've been to .
it tasted a week old and the shrimp was off too .
not very soft .
roasted duck over peanuts - nobody ate it .
it was disgusting !
it was cold .
dim sum is suppose to be hot .
horrible i tell you .
apparently they have _num_ late night menus .
apparently the english menu is much more in price .
worst service ever !
he immediately gets someone ( again ) to bring out soup .
after the meal , i was so thirsty .
= ( how lame !
gross .
we will not be back .
disgusting !
not to sure what has happened to this place .
its very disturbing to see how he treats the dim sum ladies .
we visited on sunday , 8th of september and it would be our last .
there is a limited dim sum menu for night time .
still over priced for the dim sum offered .
would not recommend .
tomato beef chow mein was pretty decent though .
?
they microwaved our dim sum in front of us .
depressing .
nothing more to stay .
the highlights from our meal were the custard buns and crab balls .
if you like dim sum you must only go here for lunch .
dim sum is prepared fresh and brought out for you to choose .
this explains why .
disgusting !
sick sick sick .
after reading further reviews , i really question how they prepare the foods .
they are very slow .
plate of noodles we ordered were taken back to kitchen to be microwaved .
the food was cold .
it was prime time ( 12:30 pm ) when we got there .
we will not be going back .
worst dinner experience .
this place has officially closed .
do n't eat here .
worst experience ever .
it worked for about _num_ months until both units stopped working this past saturday .
this was on a previous review which does cause me some concern .
i woke up to an _num_ degree house .
my ac had stopped blowing cold air .
the first time he came out today was around _num_ am .
i guess it would , since the a/c was blowing hot air !
we got it fixed within _num_ hours with another company .
prices are too high as well .
two months later my pet died .
they are strictly indoor cats .
she contacted our current vet to verify what shots were needed .
so that was the my request was to have that done .
she simply took his weight down , & placed us in a room .
went to check out and rang up a huge bill .
they refused .
what a horrible experience .
look at their ratings on google , etc .
if you can go anywhere else , i suggest you do .
no staff was onsite .
the chicken katsu was dry .
convenience not worth the stop !
received my _num_ mustard dogs for $ _num_ , and went on my way .
it 's not .
drove off without ordering .
i have never been here so i was excited .
im not a fan .
disgusting .
very rude receptionist .
this is ridiculous !
( i 'm going to try and use as few details as possible ) .
i 'm _num_ years old , so i 've had my share of them .
the camarones , too , were as tough as old leather .
this is not it .
i 'm left stunned with all the five star ratings with this joint .
( quantity is not a problem here ) .
the verdict : disappointing .
for tacos , anyway .
cheap food and quality .
drive thru is open till _num_ .
food is ok , you get your greek craving .
meat was not that tasty .
not greek style for sure .
this sauce was sour cream cucumber and some salt .
i could not believe it !
no no no .
bland and overpriced .
you lost a customer .
every time i pass by this place , it 's busy .
fail .
zero , zero , zero .
do not go to this place .
this place just messed up my all leather dash board .
only go there if you have an hour to wait .
ridiculous .
_num_ star for customer service of cashier .
she said i ca n't .
it 's too late .
it 's $ _num_ .
have n't gotten my car back yet so we will see how it is .
my other issue with this place is that they need a better cleaning crew .
this place is terrible .
ok turkey breast ?
it was n't even that good .
ate here many times as a kid .
the store in my neighborhood went under and the one on tropicana did too .
first of all , i was looking for a chicken combo meal .
you know , a couple pieces of chicken , fries , and a drink .
the turkey itself is a breaded patty and deep fried .
might as well have been a piece of rubber and styrofoam .
farm basket ?
... and i 've had better mashed potatoes lunchtime at a chinese buffet .
after having one on this visit , i must disagree .
not really .
i agree with jamie p 's review ; the food is not quality .
new management is turning farm basket upside down .
we were so disappointed .
the coleslaw was pretty much just shredded cabbage with a little milk added .
the `` crunchy '' chicken was more `` crunch '' than chicken .
gross .
are you kidding ?
tasted less than any fast food chain except at twice the price .
i guess people like going because it 's been there so long .
indeed they did , about _num_ of them , just behind a different fence .
so we walk back and i pick out what i want .
went there to buy a shade tree .
anyone whose been through this knows , it 's a pain .
i always reserve online .
i 'm not the one who asked for the damn upgrade !
maybe next time i 'll call ahead to prepare them .
i will not use this location ever again .
worst experience ever !
wish i could give less .
total was $ _num_ .
charge was $ _num_ .
did n't care .
plus the noodles and rice suck !
no more !
just ordered black pepper chicken for $ _num_ .
two thumbs down .
the chicken pasta was pink !
my husband had the chicken caesar wrap and a side of salad .
very dry chicken .
not very tasty .
these just did n't taste right .
kind of wish they would put another restaurant in rotation .
i could never sit through that again .
just mediocre .
blown away by the response and tone he directed towards me i patiently waited .
the white meat was very dry .
not worth going back .
my wife drives by this place all the time .
the ribs were dry and rough .
no refund of anything .
never going back .
slow as hell .
_num_ people working in the back and _num_ customer in the lobby and me .
not worth the wait .
the only way you could improve is as i suggested .
_num_ .
_num_ .
seats that can support a child ( bare minimum ) .
_num_ .
_num_ .
worst food ever !
big mistake !
we got mixed fruits , corn , mac n cheese , and caesar salad .
the second time i ate there after purchasing the yelp coupon .
it was then that i noticed the place has small roach problem .
i was addicted to their wings and would stock up on them regularly .
their posted business hours are until _num_ pm at night .
meh , i 've had better .
so i ordered a _num_ piece chicken meal with _num_ sides .
in addition the chicken was dry .
i exchanged them for the bbq beans and the coleslaw which were definitely better .
never going back .
this was the first time i have been to `` nevada chicken cafe '' .
the experience was nothing special .
i think thats why i constantly go back .
fuck nevada chicken cafe .
if the half chicken meals are this small i could eat _num_ chickens then .
mashed potatoes ?
husband was not happy .
full chicken , rack of ribs , and three sides .
the chicken was dry .
food was mediocre .
went to the nevada chicken cafe off of rainbow blvd .
first of all it was so noisy !
tips are n't guaranteed .
so i ordered the chicken and _num_ sides .
this place is horrible !
my coworkers and i tried it out just the other day .
let me tell you something you are not on tv .
what to i see ( not to my surprise ) mr .
may i suggest a future more fitting career change , prison guard .
normal gas looking grill , back is surrounded by a brick wall .
next to that cart is the soda fountain with pepsi products .
i got the chicken breast , wing , 1/4 rib combo .
the combos came with a little salad and one flour tortilla .
for my side i got mashed potatoes and gravy .
food was horrible !
she stood it up between a counter and cabinet just behind the register .
then slammed it into place with her butt .
my watermelon came out of the same container after her hands were in it .
the mashed potatoes were ok .
customer service sucks .
and price is expensive .
so , that is why there is a health dept .
we went for the ribs on saturday evening at _num_ pm .
they just changed our order without asking .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
very skinny chicken .
so so so disappointed .
garlic ranch and the salsa flavors to be exact .
as for customer service , the staff seems friendly .
but that is not my business .
we tried and failed .
and the _num_ reps gave me different dates .
i instantly put a lock on my social security number .
idiots work here !
these people are ridiculous .
done shopping here .
bad news !
do n't send your loved one here .
i am piss 'd !
no receipt .
terrible customer service .
Neutral
awful customer service .
disgusting .
avoid at all costs .
going to be wearing this horror show around for quite a few weeks .
she makes eye contact with me then looks away !
its not busy yet it took awhile to receive just my black tea ... .
manager was polite and assisted with my short n simple order .
i wish starbucks would pay attention to yelp .
maybe time for management change turn it back around .
not sure what happened but it is n't good .
now , not much customers are here .
worst starbucks ever .
ridiculous !
not today , however .
wish u had other options around here for expensive coffee .
when i got to the window , she gave me hot mocha !
taking my business somewhere else .
management is a complete joke .
do not consider this place !
go somewhere else !
always wait to see the unit before signing .
stayed for _num_ months , bought a house .
avoid at all costs .
we quickly made our decision .
it 's not worth it .
so today me and my husband are looking for a place .
this place is over priced for the facility amenities and service you 'll receive .
disappointed .
now , this was said with a major attitude .
i mean it 's a wait and i am the only employee here !
i accidentally left some items in the truck .
of course ... but not the point .
it 's pretty ridiculous .
as always .
late night there is a problem .
tonight was cash only .
which is the 3rd time this has happened to me at this location .
not caring about service because they have you addicted .
the service person rang me up for a small soda .
but she said nothing .
sucks .
parking is awful too !
she said that walmart does n't sell phone cards .
not my normal location .
i went in by myself to get it done , they were very friendly .
very poor service .
manger , then manager told me to beat it .
after he walked away from me .
it 's always cheap place to shop .
baby food which is cheaper here than at an organic market .
anyways , i have n't been at walmart in ages .
bad mistake .
on may 8th i went inside to pickup my prescription .
this store needs major work , not in its appearance but in its service .
unbelievable .
this is just an fyi .
below wal-mart standards .
but here in vegas , walmart is a typical place to go ?
my main gripe about this place is that it is humongous .
little did she know who she was dealing with .
does n't have any manners .
never will i be back .
not even for store credit .
so you will get turned away .
ill give her and the kitchen _num_ stars .
this place is terrible !
horrible .
horrible .
the food was average , nothing over the top .
nothing sized medium ) .
your fairways are thin with grass and mostly made of mud .
not really but ok .
then he tried to charge me $ _num_ .
at least in the front _num_ .
recently they had a management change .
take your wedges because it is generally driver , short iron wedge type course .
horrible customer service ... .
totally changed my perspective on this golf course .
terrible service .
play here _num_ days a week for past two years .
lost customer service appeal .
service is hit or miss .
disgusting .
i get my order and `` the entire store is out of bread '' .
my _num_ year old son compared the cinnamon roll to the one at school .
clark county school district cinnamon rolls taste the same as yours ?
i will never be back .
by the time i get home i noticed the bag was wet and dripping .
i guess it 's just a hit or miss coming to this location .
crazy how busy this location was for a tuesday afternoon .
its basic safe ground for your picky eaters .
we ordered two soups , bread , mac n cheese , and two cookies .
what a disappointment .
it was really bad !
so the week following , i placed a smaller lunch order for my crew .
they ca n't find the order , and said they never received it .
ordered an asian sesame chicken salad to go .
never again , panera .
food not good ... .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the sandwich was cold .
just let down after let down .
ripoff !
are you kidding me ?
what a disappointment !
i also ordered two side chicken egg rolls .
i was disappointed .
my lasagna was incredibly dry .
nothing special .
payment being due at time of pick up .
: ( ugh !
located on tropicana and fort apache , behind mcdonald 's .
very rude .
terrible !
poor service .
she blended one side of my beard into my hair but not the other .
doors are thin and get holes easily .
would not recommend .
the management is horrible .
nothing is ever organized .
i said yes , and he was like whats my apt .
bad idea !
the `` staff '' seem dangerous .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
people do n't care .
requested several things to fixed nothing yet .
nearly half of the prime rib my boyfriend ordered was fat .
then came the entrees , which were less impressive .
i ate about _num_ oz worth before setting it aside .
merlot is all that i remember .
too bad .
she said she would be back .
so my boyfriend and i went to las vegas for vacation .
i called to make reservations , and we were set .
our bill was $ _num_ .
so unprofessional and rude .
in fact , santa monica city college is better than unlv .
i suggest getting an online degree over unlv .
`` , and then he says , `` chinese huh .
and hockey does not exist .
except for _num_ weeks in february .
also , the instructors have been told to not accept scratch paper .
the only competent instructor i have for fall _num_ is my chinese _num_ teacher .
it was absolute shit .
i left unlv after a couple of years .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
idk how .
bring some dry food , in containers .
the only quiet people are the foreign students .
they are dead on !
mind you , its _num_ degrees outside ; i head in that direction .
very irritating .
seriously , the prices are almost twice what they should be .
poor business practice !
they turned it into deep fried beef jerky .
terrible .
it was terrible .
place is run down .
it came with fried shrimp , an eggroll and some cream cheese rangoons .
the ginger onion beef was a little bit better but not by much .
it had more green onion and strips of ginger than there was beef .
it did not taste fresh .
i ordered the szechuan chicken lunch special with fried rice .
got mongolian beef w fried rice and two egg rolls today .
the mongolian beef was really mongolian onions and peppers .
especially for $ _num_ .
i will not be going back .
there was no sauce .
for some reason people really ca n't drive over here .
i get a text message saying my prescription is ready for pick up .
i went to this place last saturday after reading all the great reviews .
there are never enough registers open .
there `` _num_ 's a crowd '' is bs .
poor service .
poor service .
inappropriate employees .
terrible customer service .
long lines and slow .
it was all sauce , rice and beans .
had the enchilada tour , and they were the best i ever ate .
i miss not being able to get queso and tamales .
this place is horrible .
this place is horrible .
left after _num_ min .
salons should at least have _num_ stylists especially on weekends .
we will not be going back .
i was disappointed .
it certainly was n't fresh bacon .
when the food came out , the plate of chicken tenders was huge .
the flatbread was cold and hard .
not worth a penny .
super lame .
service was horrible .
it was just ok .
bad cooking skills .
afraid to eat it , i drove all the way back .
it was gross .
thanks for trying though .
staff is rude .
i had a beer which was good but hard to screw that up .
it looked way too dark .
it was straight dark rum and a splash of pineapple .
wo n't be back .
so i finally put a _num_ into a machine .
it was the only way to get someone to do anything .
fail .
be sure to check your bill .
i like to be in charge of how much i tip .
this place is like a cave .
filter broke in february _num_ .
about _num_ weeks prior , i get worried .
_num_ stars if possible .
worse place ever !
i showed up just before my appointment time and was greeted by the receptionist .
i could n't believe this .
am i high maintenance ?
obviously they do not care .
my point is , do i understand that things happen ?
pathetic .
worst haircut ever .
not picky but you do have to listen to the customer .
i do n't remember ... a while back .
... it 's not always the cleanest either .
and this is why i rarely eat fast food .
, she calls out for a chocolate shake , too .
seems high to me .
which i have n't eaten in probably _num_ years and regretted it then .
it 's so gross !
it 's a gas station mcdonald 's !
lame .
and afterward , i want to gas up my car , yup !
_num_ r e al z .
will not visit this location again !
gas light on !
advice to management , teach your employees stress management .
they cost me more money in repairs .
received _num_ beers on play .
( _num_ ) or original play .
we have never been treated like that before .
nothing `` dive bar '' about this place .
none of that here .
it kind of remind me of being home .
total bill $ _num_ .
its now two days later and the gel is off .
he put the gel over my cuticles !
ridiculous !
i highly doubt ill b back .
i assume she was on commission .
then a couple of weeks ago , i got a call asking for money .
and i hate saying that .
why so bad ?
terrible services .
not quite sure how it could be improved .
it kind of brings dirt cheap to a whole new meaning for me .
we did n't finish our meals .
it was so bland .
therefore , we were glad that we have this place .
they know how to under cook and burn potatoes at the same time .
cheap , yes .
i ordered an omelet with toast and hashbrowns .
confusing .
there was _num_ of us .
it was awful .
terrible service , terrible food .
i have bought appliances here several times .
no show , no call .
but the service was what really left an impression on us .
no real atmosphere here .
on a scale of 1-10 i give my bloody mary a _num_ .
you 're usual run of the mill , musty smelling bar .
i admit , i am a somewhat `` particular '' customer .
my second sandwich had american cheese and swiss cheese on it .
my wife and i showed up at 5:30 for dinner before a 7:00 movie .
yet it was a _num_ $ dinner .
the server was terrible .
after a recent visit , it looks like ownership has changed .
i was not overly impressed .
so i can not say what the food is like .
in that case , i 'd stick to beer .
total dive bar , pretty smokey , pool tables in the back .
got a meatball sub and fries for take out .
the seafood calzone had more bread and grease then actual meat .
no more from me .
we 've been ordering from here for at least five years .
there are so many better places in the area , especially bloomfield .
gross !
for some reason , my boyfriend decided to order from them tonight .
added _num_ toppings to the calzone ( pepperoni , mushrooms , broccoli ) .
no toppings !
literally just sauce and cheese .
so for now , i 'm going with _num_ .
ok , whatever .
it really made me wonder if they ever think about fire codes .
and finally , only in pa , you can still smoke in here .
it 's still miserable !
terrible food and service .
some definite problems as a venue .
often difficult to see the stage .
what a disaster .
: ) let 's start with atm 's , you wan na use one ?
hell to the no !
it 's awful here !
_num_ .
_num_ .
no no no .
so you ca n't sit at those tables .
these hot dogs , like so many before them taste exactly like hot dogs .
truly bad food .
the ambiance was sad .
they could do so much better .
the service was just ok .
the food was awful .
do n't get fooled .
head over to the bloomfield bridge tavern if you want some good pierogies .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the food is overpriced without a quality to back the price tag .
if you have to eat here , try one of the pizzas .
vegetarians have limited choices here .
_num_ .
skip the regular menu .
my friend 's english department had a small get together here .
it sorta is strange but get over it .
go there for the weird factor and less on the food and drinks .
not a fan .
it 's cafeteria food served on nice plates .
proceed with caution !
no more .
so sad .
even on a very crowded saturday night when the place was absolutely packed .
the soup was tasteless .
the bison rib-eye was all gristle .
no difference !
a shame .
the only beer here worth your time is the seasonal xmas ale .
horrible .
even my boyfriend brought up that he was short .
it lacked anything special .
ok ... i 'm being mean .
food however very disappointing .
their beer is awful .
get a better brew master , seriously .
very patronizing , to the point where i almost said something .
my first mistake .
first off , this two star rating is due to the food and service .
but we 're in pittsburgh and by default , good beers are expected .
anywho ... rant over .
the portions were huge , however .
my husband and i still looked forward to the bread pudding for dessert .
the ambiance is better than the food or beer and it is quite expensive .
tonight i had the meatloaf .
my husband 's lobster bisque was good , but again , very small portion .
so disappointing !
want to dip your fries in my chipotle ketchup ( # _num_ ) ?
the fillings were n't great either .
my entree was the mussels , which were cooked in beer .
the place gets very loud and the seating is cramped .
ventilation system needs to be improved .
just nothing that exciting .
i 'm not a beer person so this is mainly food related .
came here for beer and to taste the wood fired pizza .
it was drowning in grease .
this is basic food service stuff , folks .
nothing i would ever order again .
the service was terrible .
the menus are awful .
the food was mediocre .
the german potato salad was decent , and the soup was alright .
wasted potential .
most overrated place in pittsburgh , in my opinion .
their beer is nothing special .
neither is their food .
our drinks were refilled as he handed out the checks .
the jambalaya was not very impressive .
wait staff seemed disinterested .
i give this place _num_ stars for the really cool building and the beer .
the food , horrible !
no taste at all .
alas , no .
the appetizer we ordered was the lettuce wraps and it was fine .
beer is a _num_ , food is a 1-2 star .
`` oh , i thought someone already helped you '' , they responded .
we ordered appetizers , bruschetta and a lentil mushroom ball .
a+ for decor and ambience .
i 'm a big belgian beer fan but both really needed some love .
really missed the mark .
the food is okay , but overpriced for what it is .
granted , i 'm from nyc .
so i asked the waitress about the quinoa salad at church brew .
the quinoa was unbelievable .
it tasted like old refrigerator .
oh god , this place .
$ _num_ bucks for lunch for _num_ .
gross .
would not recommend .
they were very obviously looking to do as little work as possible .
three under cabinet light boxes installed and the switch on an exhaust fan replaced .
this place was horrible .
piece of fried fish on a plain bun , that 's it !
no sauce , no condiments .
lame .
had my car repaired here due to someone hitting my front driver side .
pathetic .
underwhelmed is how i would sum up my experience .
i went straight to washington blvd carwash and completed the interior myself .
avoid this place !
i purchased a gift card for a detailed auto wash .
so i needed to get my toes done last minute .
originally i was going to wear tennis shoes but then decided on open toe .
so , i didnt really think much of it at the time .
it ate away at my big toe !
did n't even get a massage .
no thanks .
terrible pedicure !
u go in with dry heels and leave the same way .
i could have done my own pedi for that matter .
it was really bad .
my gel polish lasted one day one before it chipped .
Positive
i struggled to read the last two lines of letters on the chart .
really can not recommend .
the onion soup is not a french onion soup .
kudos to piper 's pub for doing something different .
service was slow .
it was extremely loud inside .
i had my family with me and they ordered fried zucchini for an appetizer .
and my younger niece she ordered chicken fingers with fries .
what awful customer service !
the absolute worst .
it was shockingly bad .
terrible service !
only go if desperate for food and or hungover .
no , thanks .
completely ruins the bagel .
that should not be necessary .
which it typically is not .
eventually i just stopped going .
it really is n't .
garbage !
what horrible customer service !
disgusting .
i added three packs of soy sauce to make it taste like something .
this place has shockingly expensive drinks for an establishment that looks divey .
and it 's really not .
do n't expect dive bar prices , or that friendly dive bar service .
this place is horrible !
which this dump most definitely is not .
as well , it 's nearly impossible to get a drink from the bartenders .
but it fails to work here .
then they hit total strangers up for a drink .
fail !
this place is terrible .
he literally had to reach in his pocket for a napkin .
not the amazingly friendly service the sign describes .
extremely rude staff .
and the wait to get drinks can be pretty freaking long too .
this place is awful .
it screams trash .
ok i get it you are busy .
but you are going to make a grand tonight so suck it up cupcake .
my biggest complaint however was the clientele .
lots of wood and stained glass .
all in all this place is a passable bar prior to about _num_ pm .
not a fan .
bad service .
place was busy for a sunday night filled with young college students .
the whole place smells like old man cigar smoke , fish , and feet .
nothing special .
the sushi was about the same quality that i get at giant eagle .
this is where it all ends and goes south though .
at peak dinner hours , you literally have to fight your way through everything .
nakama is not the place .
ick -- avoid this place .
still nothing in front of me .
also , my bartender made me taste the sake before giving it to me .
ca n't verify that though .
it was pretty packed and indeed , it was very loud and very dark .
it was really bad .
it 's also really loud in the restaurant .
the manager apologized and went to grab a chef for us .
and then they would get one chance .
bartender was rude .
soup was way too salty .
service was horrible .
had to pass all used dishes to the waitress across the grill .
will not hurry back .
the sushi was your average run of the mill raw fish .
ick !
our drinks were always full and the service was spectacular .
the place as also very loud .
because people are clueless .
i have tried nakama 's _num_ times to be fair .
ridiculous .
the rice was decent , the sauce on the meals was just average .
sushi is inconsistent .
no booze .
shrimp tempura was beer batter , not tempura .
it 's just a buttery fried rice fest in your mouth .
what is so hard about bringing me a lemon with my water ?
i 've experienced better .
we could n't even eat together .
little tokyo in mt .
ca n't say that about a lot of sushi restaurants .
i 'm probably going to go ahead and split this up into sections .
the chefs are similar to what you will get any hibachi place .
fried rice seemed bulk and not freshly made .
very busy at lunch .
slow service , mediocre food .
however , the food has yet to come .
it is extremely loud which i expected , but didnt help the experience .
overall , it was a decent meal but i dont think we would return .
had the hibachi sesame chicken , my husband had the hibachi steak .
it was bad .
spend your money elsewhere .
customer and frequent lover of nakama for over _num_ yrs now .
the restaurant is way over-priced and the food is just `` average '' .
this was my least favorite experience at nakama .
.
i will probably only go there now for the sushi as a takeout item .
my son ordered shrimp hibachi i ordered chicken fried rice .
throw it away and put a xmas beer there .
she was rude and ignorant !
just plain mean .
zero management i guess .
after this time , never to come back again .
Neutral
had a reservation for _num_ last friday .
this was my first and last nakama experience .
service was not so good .
valet returned car keys because they were going to leave early .
or lack there of .
visited michael 's pizza bar mid june _num_ with a friend .
we sat at the bar and were quickly helped .
after some people cleared out , i was able to get a little service .
i dread coming to this starbucks .
carson street is very busy , and it 's hard to park .
unacceptable !
below my eyebrows ?
he estimated $ _num_ , can have it back to me in a day .
worst bar ever !
cheesy island decor .
anyway , tiki lounge really does cater directly to that craving .
the woman just opens a corona ( regular ) and does n't say anything .
ok weird , but we can get over it .
drinks were cheap .
the other bartenders were friendly which goes a long way .
just play it safe and get a beer or something .
in fact ordering it was a pretty big pain in the ass .
dear lord , it was crowded .
i really like tiki bars and was excited to go here .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
thick was not very busy .
no luck .
guess where i 'm headed next ?
we sat down , ordered coffee and drinks , and then waited .
i 'm not kidding .
i had a veggie hoagie and cheese fries .
it is dirt cheap and if they had veggie alternatives i would definitely return .
no big deal .
will never return here .
an extreme amount of cigarette smoke in the air .
disgusting .
not sure about now .
the crowd was mainly regulars , the drinks were cheap .
this was my home away from home for a while .
but the phone call i just experienced would suggest otherwise .
even new york pizza is n't considered true italian .
sausage between the layers of dough ?
basically a chicago style pizza is a quiche , minus the eggs of course .
i ordered a small chicago style pizza .
mediocre at best .
the pizza came and the crust was anything but , more like bread .
terrible customer service .
beyond ridiculous .
happened on a fri around _num_ am .
it was unbelievable .
got the ultra huge _num_ slice cheese pizza .
disappointed .
the spinach topping is just bagged frozen spinach for a whole $ _num_ extra .
for my choice of side i went with fries .
never received any communication regarding upcoming events , classes , discounts etc .
the wine was bland .
this is going to be short .
awful place .
disgusting .
the food was rather quick to come to the table and looked very good .
as i normally do , i tried the meat and the sauce separately .
trying to find that balance , i began adding the sauce to the gyro .
with each bite , i had to add more sauce .
they were also piping hot and made to order .
their gyros are over priced , and are the size of samples .
i waited on forever and i only ordered one gyro .
think of those microwave pretzels you get from sam 's or costco .
am i missing something ?
occasionally , co-workers pick-up the `` cheese '' sauce .
nothing special .
pathetic !
relatively bad .
it 's not a very professional atmosphere .
i only kept going there because i had a package .
not the cleanest .
prices are very inexpensive .
they would n't serve me .
our bad .
if they are different , i 'll happily try this place again .
i 'm not exaggerating .
it gets worse .
this was our 1st stop .
this is a pet peeve of mine .
it 's gets very , very stuffy in there .
friday night _num_ 's dance party .
_num_ pbr drafts until 11pm so we only had a couple special drinks .
completely different from what i 've read or expected .
place looked awesome .
prices high , food great , but i ca n't afford this .
gross !
ok place for a lunchtime burger or breakfast .
i just wish the food had been as good .
$ _num_ maybe .
my wife ordered chicken and prosciutto with pasta .
disappointed .
the worst part ?
horrible treatment .
mediocre wine overpriced .
wish dish were open for lunch .
`` , as loud as he possibly could .
the breakfast menu was way smaller than anticipated .
there was definitely some crusty stuff on the rim of my coffee mug .
i got the chicken parm over pasta .
_num_ stars from some ?
my god , the cakes were delicious .
i could have had nothing but cake for brunch that day .
sit down with others at one table .
i believe that their menu is _num_ % vegetarian .
not a fan .
crusty .
sloppy .
quick give me a real egg and meat !
is the food vegan ?
disgusting .
that being said , the atmosphere is awesome as is the store .
the atmosphere is awesome , i will give them that .
the food was mediocre .
they did n't have to-go boxes !
over all this place had a chaotic vibe to it .
would not recommend to a friend .
they charge hefty fees without telling you anything .
if you 're craving burger king , go else where .
i would n't step foot in this place .
the food is typical burger king fare but definately get a to go bag .
i then requested barbeque .
i also noticed that the cheese slices on the floor were still there .
it was heavily stained with grease and pop .
`` chicken nuggets and french fries , '' i thought to myself .
my mother used to get ones just like it at costco .
the chicken nuggets came out .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
the hamburger was correct , i 'll give them that .
the fries were cold .
says they closed at _num_ that night .
_num_ stars .
why are thrift stores becoming so expensive !
i like the ring enough . ''
_num_ .
the oil was ... vegetable oil with salt & pepper .
sucks .
it 's diner food not gourmet a la carte .
i went in with very low expectations .
the gyro and the hot roast beef sandwich arrived .
and it stayed dry -- for a long time .
i might return if someone really wants to go .
i realize that this is one of those southside staples .
eggs , toast , meats , and potatoes .
yeah , the kids ai n't lying , this place blows .
only good for people watching .
i stayed here recently for a work trip .
reservations and payment : i booked a group of _num_ rooms for four days .
needless to say , i 've not hear back from them .

parking is not included in ur room .
i dont think id stay here again bc of the parking .
but , not so quiet .
that 's not all folks !
dirty and rude staff .
ugh .
do you want to sleep ?
too bad .
empty parking lot .
empty lobby .
disgusting .
shuttle that rarely is running on time .
my hands were full so they said they would send someone up .
no apology .
worst hotel experience ever .
it was disgusting .
gross .
there was no apology .
southside deserves a better grocery store .
i miss this place .
disgusting .
zero stars .
owner is extremely rude .
this ca n't be serious .
mostly light meal oriented w/ panini and sandwiches .
cold service .
wifi is n't free , so get that out of your mind .
there are other coffee shops in the south side that offer a better experience .
avoid .
not turned down , off .
at least five other tables cleared out almost immediately .
but , next time i 'm in the southside i 'm going to starbucks .
are you kidding me ?
this is where i promptly sat down to write this review .
the remaining room is very long and narrow , and feels crowded .
avoid !
this place sucks .
so rude !
this store has too much packed in to a too tiny space .
that was maybe six inches tall and a foot across .
what a shame ... .
no .
just , no .
are you kidding me ?
i can assume they were on par with other used movie places .
i just was n't wowed .
hey , everyone was doing it .
just do n't go to hot rod .
the place itself , is n't anything fancy or nice .
terrible terrible customer service .
it was really bad .
they always seem like it is an inconvenience that you are there .
i heard great things about the fish sandwich .
the atmosphere is not cheery .
normally they are priced higher than your average grocery store .
that 's ridiculous !
like _num_ people inside .
and only for us he gave beers in plastic cups .
it 's a hit or miss here .
the mac and cheese bites were good .
the wings were also cold .
update ; the bartender confirmed the wings are from restaurant depot .
i 'm in food and beverage and something needs to be resolved .
dumpy and old .
the raised the rate on me just before i arrived .
Neutral
i stay at this hampton inn green tree every month ( on average ) .
_num_ . )
i hate this set-up .
this place is horrible !
it is a `` hole in the wall '' .
when i tried it once last year , i was pleased .
broccoli was too mushy .
suffering !
the only other decent items were the chicken soup and wonton soup .
not good .
too expensive for portion size .
the cashew chicken should be so much better .
i dunno .
the food came much faster than i expected , which was great .
i ordered the house fried rice and the beef stick app .
bland and flavorless food .
i ordered the wonton soup and moo goo gai pan .
pretty disappointing and overpriced .
food is all the same deep fried chicken with different sauces .
i had it replaced by goodyear before we drove back to pa .
they replaced the entire thing under warranty .
the food was not that great .
if i went again , i would stick with just the fried food .
are you kidding me ?
believe me , i 've not just been there a couple of times .
cole slaw was bland .
delivery driver delivered pizza and we tipped in cash .
this company made it _num_ times more stressful than i anticipated .
really bad experience .
super annoying and frustrating experience .
oh my ... dont like the food here .
rude !
it took nearly a half hour to get my takeout .
it was listed as open on yelp !
this place is horrible .
pretty nasty customer service .
doesnt anyone know what pete 's wicked ale is ?
we get here and it 's confusing from the start .
she walks off .
someone else comes over and puts down two pepsi glasses .
we 've done it before and it 's worked .
i get the chicken sandwich , he gets the roast beef au jus .
the service was worse .
a little while later our soup came in cups .
still no soup !
never again big jim , never again !
actually , more like a _num_ .
my husband and i split the chicken parm hoagie ... good , not great .
however our little one ordered buttered noodles and was pleased as punch .
remember , i was here for lunch and they just opened .
i had an italian hoagie and my wife had a salad .
from the front cash register to the pictures in the back dining area .
fried zucchini was really greasy and the marinara was in a plastic cup .
i know it 's not fine dining but that was never done .
this hurts my heart it write this review .
went to visit u of pittsburgh with the college bound son .
out of the way , hard to find , at night .
inside to the left is a dinning room that we walked into .
before we sat i checked the bar side and it was better .
not good but much better .
he was not happy .
_num_ out of _num_ .
i ordered a bowl of wedding soup and half of a meatball hoagie .
disappointing reuben sandwich .
my husband and i shop at giant eagle at least once a week .
if only the self check out machine would stop breaking down .
it feels cramped inside .
this pizza tastes like pizza .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
`` $ _num_ plus tip please . ''
the vets and vet staff were adequate .
we would strongly recommend east end vet .
no call back .
the drink was overpriced , but whatever .
ridiculous .
the pizza was terrible .
as far as an italian sub that 's a little hard to screw up .
but this location ca n't compare to the others i 've been to .
dirty men 's room .
unsure of who our server was .
noisy .
there are better options .
the eggs were hard and over cooked .
the only entree that was decent were the hotcakes .
the food is completely ordinary and completely overpriced .
i had a turkey club sandwich for ~ $ _num_ .
the sandwich was ok , nothing special .
my child got a chicken sandwich for ~ $ _num_ .
for $ _num_ .
from what i 've experienced , he seems very sketchy .
it was quite strange .
$ _num_ round trip for _num_ .
lady at payment window says `` exact payment . ''
very poorly managed .
i 'm not surprised that the operator at the bottom does n't touch money .
if you 're not with the program , you 're an idiot .
i 've checked off my things to do list and will now move on .
i was disappointed .
terrible customer service .
such rudeness and racist is unacceptable .
no second time .
this is ridiculous .
bad , bad , bad experience .
ridiculous !
the employees were not welcoming .
washington we looked for places to eat and most of them were closed .
- parking will cost you .
nothing short of diner fare .
terrible food .
so i opted for sausage gravy and biscuits .
so i ordered the seafood bisque .
instead we received a choice of fruit or chicken noodle soup .
the main courses we chose were the filet with mushrooms and the ocean platter .
the lobster tail was cooked correctly , being the single item prepared as expected .
i remember the tin angel of the 80s and 90s .
bar is not well stocked .
the soup and fruit starters were above average .
_num_ years ago , this may have been a great restaurant .
my husband and i decided to stop in after looking at their menu online .
i really need to know a time to call the owner directly . ''
this place is a rough one to hang out in .
this place is your average hole in the wall dive bar .
they refused .
this business is not deserving of your business .
absolutely horrible service !
i do not recommend !
the absolute worst !
it 's too big . ''
nothing to write home about !
awful attitude .
should n't be in business !
again , just bizarre .
also , there is n't anywhere to sit inside the ice cream shop .
decided to stay in friday night and order some pizza .
the pizza is just ok .
i would n't recommend it .
the walls are either prison gray or white tile with literally nothing on them .
if you want a quality steak you better head to longhorn .
the dining room could use some wall decor .
washington restaurants i know .
even the menu is confusing .
the menu was also small - perhaps only 15-20 total choices ?
it is not .
so flash forward _num_ hours .
how much did this _num_ oz .
i am thinking i need to come back and try the bar .
the fish was mediocre .
nothing special .
unacceptable .
also , the owner is a total snob .
they offer outdoor seating , which is a plus .
was traveling to pittsburgh and decided to grab a bite before the baseball game .
would never return here .
service was poor .
not a repeat visit .
mushy wings .
incredibly slow service .
so i 've never been a fan .
washington because the wait at all the surrounding restaurants was insane .
first , the fajita only comes with steak and peppers .
i noticed someone with a chicken wrap and it was huge .
racist staff !
bad bad bad bad bad !
so bad !
service was very slow .
the burger came with onion straws , bacon , cheese and burger patty .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it 's very respectful of you .
i 'm not kidding .
i 've even got my father coming to the harris for bacon night .
not so much .
why only _num_ stars ?
food was horrible .
fries were spicy , everything was made spicy .
however it does n't describe the food very well .
out of that too .
nonetheless , i ordered a turkey burger and he ordered a mushroom burger .
he should be running the place , really .
they are still _num_ star and live up to my expectations .
the service was terrible .
thumbs down .
i 'll not return any time soon .
i was here around 2:30 on a monday .
today our friend suggested it so _num_ of us went out together .
but a party of _num_ ?
it actually hurt my lips and stomach .
i really wanted to like this place .
sad experience .
for a `` _num_ star '' rating , i 'd expect better .
the hostess was just cold as ice .
night ruined !
my husband ordered a _num_ vintage red from the wine list .
what our server brought was a _num_ .
not disappointed , either .
went here for a business dinner tonight .
the second time i went , my salad had a hair in it .
i 've never made reservations for the dining room .
he apologized and cleared the table and sent our waitress over .
not even under a heat lamp cold .
it was just cold .
and fish is not very tasty cold .
fake painted palm trees ?
( lets not forget about the elevator ride ) .
even the butter for the bread was salted almost too much !
again , disappointing .
chilean seabass with korean bbq preparation .
when i think seabass i think flaky , buttery tasting fish .
but it didnt taste like anything special , especially for $ _num_ .
nothing special .
regardless , i just ca n't recommend you eat here .
sad times all around .
the food is okay but very expensive .
no caring whatsoever .
there 's nothing hanging on the walls .
i was very disappointed .
now , there is a table wait list .
the remodel is grey , drab .
nice ambiance and view , but their cooking fell short .
our waitress was arrogant .
dry salty just disgusting .
i ate garbage .
i would stick to the chilean sea bass .
do n't bother .
really , really disappointing .
the veal was so overpowered with garlic !
i like a little garlic but this was overwhelming !
i will not go back !
i 'm not making this up !
spinach salad with hot bacon dressing had cold bacon dressing .
they are only getting _num_ stars because of the view .
i have been here once before and it seemed okay .
i am taking my husband here for his birthday tonight strictly for the view .
do n't even bother !
essentially , this place is making money because of the view .
you 'll get the same view , better food and better service .
but we never got to find out .
bad service .
food is mediocre .
service is mediocre .
such a shame .
terrible terrible service !
service was soooo slow .
baked potato was microwaved .
this is a direct result of the baking .
the tip was n't much .
the interior is weird .
the baked potato was also dense .
the food is crappy .
cheap food prepared poorly .
i think i 've experienced better flavor at taco bell .
can everyone in this establishment just get on the same page ?
the baked potato was over cooked .
i was so wrong .
the waiter never mentioned the price of the specials .
needless to say , he left hungry .
i assume that maybe just meant a long wait for food .
bread ... brought it out , i was late .
gross .
false .
i dunno , i expected flavor .
it was very blah .
maybe i like things too flavorful ?
not a family / kid friendly place .
would not recommend this place .
i was quite satisfied with it but it was still too much for me .
pathetic .
olive garden has better food .
meal was very disappointing .
it was not good .
i was just very underwhelmed .
no exaggeration .
the calamari was very chewy although the flavor was good .
ambiance was terrible .
i got my penne in vodka sauce which was so incredibly salty .
food was terrible .
not fresh , not good .
we ordered food here as we walked around the area .
i got it a _num_ this time and it was hotter than before .
i ordered the vegetable fried rice for the take out meal .
the waiter ( owner , chef ? )
horrible customer service !
it 's not .
this place is not good .
maybe next time i 'll get the italian sub as it looked good .
not a good scene .
sadly ... .
)
if you 're not a regular , then you will be made to wait .
this is very unprofessional .
fact : a business is responsible for what it 's staff does and says .
if possible , i 'd like to resolve this over the phone .
unacceptable .
horrible hotel .
this is what i get for letting other people book my hotel reservation .
it was awful .
the rooms all come with a microwave , stove and a fridge .
the main problem with it is that it is so noisy .
screaming children , people walking around upstairs at all hours .
windows do n't seal so any noise from the outside comes in .
the room was very hot and stuffy .
furniture was ripped and torn .
ca n't be sanitary .
_num_ .
sure this will not matter .
i 've only been here on nights during the school year and -- yikes .
poor service .
very crowded even on a weekday in the summer time .
not personable , not nice .
go for drinks , pass on the food .
not happy with management decisions .
she was rude and racist .
carpet , in a bar , even in the dining room ... questionable .
this is a difficult review to write .
i wish the museum was far better .
you ca n't please everyone .
garbage is always overflowing .
ridiculous .
they put tomato sauce on it ?
i guess the pitt students like it for the price and convenient location .
the drinks are pretty standard cocktails , but not particularly strong or reasonably priced .
i 've tried their pizza which is ok .
i usually get the spaghetti and meatballs which is a half pound meat ball .
you could at least put like _num_ half pound meatballs on my plate .
went for lunch again for a meeting .
fucking disgusting .
everything here is kind of so-so .
nothing special .
extremely mediocre .
i am so confused .
definitely cheap though .
the coupon also said that they offered toppings for $ _num_ .
pathetic .
a bunch of clowns sitting in an office with their thumbs in their ears .
and they still kept $ _num_ of my promised $ _num_ return .
rental car agent : i think i know why we have reservations .
horrible !
i do n't smoke and i have a one year old .
this is the second time i 've rented from enterprise @ this pittsburgh location .
i did call after reviewing the emailed receipt , and the charges were removed .
it was weird .
i am sure where they were and am sure they were stolen .
rip off .
we reserved _num_ beds and got _num_ bed .
sushi rolls fell apart .
i can get a salmon roll and an avocado roll for about $ _num_ .
_num_ ) i am meeting a friend for lunch on campus .
the rolls were flavorless .
but recently , you 've changed .
racist racist racist .
gross .
rude and arrogant .
disappointing ... .
that 's a tough one and a half mile stretch of road .
_num_ hours for cold pizza .
so rude .
in a pinch , but i 've had much better asian food .
i 'm with matt l. on this one .
the kim chi is subpar .
some people do n't like taro chunks in theirs .
it was disgusting .
however not in this case .
big mistake .
i ordered the bbq pork noodle bowl , and bob the boyfriend ordered ramen .
hold out for rose tea or anything , really -- anything else .
i always wonder why every chinese eateries has singapore rice noodles on their menu ?
it 's so horrible .
lulu 's really not fantastic .
big portions , pretty fast .
everyone who works here has soo much attitude its beyond belief .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
yuck , yuck , yuck .
it was not good .
all in all , it was way off the mark .
their pho is terrible .
tried lulu 's again .
gross .
i tried the pan fried crispy noodles with chicken and the pad thai .
both were disgusting !
meat seemed low quality .
the soup was tasteless .
cafeteria korean , thai , and chinese culinary low end .
there is ample seating which was nice so we sat immediately .
the food is cheap and passable .
fishy !
me and my doctor girlfriend ?
but , it was totally meh .
and , the basil dish was spicy but not all that flavorful .
sorry , lulu 's .
i would n't go back .
first the bad .
i ordered the korean bibimbap bowl with duck .
the bowl was topped with kimchi and duck .
too much rice .
maybe next time i 'll just get mango smoothies and onion pancakes .
terrible food !
overall , the food is just questionable .
the tofu was mushy .
the one plus side is that this place is really , really cheap .
one of my friends told that the pad thai here is her absolute favorite .
firstly , it was really nothing like real pad thai .
i really want to like this place .
their brown sauce is heavy , like gravy .
i 've tried several of their dishes and only like one .
too speedy .
how wrong we were .
rude .
could use more bubbles though .
it 's cheap .
it is not suppose to taste sweet .
if this restaurant runs in china , c'mon , people will kill it .
fail .
i also put sriracha and and black vinegar on it .
the good thing about this place is that it 's cheap .
however , the pluses stop there .
they charge an average amount for some less than decent food .
their food was terrible .
_num_ stars for the food and _num_ for the service .
hello , where 's my waitress ?
the only tasty thing at lulu 's is the sriracha sauce .
it 's a shame .
bathroom is not to be used even in emergency situations .
so i came to get _num_ mango smoothie bubble tea today .
based on my past experience with other people there , i might come back .
i will not be returning .
really flavorless food .
so disappointing .
overall food was crappy .
avoid this place .
bad bad bad .
so disappointed .
i wish it was a little quicker and cleaner overall .
it just makes me wonder what passes as `` sanitary '' in their kitchen .
bad service !
food is bland !
my colleague ordered the pad thai and the balance of flavors were completely off .
wings and crab rangoon are crispy .
why am i here .
try rose tea or even oriental express .
- variety
it was mainly cheap rice noodles with sauce and green veggies .
the food is sub-par .
the prices have n't changed much in _num_ years .
i recently i went there and ordered the szechuan chicken noodle bowl .
horrible service .
it does n't exist .
staff all need to be trained asap if they want to stay in business .
nothing to write home about .
i guess its redeeming qualities were that it 's cheap and convenient .
extremely mediocre asian food .
it 's got chinese , japanese , thai , viet , etc .
ick .
server was friendly and assisted me in ordering .
i ordered thai lemon beef on noodles .
this was on a sunday night , in the summer ( i.e .
i ordered a mango & strawberry jasmine green tea boba with normal sweetness .
for $ _num_ , it is overpriced .
as for the entre , i had the dr. fu special .
the dish was mediocre .
also boba tea is nothing like boba but just some melted ice .
horrible .
ordered a noodle bowl two veggie egg rolls and tom yum soup .
tom yum soup just broth , with four or five floating mushroom slices .
have n't been here for quite awhile .
subpar asian food in an extremely noisy cafeteria setting .
the plus side of this restaurant is that it is fast and cheap .
there are many other asian restaurants near by for better price and quality !
-the food is mediocre .
if you want good food in the area , go to little asia .
not very impressed .
hyped up fast food chinese restaurant , american style .
we had a good run , but we 've grown apart .
i 've been loyal , but deserve better right now .
do not go here for alterations .
i don ' t think this is unreasonable .
excuse me ?
this place blows .
expect crowds , with loud loud music and lots of smoke .
no , really .
the drink selection itself is laughable .
some dude was passed out in a chair for a half hour .
service is horrible .
service is very slow .
bad service and bad food !
i have n't been here in awhile and made a stop in last night .
this was a dive bar , obviously catering to students .
it 's a shame .
avoid .
i seriously probably had this haircut in the 3rd grade .
but it is pricey ( for ice cream i mean ) .
horrible , rude service .
terrible .
my favorite is the mexican chocolate ( chocolate with a spicy bite ! )
for one , it is centrally located in `` university alley . ''
sometimes the crowds i see deter me from going in .
also , be careful with their spoons .
worst ice cream ever !
i went to this dealership in the hopes of purchasing _num_ cars .
there are other choices in this area .
i always walked by this place and wondered if i should try .
the only real attraction to this place is the student pricing .
dishes here are quite cheap .
for this price , you could get a lot better .
or ca n't slice the meat and cook it ?
not going back here again .
everything else i 've tried i have regretted ordering .
i stopped by for lunch with my family on a thursday .
the main reason i am rating this place two stars is their pitas .
we ended up ordering some dips and two meals , lamb and chicken kabobs .
just your ordinary cvs with everything bumped up in price due to convenience .
absolutely horrible experience .
if you run a restaurant you better be a little personable .
blah blah blah .
i did , however , get a new knife .
food is average .
this has been my choice indian restaurant for over a decade .
water was never refilled .
just no .
_num_ stars for water guy .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
( pool .
but it simply is n't .
nothing really stood out and , again , the food was really greasy .
go if you have midnight munchies and you want cheap food .
desert misses the rain .
we all flew up and out of the booth in reaction to this .
her reaction was slow .
avoid !
you need to have a drunken buzz to enjoy the food .
we were _num_ for _num_ on dinners .
i 'm not a fan .
my problem is the food .
it is just eh .
the waitress stole my credit card information .
the place was a typical sports bar , dimly lit .
i would 've preferred them plain .
really really disappointing .
how to describe awful ?
foul taste .
ugh .
one point off .
i rated a similar bar/restaurant combo in boston ( sunset grill and tap ) .
i spent _num_ hours there and my hair came out orange with red roots !
i 've never regretted something as much as going to that place .
this place is horrible .
not into mystery meat .
not going to this again .
- no breakfast sandwiches .
- bathroom requires a key ?
i guess that 's typical starbucks .
pretty crowded starbucks with the typical college crowd since it 's located in oakland .
horrible service !
neither did the wife .
not close to much else , but that 's okay too .
stayed at the hotel for _num_ night .
it was gross .
next time i 'm going to the mcdonald 's next door .
egg and bacon were heated up in a microwave .
worst experience ever .
i was very uncomfortable .
the service was slow .
not fresh at all .
the fact they say they make italian food is embarrassing .
but this place is n't italian .
service was terribly .
so slow .
they were very rude .
gross !
no thanks !
so i was really hoping the food would be amazing .
by _num_ in .
the service could also have been better .
this was a mistake .
ick .
the worst kfc ever .
very blah tasting crispy chicken to be honest .
)
i have been wanting to try this place for a long time .
staff was rude and disrespectful .
she said its the same chef , same squid , same way .
yesterday evening , hoping to get a soup to comfort me .
she went away and chatted in chinese with the nearby table .
that was effective in making me leave promptly .
i had never had such an experience at a restaurant in my life before .
miserable dinning experience .
lousy service !
no acknowledgement of received request .
they also cater for large parties in their upstairs dining area .
just plain unacceptable !
very poor dining service .
in hell .
that she works long hours and job ca n't complete on time .
you 've been warned .
i never got the soda and the pizza box was soaked in wing sauce .
it was handed to me like that !
could n't believe it .
this pizza hut is very hit and miss , but mostly miss .
the main problem is not enough sauce .
, this was a total let down .
all that cost me $ _num_ .
for a lunch special , it was quite expensive .
decent but terribly inconsistent food .
if i return , it will only be for the buffet .
so gross .
will not order from here again .
they have invited me back free of charge to give them a second try .
the chicken curry was good .
i would not go there again .
also , my two stars for this place is solely because of the desserts .
i tried the chicken curry , the chicken tikka masala , and some rice .
i am never ordering from this place again .
i chose the chicken tikka .
the chicken chunks were rather large , moist , and shredded well .
the tomato sauce is too sweet .
he has n't been there in over a year .
i ordered the roasted duck and the egg rolls .
food choices are very limited .
was expecting more for a chinese buffet .
however , there are other places that are better for chinese food .
however , i thought it was strange you pay first .
i will not be returning .
not really a large selection .
only few kinds of food you can eat in the buffet .
drinks usually suck .
rip , pgh cafe .
in fact i hate it .
lame .
i can guarantee that i ate it like a two year old kid .
it 's awkward .
this store is just , eh .
not because of the customers .
i am a long standing customer of cvs and have been for years .
no problem . ''
that whole entire situation was completely unnecessary !
the $ _num_ large cheese pizza .
no sorry .
no discount .
do n't expect a fantastic dining area either .
other qualities of the food included being too salty and too much sauce .
inedible general tso chicken .
fast , cheap ... for a reason .
this was one of the few restaurants that messed up chinese food .
will not come here again !
it 's so bad .
the tomato and vegetables like uncooked .
the food was awful .
drowned in oil and sauce .
you probably get what you pay for !
everything is either too greasy , drowning in sauce , or both .
i 've had the beef noodle soup , which is flavorful but greasy .
the second star is because they are quick and cheap .
the food is cheap for a reason .
food was tasteless .
both were bland .
did a rush job because there was an appointment coming in .
i saw , other customers getting foot massages , which i never got .
not worth it .
s & t is conveniently located in oakland .
my pedi was standard .
i 've never had to wait that long anywhere else before .
because this is not the one ... .
i will not be back .
she did one coat of polish over it and returned to her other client .
i 've been here twice now because sometimes you just want a burrito .
ick .
i ate here for the first time today .
being from california i have been spoiled when it comes to mexican food .
here , i ordered a steak burrito and a horchata .
i would n't go again .
but you specialize in bagels and coffee .
chipotle is the better option anyways for fast food mexican in oakland .
( i suspect this is a result of having a lower customer flow ) .
to be honest , i 've never had qdoba before this point .
first off , their burrito is equally as fat as chipotle 's .
the qdoba is sloppy .
how sloppy you ask ?
it 's more expensive than chipotle !
is n't that great .
i spoke to christine h , it director .
pure hell !
it was so not .
my complaint is the nursing staff .
they are rude .
you can claim all you want to the supervisor but nothing gets done .
it 's sad really .
since the management change , all the attentive and friendly wait staff is gone .
not impressed at all .
is n't that your job ?
just awful .
normally ahi tuna should come out red in the middle while cooked rare .
it was disappointing .
it was disappointing .
it seemed like there was corn syrup in it ( ! )
dessert was vanilla gelato .
the tow man was courteous and helpful .
that was n't the biggest problem .
i could n't believe it .
not these people .
terrible experience .
i would just have to call and they would send somebody down .
he said , `` yeah , just let me turn my truck around . ''
fast forward two weeks - i just returned from receiving my prepared tax documents .
ruined my transmission !
very slow service .
otherwise , avoid .
it was disgusting .
that was not so great .
chicken nachos , fried zucchini slices and waffle fries .
this was absolutely ridiculous !
very disappointing .
do you want to patronize a place like this ?
he left disgusted .
total scum bag .
so my friend ate fries for dinner .
the sales person was very helpful , to the point of being pushy .
you ca n't ever make a mattress more firm .
he said give the mattress a few days and the odor would go away .
the company did not care .
terrible quality .
that 's plain price shopping .
waiting for an explanation as to what we both saw , i received none .
it took a week to get the dresses back .
but no .
and of course i ended up with a giant black stain on my coat .
was $ _num_ .
i walk in and hand the guy my ticket .
what a ridiculous experience .
dh dropped off some pants for dry cleaning .
the pants were expensive ( for me ) and still pretty new .
not this place .
just threw it away .
i 'm sure it 's difficult to remember the details of every client complaint .
the instructions said take them off before wash , can you read english ?
extremely bad attitudes .
very disappointing .
i will not be returning .
do not use this cleaners !
you 've been warned !
how they get away with it is beyond me .
that place is absurd .
horrible !
maybe it gets better once you get there .
but no longer .
food just is n't good anymore .
every time , the place never provided great service .
the portions were quite small , and truly i 'm not amazed .
it 's just tea with powdered flavoring , with milk covering the overall taste .
it does not taste like tea .
boba tea is average , i 've had much better in california : ( .
this place is lame !
just grossed me out .
if you want to try something here , try the short rib with peppers .
however , if you come here be prepared for shitty customer service .
are n't we suppose to stick together or something ?
they mainly use powder and artificial bs .
the family that owns this place owns several restaurant around the area .
my gf and i went there for dinner last night .
did n't offer to seat us somewhere else .
service is bad .
totally will not go there again .
terrible place .
just no .
so gross !
also the food is a bit too salty , at least in my opinion .
i 've already done so for their sister shop pink box bakery cafe .
at least put some benches outside if you can not accommodate your customers .
f this place .
you walk into the cramped ( otherwise cozy ) restaurant .
the prices for the specials and bubble tea is very reasonable too .
he is just awful .
might not be back .
chicken curry .
not curry in any sense .
i 've been going to this giant eagle since i was a kid .
avoid .
if at all possible , use the self check outs .
still , there are problems .
for instance , there are never enough employees working at one time .
this is right down the street from where i live ...
they only had _num_ round ones .
books were stuffed under table legs to balance tables .
this was not the case .
i was truly embarrassed .
this is only part of this issue though .
i could have gotten the piece at michaels craft store for $ _num_ .
not great , its an ok pizza shop i guess .
however , what my mom received was completely different .
i will not use them again .
what a big mistake .
very unprofessional and rude !
yes -- there are probably a million records in that place ( really ) .
you 'll be disappointed .
the selection is terrible .
try the med grill a few blocks down .
meh .
i ordered the chicken salad , which i have had many times before .
the atmosphere really can make or break a dining experience .
everything was bad .
Positive
worst .
bad business practice .
horrible service and food .
the place sucks .
the tables are so sticky , i felt like i 'd catch a disease .
what the hell ?
and timing is entirely random .
update ... apparently jr has standards .
i was excited to get pizza here .
i decide to go pick it up anyways .
the box was not even warm .
and offended !
worst chinese food ever .
overly greasy chinese take out .
i also added on an egg roll and a _num_ oz dr pepper .
this restaurant totally sucks .
bad food and bad service .
i can cook much better szechuan dish at home .
disappointed ... .
i then ordered the dumplings .
a long wait later she brought out pork dumplings .
the service was terrible .
we were so excited about trying chinese food for the first time in pittsburgh .
tasteless and boring .
not worth it .
there were bones in the sesame chicken takeout .
disgusting .
no seasoning .
my husband just picked up $ _num_ of take out .
salt apparently is unheard of .
disgusting .
no seasoning .
my husband just picked up $ _num_ of take out .
salt apparently is unheard of .
definitely do not recommend .
only bright side , chinese food delivery was fast .
avoid this place !
the first time , i got fries and a buffalo chicken wrap .
it 's this strange hot sauce that looks like a vinaigrette .
i like to get wings with _num_ sauces mixed together .
bad : everything else .
not worth the money .
place business !
pizza tastes like cardboard .
but i guess enough people do like their food .
tonight i returned to the familiar cozy little dining room once more .
Negative
ridiculous .
i 'm hoping i just caught them on an off night .
really not that great .
we were there on a saturday night , and it was quite busy .
it is unacceptable .
is it just impossible to find fresh sashimi in pittsburgh ?
weird , weird place .
really weird place .
it was also really expensive for the portion we received .
disappointed .
it felt a little rushed but we appreciated the customer service .
service slow .
i mean , come on !
was i just eating bargain bin sushi at designer prices ?
probably never will .
the salmon smells weird .
service is terrible .
we ordered chicken , beef and salmon teriyaki .
sashimi just so so , we had salmon and uni sashimi .
poor quality .
sushi was dry .
rice was dry .
i was a bit underwhelmed by this sushi experience , especially for the price .
i 've tried a number of times and the product is only passable .
big mistake .
again , nothing really to rave about .
my roll combo also suffered from a strange temperature issue .
one point off .
i mean , seriously , whole foods makes better sushi rice than this place .
tastier rolls too .
ick .
we left extremely disappointed .
the customer service could use a little work though .
she makes you feel like you are ordering your bagel at the prison cafeteria .
why is it so hard ?
i 've been here twice , once for dinner and once for dim sum .
dim sum is overly greasy .
szechuan dumplings in hot sesame sauce : what ?
)
, red bean buns and on and on .
.
then i ate all the fortune cookies for our table .
this place is horrible !
they seem to have started just adding sugar and grease to their food .
very disappointing .
it was disgusting !
gross .
it 's not that hard .
if bagels are your thing , you 'll like this place .
very not inside with an odd odor .
many people did n't get their money back .
i went there today for a late breakfast with my family .
so i wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff .
hill e 'n p is a dive diner chain for sure .
this location is hipster central on the weekends after the bars let out .
i 'm used to real jersey diners .
this diner , in comparison , is kinda the equivalent to friendly 's .
they spent money on new art that shows the neighborhood .
if i recall correctly , the amount was around $ _num_ million .
they have enough money to donate $ _num_ million to charity .
the food tasted dismal , and the portions were small .
wow ... unbelievably disappointed .
appalling .
this guy is out of business .
another mediocre sushi experience .
the restaurant was small , cash only .
the food was typical diner breakfast food .
now , mineo 's ... better pizza .
ugh .
the pizza tasted like junk .
i could n't even finish it .
their pizza is not awesome .
the service was terrible .
this was i think a _num_ slice pizza .
i am not my mother .
the wedding soup arrived rather hot ( microwaved ) and in a styrofoam container .
what i tasted made me stop eating .
the employees not so much .
but do n't sell beer .
flavor is not included with the cost of the pizza .
disappointed now !
sugary tomato sauce , cheese is like aged american cheese .
wow , _num_ stars ?
they were rude .
however , yelp have it _num_ stars .
but that 's the problem .
( i am not ashamed .
the crab rangoon was obviously frozen .
it was cold inside .
i was not happy .
would it be that hard to mix up an original dipping sauce ?
as far as thai goes - this is just your average thai place .
bad customer service .
restaurant is noisy when crowded .
we had the fish in ginger sauce and mixed seafood with basil leaves .
ordered chicken pad thai and the thai wonton soup .
i ate here last night .
secondly , the quality of the food was laughable .
my boyfriend and i went last friday night .
terrible .
_num_ .

conclusion : avoid avoid avoid .
seating was not a problem .
the meal was just ok.
the appetizers were disappointing .
the beer selection and prices were fine .
the bill pretty much topped it off .
if you are vegan , have allergies , etc .
the food was nothing special .
_num_ for the food .
my dinner partner ordered the chicken satay ( $ _num_ ) for five .
rude service !
skip this place .
i have been to several different locations ( bloomfield , sq .
i am also not really a fan of this chain of salons .
are you kidding me ?
if i go to get a haircut , i want a haircut .
this salon is mediocre .
a little too expensive .
bad haircut .
this salon claims that they consider hair texture and face shape when performing cuts .
i scheduled and had a pedicure here april _num_ .
whole experience was lackluster .
grill is n't someplace that i 'd suggest to return to because honestly ?
horrible time .
the cole slaw that accompanied my last dinner was comparable to kfc 's .
zero stars .
should 've gone to outback .
same prices , but better quality .
cheeseburger sliders : way over done .
salmon burger : all bread crumbs .
you let me down , yelp .
i love plain cheese pizza .
i live _num_ miles from the establishments .
not a great way to run a customer service oriented business .
ummm , gross !
not really any bright spots here .
for pizza , its not cheap .
the place has not been renovated since the _num_ 's and it shows .
cheese was pure solid , too salty , and half an inch thick .
this should not happen .
i lived in brooklyn for a few years , i know pizza !
this was horrible !
mineo 's is terrible .
ny , pan , chicago , etc .
just too much cheese .
just not good pizza .
the pizza was tasty , but very messy .
wooden walls .
_num_ pepperoni and _num_ sausage and mushroom .
my biggest complaints lie in the sauce and construction .
also both pizzas were impossible to eat .
pizza is nothing special .
sauce and cheese ordinary .
not too much but more than i wanted .
after all the hype about this joint i decided to check it out .
gross pizza .
way too hot .
poor service .
dirty dining room .
it 's sad .
but this new bread of employees is for the bird .
bad decision !
still do n't get it .
not picked up .
)
it 's not that crazy !
i got over it until button number five was smashed .
horrible !
Neutral
negative _num_ stars .
the stench was unbearable .
this guy is awful .
not a fan .
it struck me as a diner with a bar in it .
the squirrel cafe seemed like a little mom and pop place .
i wanted to give this place a better review .
this place makes me want to order in and drink at home .
no glasses . ''
i 'm _num_ years old .
it 's your job to serve drinks to complete strangers .
at this point , i 'd had enough .
this was my first and last visit to this place .
what an absolute disgrace .
worst place ever .
unhappy memory .
it 's like tiramisu in beer form , people .
i ordered the turkey and pesto sandwich .
my gyro platter was just okay .
service was terrible .
and cheated me .
this is false .
what the hell ?
just tell me what is going on .
nope .
i 'm actually glad i got out of there without spending any money .
the coffee is mediocre .
_num_ .
_num_ .

so i have never reviewed a place in my life .
from the outside , it seems like a nice enough shop .
_num_ stars .
big mistake !
horrible service .
check out another location instead of this one .
atmosphere at sam 's is as thin as the service .
rude rude people at counter .
very expensive and just okay subs .
price was alright .
workers are extremely rude !
need better customer service skills .
lost some weight .
fell apart within a week .
fell apart again .
this gym is terrible .
i do n't normally write reviews .
the equipment is nice , the staff are not knowledgeable though .
_num_ months later i noticed my credit card was still being automatically billed .
much better and more reasonably priced facilities not far away .
for tea , late-night hunger cravings , dinner , lunch , dessert .
here , i normally stick with what i consider safe options - club sandwiches .
the cheesecake with strawberries is typical and satisfied my sweet tooth at least .
quite possibly the most overrated restaurant i ever went to in pittsburgh .
Positive
the negative ?
this place was terrible .
nasty .
portions are plentiful , the atmosphere is comfortable , and the food is average .
with that said , the desserts we had were pretty tasty .
low quality food !
not really cake at all .
the cheese wontons were okay but the cheese tasted just a bit off .
and now that it 's winter , it 's extremely cold inside .
it had not even been seasoned .
nothing has been free .
i hate it .
but even so , it spoiled the evening .
this is your typical average chinese restaurant .
when they say spicy , they mean spicy .
actually the small portion of soup deserves 1/2 star .
no flavor whatsoever .
now the worst part .
very bland .
no veggies .
i was still hungry afterwards .
this place gets _num_ star from me .
she returned hers as well .
there 's nothing inside the wonton .
i called once and gave my address and they confirmed they would deliver .
i was sooooo disappointed !
anyway ... .
greasy over cooked shrimp !
i 'm over giving this place big praise .
not true anymore !
we chose the room by the river where we faced the steel bridge .
appetizer : rare tuna which was sliced too thin .
quality of tuna was ok .
$ _num_ the crab meat `` was '' lump .
fish was cooked correctly , done but very moist .
lump crab was highlight of dish .
it tastes like a buffet to me .
not as fresh or as flavorful as i would like .
also , i like a little mimosa with my brunch .
it 's time to take charge and get the food up to par .
other than that , we have nothing much good to say about grand concourse .
both wife & i had cowboy steak entree with mashed potatoes .
go elsewhere to eat !
this was probably the best thing i ate .
however , easter was a whole new game .
that was just not cool .
however , that is were the excitement over the food ended .
two people in our party ordered fish ( one tilapia and one sole ) .
they were brown and dry .

wrong !
ca n't beat that donut machine for brunch though !
the entire concourse was closed off for a wedding reception .
the coconut shrimp with mango salsa were excellent .
in the end , it does n't look like we will be back .
i wish i was joking .
our salads arrived and chris and i both finished our drinks before our salads .
but i expect nothing more .
the fish itself tasted old .
okay it is the holidays so we overlooked it .
horrible service for brunch !
left message on yelp hoping i can stop people from experiencing what i did .
it was so disappointing !
they really need to fix the setup they have for brunch .
long long wait for food .
some food was cold .
one order was wrong .
not anymore .
the crab cake was dry .
total rip-off .
brunch is served on sunday , in the main dining room until _num_ .
the ladies room could have used some attention .
i would n't hurry back .
a couple of cheap seats at a pirates game .
really not good .
caesar salad a little better , romaine was green .
not much by way of vegetarian or vegan options .
unfortunately they were cold !
okay , back to the review , is it hard to mark the offerings ?
the buffet is spread out in about _num_ different areas which are not visible .
you ca n't tell what is whipped cream , cream cheese , or butter .
everything on the buffet was cold .
cold eggs , cold potatoes , cold bacon , cold sauted veggies .
i went for the brunch buffett with my wife on sunday .
oh , the food , that would be good to mention too .
felt like the staff was hired from mcdonalds .
it was really busy on easter sunday .
i am sorry .
i 've stayed here before and not had issues .
not sure .
also - this hotel is loud !
stained carpets , stuff sitting out in the hallways .

in _num_ degree weather .
instead of a king bed , it had a full size bed .
horrible service .
no turnover of tables .
convenience is the only plus .
not a good idea .

my complaints are simple , and i think they 're reasonable .
first , the flowers that were delivered were nothing like i had ordered .
there were a few giant shrimp and much sliced pork .
it is just ok .
deplorable service , food takes an average of _num_ hours to deliver .
_num_ hours !
the shrimp were hard and tasted old .
the other two and a half out of three got left in the bag .
this places seems to be way off with their delivery times .

the last thing i ordered was wings .
i ordered food for _num_ of my friends .

i should be more careful paying for something i expect to receive .
i needed about _num_ napkins for the two slices i ate .

the pizza was decent , the pepperoni rolls were better .
i might give them another chance , hoping for better service next time .

it was a thursday night with two other groups at the bar .
this pizza place was one of the only options available for food .
very disappointed .
it was a chicken with stuffing , mashed potatoes , and fresh vegetables .

on the plus side , the prices were extremely reasonable .
breakfast for _num_ under $ _num_ .

diners in nyc are friendlier .

sadly not our food .
i had _num_ eggs , sausage , hash browns , and pancakes .
the eggs and pancakes were cold .
that sausage was low quality links .
the seating area should be power washed .
very greasy and unorganized .
drama between workers can be overheard , making things even slower .
no such attention here .
she followed me around asking `` are you going to buy that ?
we got the room for $ _num_ a night , which is reasonable .
visiting pittsburgh for pleasure ?
it was very disappointing .
ew ... that kind of shaped my experience immediately .
that 's not customer service .
not worth the money !
never going back .
our room was not great .
also , wifi is not free .
that 's just insulting .
do n't stay here .
we stayed here through a groupon deal .
for the price and the room size , there is much more out there .
i am now finding out that they charge for the internet .
disgusting !
horrible horrible company .
in terms of location , it was near perfect .
stay away from these ppl .
_num_ stars .
these are not luxury apartments .
it 's not worth it .
how many college students do you know living in `` luxury '' apartments ?
this place is a total joke .
never going back .
it 's _num_ days anywhere else .
it can be quite confusing .
walls are thin you can smell and hear everything coming from neighboring apartments .
it 's noisy because of the construction work being done .
nowhere on the website stated that they are under construction .
laundry room looks decent .
other places like grocery stores and restaurants are not within walking distance .
nothing is provided for you .
this building has at least _num_ floors .
learn from my mistake .
terrible !
did n't even apologize !
ruined my day .
if you 're following along , you know that i should really know better .
the only meal that has been enjoyable was breakfast .
burger buns were stale .
wing sauce was n't right .
server accommodated with more sauce but not great .
ugh .
disappointing .
it came out looking like chunky sausage gravy .
two stars is a stretch .
the tour was just ok.
the staff was not friendly !
)
not us .
_num_ of us met for dinner .
poor service !
also , portions are much too large .
ridiculous customer service .

towels were pretty thin and yucky .
the room was loud .
the three of us finished it quickly and were still hungry .
i would not come back here .
the service was terrible .
not impressed .
- servers not knowledgeable at all about their menu .
the whole thing tasted and felt boxed and pre-made .
bland !
and overall ... there 's several better italian offerings in this city .
maybe , if enough folks in our group voted for it .
very below par .
skip this one !
bad idea .
another bad idea .
actually , there are italian restaurants across the river or further up carson .
just avoid buca .
very bad this time .
tonight i went to this location .
tonight was a disaster .
it looks like a spaghetti warehouse .
the food was much better the second time that i came here .
it also smells like a chuck e. cheese ball pit .
food was so-so , atmosphere was loud and cramped .
we walked in at 8:00 .
um yeah , no .
no free bread .
my parents , sister and i ate here for lunch today .
they need replaced !
i think little caesars pizza is better and cheaper .
the boys got the linguini and clams , nothing great .
the worst .
each time , i 've become less impressed with their food .
before ordering our food , we had use the restroom .
the pizza was cheesy , saucy , and good .
there was more fried batter and cheese than eggplant , however .
Negative
i believe this is a serious health issue and sanitation concern .
do not eat here .
we ordered garlic bread , rigatoni , and chicken marsala .
no waitress either .
hoping to find a bite before my next call .
food was terrible .
service was horrible .

it 's a chain , i get that , more on that later .
not anymore .
i guess cold is the theme for the meal .
green beans ( cold ) .
had dinner here sunday evening with relatives from out of state .
having been born and raised in chicago it was a familiar concept .
yes , as i said , i 'm from out of town .
i opted for the hot sausage with cheese .
as a facility , the place is all old-school pittsburgh steel construction .
really awkward .
if you do , lower your expectations .
are you effing kidding me ?
like , strips it like and effing cheap ass screw .
nothing !
thought it was nothing special .
was the definition of a dive bar , smoky , dimly lit and crowded .
for a dive bar i thought the beers were a little expensive .
plenty of arm room and i could have a normal conversation .
i 'm not big fan of joe 's .
the drinks and appetizers came out very quickly as did our main meal .
too quickly .
drove into pittsburgh really late at night .
they 're in michigan and our birthdays are two days apart from each other .
just not in michigan .
your utensils are presented in buckets .
hate .
but i will eat cornbread and other various things made of corn .
the crab nachos were made with a mayo like paste .
the waiter joked saying , `` it might be too spicy for you ! ''
we do n't actually need a joe 's crab shack in new york .
at best , it 's just another red lobster minus those cheesy biscuits .
the food here is greasy and over-cooked , and not all that appetizing .
it was cold .
stay the hell away !
not allergy friendly at all .
needless to say my beautiful wife opted to not to eat there .
this was my first ( and most certainly last ) visit to this restaurant .
the fries were cold .
not really worth the price .
i always get the crab daddy feast .
probably just gon na go to red lobster .
this restaurant sits inside the sheraton hotel atrium .
went with a party of _num_ for my friends bachelor party .
made me wish i liked eating them .
nobody likes him though .
the draft selection was limited to bud 's finest .
let me start with the very beginning .
after some time , she brought out our drinks .
horrible place .
by friday afternoon , i had emailed my application to eric .
complete bs !
same issue .
if i could give less than a star i would .
this restaurant tried to steal my money .
this place claims it is open until 2am but it never is .
they gave me a steak calzone .
anyway , my first experience was decent .
this is american diner food , i.e .
i have n't found anything remarkable during my visits here .
this is a gas station and not a restaurant .
i dropped off pants and a suit jacket to be dry cleaned .
my tech used a powder and liquid just like they do for acrylics .
i do not recommend this place .
sooooo disappointed !
i 'm amazed that they 've managed to stay in business this long .
overpriced garbage .
they 're always rude .
they 're slow .
just , ugh .
so bad .
pizza that tastes like pizza .
i came out smelling like an ash tray .
then , a basket of bread came out .
our meals included soup or salad , potato , and a vegetable .
just like grandma would make .
not too impressed .
these things were stuffed with filler and the portion was tiny .
the sides , however , were pretty good .
this place is awful .
however this place failed .
never going back .
no stars from me .
zero !
but yelp needs one so there it is .
wrong .
the pasta was awful .
i will not be back .
for what they charge you would think their customer service would be stellar .
issues taking an order for _num_ blizzards .
seating on the street outside was cleaner than the booths .

not many toppings or candy in them .
along with all of that , they are very over priced .

you get far less than you pay for .
not worth it .
no questions asked .
that feeling quickly changed to dread .
stopped in for sunday lunch .
i was not disappointed .
i hear they have a breakfast buffet on saturday and sunday .
it says this in all the online ads for the hotel as well .
try this place if you want a belly ache and need to pass gas .
place was disgusting !
wait staff walked by us several times .
the food was nothing special .
it 's fries topped with their pot roast and gravy and some cheese .
it was really disappointing .
no thanks .
but then again , these restaurants always seemed to copy each other 's menus .
mediocre food .
terrible customer service .
into trying somewhere new , and avoiding chain casual dining whenever possible , esp .

gluten free chinese outside of my regular relationship with pf ?
chinese food ... really you 've turned your back on me !
i said , `` please , i 'll tip . ''
i was quickly seated at a booth and given a menu to look over .
my hot and sour soup followed shortly behind .
remember that old commercial `` where 's the beef '' ?
all you could taste and all you could see was this doughy coating .
do n't believe me ?
the shrimp is on top and the dough is on the bottom .
so i just left .
all i ordered was soup , something you have already made .
i stopped in with a friend who came downtown specifically to have lunch .
it just did n't taste right .
understaffed for a busy lunch , you will see wait staff running .
the service was terrible .
we normally start our tip at _num_ % and go up from there .
the basics , the specials , the chef 's specials etc .
for the main courses sesame chicken and singapore rice noodle .

this mcdonald 's really sets the brand standard .
some practices may be limited on what they can do of course .
what a terrible disappointment !
i had _num_ adults in my party and _num_ kids .

it also seems like more employees need to be walking around to squash that .
the playground was awful .
walking in tube through water side by side to a shark was cool .

food very cold .
only item that was hot was the complimentary tea .
the shrimp looked huge when i got them , so i was excited .
and i mean tiny , like 1/2 inch size .
we were disappointed .
after coming here for two years for minor service , i 've had enough .
prices very cheap .
do not buy season tickets .
are you fucking kidding me ?
Positive
Negative

they had nothing available and recommended i keep calling back .

terrible experience .
i hopped in and the man greeted me by name !
the cab was clean and he was a safe driver .

this city needs some competition for this company .
in chicago , cabs are part of the transportation landscape .
are you kidding me ?
we were standing right there about to walk over to the cab .
this business is terrible .
how 's that for utterly insane ?
we booked a cab through taxi magic .
not cool man .

four outlets for customer use in the whole place ?
gross .
the advertised `` mixed green salad '' was cut with iceberg lettuce .
food was downright poor .
sushi was small portions at large prices .

it is quite expensive relative to other gyms of similar caliber .
classes were fairly limited at this location .

the tables were not very clean .
my salad came out with my entree , chicken parmesan ( fool proof right ?
it was stone cold .
spaghetti was way overcooked .
you could see where the breast was cut in half .
they really do not even deserve one star !
this was bad pork .
all fat and grease .
the color was gray and the texture was slimy .
we ordered two entrees , _num_ turkey dinner and _num_ beef brisket dinner .

very bland food .

been here _num_ times and only once did i get great service .
other times , i 've come solo and sat at the bar .
the corn on the cob is out of this world .
the portions are very large , a lot of food for the money .
nothing ( except the corn ) is what i would consider above average .
mediocre at best .
in addition , my meal seemed _num_ % pre-made and microwaved .
the fried pickles were heavily battered and super greasy .
why are these two unlike any others in any other state ?
terrible food and worse service .
it was a major craving during my wife 's pregnancy .
i 'm not a fan .
if this is your thing then chow down .
we have been to this location several times .
however , the food is always not been so great .
stale and overpriced .
may come back may not .
wish i could do less than _num_ star .
not recommended .
my daughter 's food was great , she had the cheese ravioli .
i wished i had gotten that dish as i got the meatball sub .
yeah i know steak at a seafood place strange right ?
i believe we spent more time waiting on things than we did eating .
i have never been treated like this from a chain restaurant .
never again ... ... ... .
lousy service .
everything on the plate was covered in greasy sauce .
i keep trying to give this place second chances but it never works out .
i would recommend maybe another location or another restaurant .
restaurant is not the cleanest .
avoid this red lobster .
often frequented by big groups celebrating a bday or some other social occasion .
cheap lobster will do that .
maybe the waiters were scheduled for _num_ .
on special was split crab leg dinner for $ _num_ .
dumb on my part .
as soon as i got near the bar , it hit me .

this one seems to be very crowded .
hardly any walking room .
seems this gm only cares about the bottom line not you vacation experience .
we immediately went back down to the front desk and requested a room change .
reason .
i went through it all over again .
why would they know me ?
this is complete bs .
no way !
ok place for the kids birthday parties or group treats .
on the weekends , forget stopping here for coffee .

well never had a salt lick described as a hamburger .
yes , another salt lick that could double as a hockey puck .
not to worry though the app 's were great .
i brought my wife , daughter and grand daughter here for dinner tonight .
very disappointed .
the server brought out beers and it was 2-3 inches not filled .
no shit !
by the way ... nobody finished their meal .
very disappointing .
i feel dissatisfied .
now here 's the home run , our waitress was polite and patient .
we will not be back !
we ate at the one in charlotte last night and many others .
we usually have good experiences at texas roadhouse .
i ordered salmon , like usual , and it was only warm .
i am traveling through town and wanted to place a quick takeout order ... .
i would defiantly choose another restaurant !
the meats on the choices could be better in taste .
i regret my steak choice .
this should n't happen .
longhorn steakhouse has shown they can do this steak better than texas roadhouse .
no complaints .
we finished our meal and sat , and sat , and sat .
the service was slow .
he says $ _num_ .
so it does n't matter which steak i ordered .
i will not go back .
it is n't just _num_ waiter or _num_ cook .
a few of us went here on tuesday night to check things out .
the drink specials , _num_ pbr and _num_ high life made me laugh .
i would n't go back .
yes , the chicken is like a whole chicken in a giant bun .
i finally walked out .
twin peaks was much better !
later we went in to watch the fight which was on the tvs inside .
just a sub par place .

my second visit was for the ray lewis book signing .
thin walls .
... my room was clean and staff was efficient .
very inconvenient and annoying !
what hotel does n't keep the smoke alarm batteries changed on a regular schedule ?
went here with my people and it was just okay .
the first thing we got was , of course , chips and salsa .
seriously , how can you screw up chips and salsa ?
i like guacamole , and my boyfriend 's addicted to the stuff .
place not clean at all !
had a terrible experience .
a waitress pointed to another table , which was clean .
not a friendly little restaurant in my eyes !
atmosphere was weird .
i assume if you are a regular , you 're treated better .
i went in today to get chicken noodle soup from the salad bar .
the container was empty .
i only came to get _num_ new tire .
disappointing older hotel .
it just needs a little attention .
the bathroom was gross .
we changed rooms to the one next door , which was moderately better .
wow !
my car was experiencing transmission problems and i was recommended to this business .
i had the car towed to carolina car care .
when he came back , he kept asking more questions .
thing was , i am planning to buy .
no luck .
_num_ .
tried the whole payment pricing ... i.e .
_num_ .
do not go to this dealership !
when i arrived and met ken all he wanted to see was the check .
it hurts but that 's why they make water !
i only buy the pizza if i have a coupon .
very cheap and tacky looking .
chicken parm and meatball are both a lot of food for the money .
everytime i order something there will be problems .
they never seem interested in serving you .
food was awful !
no thanks ... .
( _num_ adult and _num_ kids ) .
the skate sizes run a shoe size too big .
nothing new here .
my husband and i called them to get an estimate on a garage door .
then it took an additional _num_ months to get a half butt estimate .
the worst pedicure ever !
absolutely horrible !
how do i get in contact with the owner of this salon .
the service is ok at best .
no hi hello nothing .
just rude .
half of the baskin robin ice cream was put away .
btw only 7pm .
not the best choice .
the prices are cheap , but you are getting what you pay for .
when you call the office it is impossible to get a live person .
much empty floor space .
really do n't get it .
if you want my business , stock your store .
( the lines at the registers are insanely long ! )
i 've never had any trouble there , buy in bulk , etc .
when i was approached by an employee today , i politely declined the service .
)
cheap .
not much more to say .
the operator told me to wait for a call from the technician .
so disappointed .

horrible , horrible experience .
the topping choices were okay , not great ( dill pickle chips ?
look , i am totally a soup and salad girl .

not really but you see my point .
i went here for a quick bite as i had business in the neighborhood .
except it was n't !
the soups were just blah .
this place is gross .
weird , but who does n't like pickles ?
bf ate his salad & whatever soup he had .
the sub itself is pretty awesome .
blank stare again .
it 's a little too crowded for my taste , though .
just this week we had a menu delivered to our home .
so we placed an order which before tax should total _num_ .
they bill me for _num_ .
sad but true , sorry .
pickled jalapenos that is - as hot as kosher pickles .
would not recommend .
the meatballs were so dense .
they serve raw vegetables in their soup ?
i ordered one shredded beef taco and one cheese enchilada .
it was a quesadilla with cheese smothered all over the outside .
but here they put a very little amount of chicken .
much less than any other place i have been to .
very slow service !
i asked for soft tacos instead of hard shell and still got hard shell .
i got ground beef with my tacos and the meat was very greasy .
i 'm sorry .
can not recommend .
fruit bowls were plentiful at the breakfast buffet .
luggage cart was extremely difficult to steer .
this teeter should be called harris teeter junior .
my husband and i went there for wings .
wish we had n't .
we got wings , side salads , a water and a pepsi !
this is not a deli .
this time i got chicken parm .
it was not chicken parm .
the chicken was not breaded .
the marinara was bland .
i hate verizon .
typical poor service .
avoid this location !
speaking of drinking beer , their bartender on saturdays doesnt come in until 5pm .
why do they make you feel like you are nuts to even ask ?
big mistake .

often have to wait to get inside .
will not eat here again .
enchiladas were just ok nothing special .
chicken was without any flavor and super chewy .

talking with servers and other employees it seems to happen a lot lately .
i 'm just concerned that if i return i will have a similar experience .
does anyone know where kathy went ?
i 've came here twice to get my gel manicure done .
will not go there again .
is dirt cheap compare to other places i been too .
sanitation of equipment was dismal .
gross !

maybe better luck next time !
waited too damn long .
get more staff and cover the shift accordingly .
oh wait , i forget .
ugh .
awful chinese food .
do n't drive too far to get there .
not even close .
the dumplings are thick and doughy .
others are just damn cranky .
this place was pretty busy for a weekday .
when it was time to checkout , the lines were pretty long .
not a fan .
terrible food .
i got the cheese enchilada with refried beans and rice along with a margarita .
our visit was horrible .
first trip was a late night trip so expectations were low .
food was poorly prepared .
i should have worried .
it was pretty bad .
having hot sauce on each table is a definite plus .
am i missing something ?
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
i immediately grabbed my purse and stood up .
will never go back though .
very poor service .
horrible experience .
Negative
i hate this location .
service is bad .
the menu had maybe _num_ items .
also , it was pricey for what you got .
we were so disappointed .
it was barely edible .
my husband chose the special : scallops over risotto with vegetables at $ _num_ .
ugh .
wrong .
that i do n't like .
( f $ & # ! )
the family member i was with is all about discounts , coupons , etc .
kinda the same effect i feel after eating at mickey d 's .
that is n't good .
the outback needs to be out back .
our waitress was promptly attentive .
this location sucks .
no service ... no stars .
from the moment we walked in , the crowd was an odd mix .
so i guess it 's ok then , right !
charlotte native here .
you 'll get a better burger at a sports bar .
saturday call ahead seating for party of _num_ at 1:30 .
mediocre service .
terrible service .
filet mignon was like a hockey puck .
horrible service .
noticed several people were sending steaks back .
$ _num_ bucks wasted !
mine took almost _num_ hours .
i probably should have known better .
the cheese even has kind of an artificial taste like it 's processed cheese .
worse than little caesars .
you can even hear them laughing afterwards trying to entertain themselves .
oh wait , most of them are over _num_ .
wow , how pathetic .
no more chances .
the owner needs to change management or just shut this place down .
today we brought four out-of-town guests by for a late lunch .
utterly disgusting !
she acknowledged the pest problem and said it was due to construction out back .
hard to believe this restaurant is still open .
well only at their convenience , not the customer .
it was absolutely terrible .
the food was awful .
not good !
the appetizers are smaller for the same price .
not worth the money anymore .
the atmosphere was great and the wait staff was very accommodating .
instead of a long drawn out story , i 'll just make a list .
do not get the trout !
they quickly took that plate away .
we returned this month to a totally different experience .
in the four years i 've had him this had never occurred before .
it took me by complete surprise .
terrible .
this place is nasty .
i just want to pick up my husband suits .
not so anymore .
the staff was friendly though !
i will not be back !
its just not my thing .
$ _num_ wasted .
terrible .
horrible store , understaffed .
do n't like that .
i had long since finished my drink , never got a refill .
the first time i went to mario 's it was dismal .
let me tell you it 's not , and it 's very over priced .
will not be back .
the server was borderline rude .
the shrimps taste cheap .
new location not an improvement .
parm cheese , red pepper , pizza stands were all gone from the tables .
less tv 's ( only noticed one ) .
i 'm used to dave stopping by to check on us .
you can cook spaghetti noodles for a whole family for $ _num_ !
food is cheap .
i brought in my daughter 's old clothes , mostly _num_ 's .
they bought _num_ pairs of pants , and a dress for $ _num_ .
so i shopped around a little bit .
so i approached the counter and said i 'll just take my stuff back .
unbelievable .
not worth my time .
here for a tire repair under road hazard warranty .
store is just not that busy .
not quite bojangles or kfc !
terrible service .
as for sauce , i got one honey roasted barbecue packet .
if that sounds like fun , check kohl 's out .
there is always a sale and they often run kohl 's cash promotions .
but not when i get it from this particular store .
are they kidding me .
horrible , horrible , and horrible .
this place is basically a rundown shack that is pretty scary to walk into .
horrible !
got sick twice .
_num_ seconds later she comes back and asks what i 'll be having .
terrible service .
quiet could n't even hear here .
just horrible .
_num_ for the donuts _num_ for service .
apple fritters ... none .
gone are the days of employees that care .
only really go here if i need something right away .
i do not recommend .
very disappointed .
the outside of the burger was cooked but the inside was almost too rare .
the desert consisted of two peanut butter cookies and a blonde brownie .
not good either .
very dry and tasteless .
just sad and flavorless .
no way .
food was n't good either .
my daughter and i went to this qdoba for lunch several months ago .
almost fell in this woman 's food .
nothing to write home about .
it 's just like any other gift shop full of adorable little things .
management does not seem to care much .
on the services side , expensive and not reliable .
total incompetence .
my bike had to be ordered , so there was a wait involved .
i waited a total of _num_ weeks when they promised _num_ .
i would n't recommend .
when jack is back i 'll give 'em _num_ , yo !
if they pick up a single malt i 'll give 'em _num_ .
it 's a dark , open space to watch your favorite sports team .
not your friendly local owned business .
this was neither .
i ordered a beef dish that i always use to test a thai restaurant .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
that was thai chef over on international drive .
so this time i ordered shrimp fried rice and tom kha soup .
i 'm used to thai tea that 's almost like a dessert .
it 's americanized , `` in the style of '' , thai food .
pad thai should not be sweet .
i mean , the food just tastes okay .
i think it 's kind of pricey , too , for what you get .
disgusting !
the smell i can only compare to that of an elephant .
i was a much nicer person back then , i suppose .
not great but good .
the pad thai , not so much .
it did n't taste good .
the pad thai tasted very americanized .
big portion of chicken , veggies , rice , and red curry sauce .
worst service .
buying one thing and getting another ?
so everyone stop patronizing this establishment .
he told her that we were n't upset , she was just drunk .
this use to be one of my favorite places .
boy what a disappointment .
ugh .
the wings are disgusting .
not the best tasting oysters but good but covered the craving .
they all tasted like mud .
she stated that we could sit anywhere .
building is falling apart .
however , this company is very shady .
( i placed her in a home around the time of my move . )
i already rented through another company .
this is my only social media account .
my neighbor deserves the money that was taken out of my deposit .
checked this place out back in the winter .
i just had a beer so i cant comment on the food .
anyway , sat at the bar and grabbed a menu .
this place is my least favorite so far .
our waiter was not very attentive .
big mistake .
california style turkey burger : my son thought it was great actually .
cobb salad : large with lots of iceberg lettuce .
if you 're sober and hungry , think twice .
their chicken philly steak made the list .
at least not a good list .
not good at all .
it just was n't a pleasant experience .
also , never been a big fan of carpet in restaurants .
some of the waitstaff here will completely forget about your table .
which had to be microwaved before served .
and that was only my first experience .
this place is disgusting .
not to mention the prices are kind of high .
ordered the ruben number _num_ .
there goes half my lunch time .
slow service though .
very hit or miss .
service is not a priority .
finally insult .
anyway , we ordered the chicken & shrimp satay for an appetizer .
overall , too much grease .
tough to cut or chew , and needless to say less than enjoyable .
not good at all .
they kindly accommodated this request ( made through a yelp reservation ) .
not really sure why .
not anymore .
tonight was the 4th time i 've been there in the past couple years .
service : awful .
food : awful .
the crab cakes were eh .
nothing special really .
i was hungry , so i ate part of it .
cheap .
entree we ordered crab cakes , a grass fed burger and mediterranean salad .
guac was blah .
i visited this place on a friday .
everyone was waiting for a long time to get their food .
breakfast potatoes are same as you get anywhere .
the place was packed so maybe this was just an off night .
that is beyond ridiculous .
atmosphere : it 's in a house that 's been converted to a restaurant .
no complaints there .
there was a bread basket available with scones and muffins .
the eggs were horrible .
wishing we had a better easter brunch .
searching for decent mexican food in charlotte is like looking for big foot .
not an authentic mexican restaurant .
but if you come here with low expectations you just might like it .
do n't expect anyone to be too friendly or accommodating .
burritos are large , steak could use a little more seasoning .
tortillas are grilled rather than steamed , which i adore .
the beans were al dente - hard .
mediocre imo .
oh well .
what is southwestern and/or mexican food without all the scrumptious sides ?
it tastes like what i 'd imagine hospital burritos would taste like .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i got a chicken burrito and she had a bean or veggie burrito .
the burritos were good but not fantastic .
_num_ .
neighborhood parking was hit or miss .
_num_ .
it is awful .
oh the somewhat talked about queso ?
the guy at the counter is responsible for the second star .
needless to say , i was full .
_num_ get your food to go .
i 've had better burritos .
it should be called rice burrito .
here , i 'll save you the time and trouble .
go to qdoba or chipotle for a better burrito .
it was not .
am i paying extra for the hipster atmosphere here ?
i can get a much better burrito at any of the mexican restaurants around .
parking sucks here .
went in for lunch today and had the bbq steak burrito .
not impressed at all .
the steak queso burrito at qdoba is _num_ times better .
i could have made a better burrito at home and saved $ _num_ .
what a waste .
big thumbs down .
the queso was good but the burrito itself was average .
it had way more rice and beans then chicken .
this is definitely not my go-to mexican restaurant .
i was still hungry afterwards .
the food is n't especially good and certainly not memorable .
it borders on bland .
customer service was abysmal .
very disappointed .
worst idea ever .
i have the gel all over the skin next to my nails .
_num_ , c'mon .
the joke was on me though , for being such a sucker .
they have nothing better to do than to call the towing company .
horrible business practices !
which pissed us off .
the restaurant was only about 1/3 full at 12:30 pm on a wednesday .
it is definitely not handicapped accessible .
our server does get points for assisting my companion with a wine selection .
food was ok but nothing special .
the hostess was very personable and accommodated us sitting near the window .
not acceptable .
quite the disappointment .
my fiance had the salmon served with spinach .
things started off looking nice .
that is not a solution .
did the chef even taste this before sending it out ?
my wife and i went with another couple for a birthday celebration .
was i disappointed .
my boyfriend went with the beef tenderloin .
this chicken was very garlicky .
not a fan .
waste my money .
the french toast sticks were a little hard around the end crust .
do n't ever get the seafood risotto .
rude !
horrible experience !
slow slow slow !
it was the only one left with the perfect victoria fillet .
the waitress was not nice !
let me start by saying , i have always been an outback steakhouse fan !
this outback needs a total overhaul !
_num_ minutes later ... .
they did include avocado , but that 's all she could taste .
rough day for outback , clearly .
ok , here goes .
this past visit brought my review to a _num_ star rating .
sirloin and grilled lobster and a fully loaded baked potato .
very disappointing .
i guess the price should tell me what to expect .
stop putting ads that pop up like a highly rated restaurant .
the boyfriend sat down at the bar immediately and i ran to the facilities .
it was burnt as hell .
which makes no sense .
next time we feel like some outback , we 'll just go to longhorn .
bad service .
and it 's $ _num_ .
will not be returning .
that does not fix cars !
the shell at park and scott is so much nicer .
but then i 'm into that kind of thing .
he was very apologetic and very professional .
i am still so hungry it hurt !
the best part of the meal was the duck egg rolls , amazing .
someone , besides our waiter brought our meal and mixed up the dish setting .
however , the manager walked around and never greeted the guests or inquired .
steaks are the worse .
not worth mentioning the rest .
the chef needs to go back to culinary school .
but then again , what a great problem to have .
sorry , i disagree .
it was thursday night and only a hand full of people in the place .
( sad ) .
they only served about _num_ spoons of cauliflower .
the waiter was applebees material .
it was n't worth it .
maybe it 's because it 's restaurant week .
shame on you !
my wife and i invited some friends to join us during resturant week .
the entrees looked more like an appetizers .
the desert was a joke .
the service was terrible .
our party of four was sat upstairs .
it was dry and had little flavor .
the desserts were decent , though not overwhelmingly good .
and , the lamb rib appetizer was all fat .
waitress a bit too much .
i have to knock a star off my previous review after my latest visit .
i then switched to the pizza buffet .
i chose the creamy chicken .
no buffet .
still no buffet .
very little seating in there .
totally overpriced and not worth the money !
went there only bc it was recommended by a friend .
that was my cue to leave .
sorry , little .
he says the fees are not currently going toward the neighborhood .
this place had made so difficult to adopt a puppy .
nasty .
threw the crap out asap !
horrible , horrible customer service .
grandma driving slow .
that 's it .
but there are a couple that just do strange things with bagels .
i ventured out to einstein 's to try something different for breakfast .
disgusting !
disappointing .
counters and tables have n't been wiped down in some time .
if this is a franchise einstein 's should pay a visit !
_num_ asiago and _num_ pretzel how hard is that ?
bunch of idiots .
i ordered a lox on spinach florentine bagel without onion or tomato .
not toasted !
the grade at the location is _num_ health inspection .
i 'm really shocked and hurt !
really disappointed .
i will not be back .
custom lost for life .
very rude .
real bad all around .
you can leave it where it is ! ''
Neutral
horribly rude company !
the whole situation was a shady shake down .
it was a saturday and very busy .
not professional .
lock your damn door if you 're closed for the night !
worst customer service ever !
i 've spent hundreds of dollars here .
i will not be returning .
horrible experience .
wow i was very taken .
unpleasant experience .
i will not be coming back .
i mean , really ?
no way .
for the price that this company charges , i was expecting more professionalism .
not quite sure what all the hype is about .
chicken was decent .
it 's really the sides that disappoint at price 's , though .
no bueno !
the chicken had obviously been cooked earlier in the day & left to sit .
this place is all hype .
the chicken is very crispy , but that is all .
man this sandwich was to greasy for me .
had this chicken on more than one occasion .
it was cold .
it was not crunchy .
it was pre cooked fried chicken .
luckily had a few dollars left over to help out my friend .
if only it tasted that way .
there was an odd taste to the chicken which was almost like soap .
the chicken king right down the street from me is a much better choice .
i admit , expectations were high .
they have no seating .
all and all the hype is much greater than the bite .
nothing unusual by any means .
my first ever experience was very short of the expected hype around this place .
Negative
very little meat very greasy .
which kinda sums up the rest of my experience .
i lost .
ordered a whole fried mixed pieces box and the iced tea too .
this is overpriced garbage .
threw it all away .
i 've had legendary fried chicken in charlotte before .
there were people sitting across the street in the grass , too .
we got chicken , fish and shrimp .
over cooking is the single cause of dry breast meat .
i think bojangles chicken is better in both taste and size .
the chicken was very salty !
i was greatly disappointed .
i was expecting amazingly flavored chicken fried to perfection .
it was completely void of flavor .
calling in orders is a joke .
i assume i just choose my cheese and the rest is just there .
confusing .
horrible customer service !
would n't visit again .
i was all excited about fuel pizza being only a couple blocks away .
in a word : greasy .
veggie on whole wheat was loaded with peppers and mushrooms and more .
you do n't need to worry about it here .
this location is terrible .
terrible atmosphere .
if you want the best fuel pizza , consider a different location .
there 's much better pizza in charlotte .
this was an ok tasting pizza but ive had better .
i live near this fuel and have eaten here on many occasions .
this meal cost me almost $ _num_ .
)
, so be sure to be ready to spend that money .
i had never visited this one before .
its reheated pizza and garlic knots .
no frills .
nothing special .
also , will not recommend .
the guy went over and grabbed it and handed it to me .
not going back .
it 's pizza and _num_ .
not worth going back .
went here for the first time tonight .
i really have nothing positive to say about the food itself .
the service is poor .
the pizza is average so i 'm giving _num_ stars for the pizza .
service was horrible .
pizza dough was too thick .
looked for utensils to cut pizza but only plastic available .
so unhappy .
i could have gone to little cesar 's and purchase _num_ for that price .
i did n't eat the salad .
i will not go back .
the other half was white , doughy , uncooked toppings .
i was extremely disappointed .
nothing , just drinks .
i expected more for my money .
short and not so sweet on this one .
great service ?
Positive
negative _num_ .
chris , morton , capitol , frisco , palm and outback .
not to shabby but do have some complaints .
anywho , we went during restaurant week and did order from that menu .
hence `` homemade '' i assume .
what a shame too .
it could , and should , have been much better .
met a friend for drinks and ate from the bar menu .
it was not .
i expected he food to be much better than it was for the prices .
staff was not very friendly .
went for lunch with coworkers .
the chairs were too heavy and took up too much space .
i will not return and will not recommend .
not s fan !
i also tried sullivan 's during restaurant week .
it may have even been prepared the day before .
our service was n't much better .
i ordered a long bone dry aged ribeye , medium rare .
quite disappointed .
my experience was a _num_ star !
tuna - my friend said , incredible !
i went in for a full set with gel polish .
i was completely ignored .
no one said hello .
so disappointed .
not worth it .
so now any time i stop , it 's just for drinks .
this past saturday , i visited starbucks on east blvd for an iced coffee .
it looked abandoned .
no internet .
slow service .
parking is atrocious .
just walk in the store and there it is .
it seems to be hit or miss .
i normally order a dozen roses from here per month or so .
this is not a nice cvs .
ridiculous !
employees here can be hit or miss .
terrible pharmacy .
they are the worst .
yeah , not really my thing .
i like my beer cold .
this place is horrible .
horrible !
however , now i 'm older & more conscious of my surroundings .
in my opinion place could sure use a makeover .
i thought the staff was kind of weird about the rules .
this venue has never been a cool venue .
- have had to repeat personal info etc .
i was beginning to wonder .
terrible work .
did they keep bowling balls in the cabinet ?
regular people not welcome .
i always feel like i get different opinions when i go in here .
not cool .
do n't judge dilworth coffee by this location though !
and it took such a long time to get my drink .
however , they do have outdoor seating .
the atmosphere makes me feel like i 'm in new york or chicago .
the food was all right , though not incredibly impressive .
i hate this place .
are you kidding me ?
very rude and unprofessional business .
its soooo ridiculous .
everything in my box tasted to par .
my charlotte sushi experience was looking on the up !
so why _num_ stars ?
will not be back .
it was all one big joke until i actually came here .
lame .
anyway , on to the food .
spicy tuna nachos ?
ridiculous !
i am so dissappointed that they have started to cut corners .
i ordered the salmon with gorgonzola sauce for take out .
what the hell !
not even worth a dollar .
it was like a hockey puck .
two thumbs down .
is that too much to ask ?
of course i was at the only location i know , in south end .
i really wish someone would communicate that .
fail !
do not recommend !
it also smelled musty in there .
the reason for _num_ star is that it is advertised as gluten free friendly .
bad experience .
disappointing .
wait time : none , which was nice .
it was a saturday night at 7pm and only half the place was filled .
drinks have been forgotten .
on my first visit , i ordered a vegetarian noodle dish .
the waiter brought it out with chicken in it .
it was the first time i saw my boyfriend not finish chocolate cake .
no imagination whatsoever !
the only highlights were the owner dancing and our server who was very attentive !
parking is frustrating .
there are tons of better sushi place in charlotte .
the music was loud and overbearing for a date .
parking is frustrating .
hit or miss ?
maybe ... but it was a miss for me .
big disappointment .
chicken wings were well cooked , hot and crisp .
but the killer was the smell of the oil on the bread .
are you kidding me ?
charlotte is in desperate need of a persian kabob house .
my husband and i had been frequenting kabob grille .
none of the above happened .
no distinct flavor .
but the size of the portion is small .
this seems sketchy to me , kabob grill .
it was just off .
- baklava : 4/5 ; pretty standard .
big mistake .
husband ordered the chicken pita wrap .
i will not be back .
even though i live very close by , oh well .
i will not be back .
not even close .
for example , now a side of rice costs $ _num_ .
that , in my opinion , is nuts .
also very expensive for not the best .
recently i made a purchase at closing time on a friday .
i am truly offended .
the prices are high , but still less than new items cost .
rude rude rude .
i have been taking my dry cleaning here for over a year .
no tour .
no explanation .
no smiles .
horrible customer service .
be prepared to wait up to an hour to be seated for weekend brunch .
i ordered a carolina classic burger , which has chili and slaw on it .
everything tastes like it was frozen and store bought .
not going back .
the star of the table was the hawaiian chicken sandwich .
just left this place and will not be returning !
just came here for a mother 's day brunch .
my family and i left shortly after another family .
the limeade was too sweet .
wrong .
rather than having a milkshake they served me chocolate milk - literally .
the brunch buffet options were alright .
i was part of a party of _num_ with a reservation this morning .
the reservation was confirmed the day before ( and made weeks in advance ) .
very disappointing .
she returned and stated all the bread had egg .
i was really excited to try this charlotte staple .
blown away i was not .
it was not good at all .
the service was okay but our waitress kept forgetting everything we ordered .
it was just awful .
disgusting !
bacon -- it was bits and pieces of bacon not strips .
over all , its a ok place , kinda pricey imo .
terrible service .
the service is terrible .
our waitress was rude .
if the service was better i would come back .
unfortunately it 's not .
i went home and cleaned my apartment from top to bottom .
just plain terrible .
stopped here for a bite to eat after happy hour at gin mill .
completely and utterly disappointing .
so two friends went inside to get drinks from the bar .
you get zero stars !
some in our party arrived before me and went to gin mill first .
i used to come 2-3 times a week , now about once a month .
horrible experience !
very frustrating .
smoked salmon , potato pancakes , it was all delish .
no thanks .
my only exception to this rule is with breakfast .
this restaurant needs serious training in the customer service department .
was n't impressed .
wait was expected for a sunday morning .
noise from the kitchen was overwhelming .
i got the eggs michael & it was delish .
not so cool .
the bartenders were a little limited in their knowledge of drinks .
nothing really stood out about this place .
after tonight , i felt the need to post my opinion about this place .
they could do more with the minimal space , was a little dissappointed .
a step back tonight _num_ when they were built .
this leaves you with a feeling of being in a cheap motel .
my move in maintenance request was submitted _num_ weeks ago nothing has been done .
bad experience !
charge : $ _num_ !
my friend & i drove out on a monday & the shop was closed .
it says that the hours are 1pm til _num_ pm .
my boys are officially done with trying to visit .
_num_ stars .
am i missing something ?
i went with a gyro combo with french fries for about $ _num_ .
order took way to long after to receive too .
it was not good .
the server was patient with my party of _num_ .
long wait time .
it has been six months and i called to get more contacts .
big disappointment .
disappointed .
the food is not anything special , definitely not as good as five guys .
and only has _num_ rings in it ?
me and my husband visited this place for the first time this weekend .
fries were ok , nothing special .
fries were ok , nothing special .
stop wasting your time .
scum bags .
shame on you .
however , the the average _num_ '' pizza was around $ _num_ .
they specialize in thin crust pizzas .
if you think brixx is good pizza then you have never had good pizza .
specials are not great but prices on the list are reasonable .
went with a big group and shared a salad and a chicken caprese pizza .
c'mon cheese and sauce is what makes pizza !
hawaiian pizza , was eh ok .
this is not good pizza .
getting in and out of their parking lot can be a test to patience .
we also were greeted very quickly .
no thanks .
the bread was also dry .
salad was not good .
never going back .
one of the flowers died almost immediately .
flowers from the farmers market have been much cheaper and lasted longer .
will not use this florist again .
pool , expensive video games , air hockey ) .
this kind of stunk , as pool was the reason we went here .
so i chose the booze .
not my experience at all .
_num_ people for a rehearsal dinner for our wedding .
it 's spaghetti and you 're an italian restaurant .
i have never seen a delivery charge , rather a minimum order for delivery .
what a disappointment .
what a disappointment .
dumped on top .
my boyfriend and i went here for our year and a half anniversary .
actually , maybe not .
and was off before i could even ask about our food .
the choices are creamy parmesan , ceasar , and italian .
i got the side salad with parmesan dressing and he the minestrone .
how absurd !
bad , bad , bad !
i report , you decide .
not so much anymore .
there was more goat cheese than steak and the steak was pretty rare .
this restaurant can not handle large groups for lunch .
when i called it told me to press _num_ for delivery .
horrible customer service .
steve needs some customer service training !
twice i had to send my food back .
the oil for the bread came later , and not with the bread .
our service was slow .
the food was awful .
none of them smile .
miserable bunch of people .
this was a mistake .
it 's loud and the server seems to forget you are there .
the unhappy wait staff .
as far as i am concerned it 's a tourist trap .
my main reason for giving this place _num_ stars is because of our waitress .
she was awful .
we will not be going back .
all he could comp me was some more alfredo .
but free was n't good enough .
horrible food and horrible service .
my wife and i went here on sunday for lunch .
i got a chicken salad salad .
i needed a quick bite before a meeting and settled here by default .
the turkey sandwich filled me up , at least .
i was so bummed today after i went in for a smoothie .
their chicken always tastes dry .
the store hours posted on the door said 9pm closing .
and they were not even filling .
no bueno !
rude management and horrible service .
can you give me utensils and napkins to go ?
yep , _num_ days to clean a comforter .
false .
fail fail fail .
will not be returning .
horrible and expensive !
very disappointed .
i will not be returning .
all in all , it was just okay .
and do n't tip .
they do n't deserve it .
they sent all the results and paperwork back to long 's .
what a mess .
is that too much to ask ?
wrong .
what went wrong ?
i would seriously consider going to another veterinarian if i were you .
i think i will be searching for a new vet though .
they were very busy , but extremely caring .
my advice is think twice before going here !
_num_ is low ?
but that was their only payment plan that they would do for us .
i have been going to this facility for almost a year .
poor kitty .
i 'm just trying to help other pet owners with this review .
corporate should step in and make some serious moves to get this under control .
once that was corrected , he showed me the car .
i recently flew into to charlotte airport then took a cab to this agency .
it was booked through priceline .
i said i would .
first they offered us a choice of pick-up trucks .
would have ben noisy .
i 'm sure it 's a staffing problem .
i find it rude .
i hate being rushed .
turn away now if you are considering this place !
i 'm not kidding .
learn from my mistake .
it does n't surprise me that the inspection is so fast !
i 'm a customer just like the others waiting .
walked into the store and was the only one waiting to be served .
if its busy when you show up i would try another restaurant .
for shame .
very loud place .
it tasted pretty bad .
_num_ star for food .
minus _num_ stars for customer service .
okay , i 'm from san diego .
the fish itself was fine but i received pieces .
my waitress forgot my bloody mary , but she did bring me water .
not appealing at all .
i was not at all impressed .
but then i just remembered # _num_ so back to _num_ it is .
_num_ .
_num_ .
queso dip = yuck .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
quality was nonexistent .
this place is awful .
not good .
i was offered some honey wasabi sauce and i accepted but never received it .
they make you wait forever , service is meh ... .
not real anxious to go back but who knows .
i 've not been crazy about my last few visits to cabo fish taco .
that 's weak .
i think i 'm throwing the towel in on you , cabo .
but , locals rave about this place .
the chips were stale .
wo n't be back .
we went with a group , _num_ in all , on saturday .
sat , ordered drinks and crab dip .
we saw others seated , fed , and gone .
now , i 'm all for leisurely eating ... but not for this .
why did n't i do it sooner ?
_num_ .
our chips were stale .
we were disappointed .
firstly , the guacamole was obviously out of a container .
of course , cabo will charge you considerably more .
or the food improving itself by half ( either way suits me ) .
trying to fill that void .
my husband and i went to cabo fish taco last night .
it was the second time we 've eaten there in _num_ months .
the first time we fell in love .
with tangy bbq sauce ?
the sauce was tasty but out of place , it overpowered the whole dish .
mediocre food .
absurd wait times .
really really loud .
i 'd had tacos from this place before and they were amazing .
there was a low amount of cilantro accompanied with a low amount of flavor .
check your tastebuds at the door !
our beers were very over priced as well .
ugh .
mmmm , no .
ps : i like guy fieri , but he 's not always right .
this place really went down hill .
service has never been good but we never expected it in this place .
they had that store bought flour tortilla smell .
the _num_ minute wait ended up being over an hour .
thankfully the areas surrounding the restaurant were entertaining enough to keep me occupied .
_num_ .
beer battered fish tacos had way to much batter .
_num_ .
_num_ .
bbq mahi tacos were decent .
recently i got the veggie fajitas .
it was so gross .
i did n't finish it .
so last week i went there ( why ?
anyway i started feeling an upset stomach after the first part of the wrap .
chips and pico were served .
wrong !
it was decoration , i guess .
for my _num_ side i chose the refried beans .
i 'm not quite sure what all the hype is about .
what a disappointment !
not a good experience ... .
you 're lazy .
tacky .
not for us .
nightmare !
this place use to be on our short list of regular places to visit .
it was cold .
that was a turn off .
my son got the $ _num_ shrimp burrito from the kids menu .
she picked the shrimp out and ate them solo .
the service has always been awesome though .
i was completely disappointed .
but it totally sucks .
do n't ever get the trout taco special .
they are crap !
slow .
got the tuna salad for dinner sunday night .
do n't believe the hype .
will not be returning .
i 'm not quite sure how it gets such good reviews .
service also sucked .
wrong !
wrong !
i went to cabo fish taco tonight after seeing a live music show .
same with the rice and beans i ordered as a side .
really sub par .
extremely poor service .
do not recommend to anyone .
i ordered the mahi bbq taco and it was very good .
the tuna from cabo fish taco really tasted off .
i doubt i 'll be back .
it did n't get better .
so so so awful !
stale , cold chips .
first off , the chips , salsa , and queso .
not a good start .
for entrees , we split the specialty tuna and bbq mahi tacos .
i 've been here _num_ times .
went here for the first time tonight .
have n't been back .
he should not be serving .
they are not `` authentic '' .
they have very little food made in house .
although my boyfriends tuna burrito is a perfect medium .
it was a weeknight ( a wednesday ) at 7pm .
so , we had to wait even more .
not worth the $ _num_ .
just stick with a margarita and queso .
overall disappointing .
poor customer service .
so so so awful !
stale , cold chips .
looks like a socal beach dive has landed in noda .
wo n't be returning .
not so much .
possibly assuming it was her tip ?
when should you ever assume though ?
no thanks .
this time i walked in to get a manicure .
they definitely are busy , but not my style .
very messy .
wo n't be back .
the gel manicure i got was applied incorrectly .
she says oh someone else is coming to help me .
as i get my shoes one , finally my technician has made an appearance .
never have i ever paid for that .
we walked in and the place seemed ok at first .
ugh .
no thanks .
i 'm with tony c. on this one .
customer service is sub par .
dealing with them is like dealing with less the bright _num_ year olds .
i woke up this morning wanting cheesecake .
they had cannoli , and that 's hard to find in this city .
soggy cannoli .
they deserve better love !
the cannoli shell itself was heavy , dense , and oily .
cannoli shells should be light , and somewhat crunchy .
maybe i 'll be back to give that a try ... but the cannoli ?
no thank you .
now for the bad .
no macaroons .
i would -- i was just expecting a little bit more is all .
had the best iced vanilla chai latte every single time .
but today alone has made me never want to go again .
my coffee or tea is always served too hot to drink .
just completely unorganized .
horrible service .
went here on a whim for after dinner treats last night .
not good at all .
very small little place .
i dined alone so i was watching what goes on .
its too cheap !
i can not say enough about how friendly the staff was .
they treated his symptoms and respected my budget .
very few vets remain from visit to visit , turnover is frequent .
so my cat was given another minor surgery and put on a diet .
after going to the second vet , my cat was like a kitten again .
i picked her up on wednesday and she was acting better .
thursday night she started acting like she did monday .
but before i brought her in she was healthy .
wo n't be returning .
this fee is in addition to the hours of waiting that you do there .
however , your bill will be a tall one with every visit .
they placed an iv and gave fluids .
my dog died there .
sent an employee to lunch while i waited and generally is an ass .
fast forward and my car is towed there .
no calls this weekend .
no updates .
not good enough .
i 'm not quite sure what the fuss is about .
there 's stuff everywhere and it 's completely overwhelming .
seems like people get pretty comfortable .
downside : not for me .
cool place but slow .
my sandwich was nothing out of the ordinary .
_num_ ) i love that they have beer and wine tastings on occasion .
nothing like trying new stuff !
_num_ ) the parking is not great .
_num_ ) this place is always crowded .
just terrible service .
terribly rude to her .
what an a hole .
he will surely lose business with his attitude if he has n't already .
it was all those things in _num_ , and is all those things now .
it was bizarre .
uh , i was wrong .
if not , it should be .
you can still get _num_ stars .
roughly _num_ % of people attending drive there and park there .
seats were terrible .
it does not work very well .
parking is horrible .
i 'm giving the two stars to the performance only .
my legs were so cramped the whole time that they fell asleep .
awful place .
$ _num_ ?
extremely outdated .
not enough bathrooms .
seats are so uncomfortable .
no food here .
total dive if your looking for that .
Negative
can i get the contact info for your boss .
obviously will not be going back .
dear god .
it is , however , rather inexpensive .
deviled eggs that are to die for !
the kitchen staff works hard and the food is ok .
i ordered the meat loaf ( recommended by friends ) and the mashed potatoes .
they basically take a traditional spinach dip and substitute collards .
the place was almost full when we visited .
come back to us old dish , wherever you have gone .
not me !
ok , i get it , i know about the waiter / waitress rotation .
i got salmon cakes & macaroni & cheese & deviled eggs .
the food was horrible .
and the bartender served me promptly .
very , very small serving of soup .
we both ordered the salmon patties .
not so this evening .
however i am willing to give them one more try .
but next time better be hella yummy !
myself and three friends visited for lunch .
two in the party had never been to your restaurant .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
absolutely a horrible experience .
mac and cheese was as generic as possible .
overall , pretty disappointing .
however , kevin really enjoyed his chicken & dumplings .
i mean real simple .
once the plate came out i was excited to dig into my sandwich .
wrong .
why is my fruit warm ?
the second star for the veggie loaf i tried from someone else 's plate .
this was our first time dining here after hearing about it for some time .
that happens , and we were n't too concerned .
mediocre food , lousy service .
also did not have any flavor .
both times they failed .
we stopped into this local joint during our hour long lunch break .
when we saw the menu we were excited .
we were so disappointed .
i just was n't feeling it .
it is obvious that all of the employees are scared of this person .
ate here last night ... first and last time .
deviled egg ... either made earlier in the day or day before .
much better food in charlotte for the price .
avoid this business .
i 'll leave it to you to decide which is more likely .
this place is a wreck and a fire hazard .
very disappointed .
there 's a bar where you can buy overpriced drinks .
beers were $ _num_ .
the current management does n't get it .
however , the building still stands , but it was destroyed from the inside .
no more .
no ac !
even the lead singer commented on how hot it was .
the band commented that it was the hottest place they ever played .
it is n't .
some people ca n't afford $ _num_ .
also they were looking for was money and not to care for my dog .
entirely too expensive .
i always feel rushed and my questions are not answered .
upon entering the office , i never felt welcomed .
this place is terrible .
very bad service .
scheduled for pickup and delivery to airport .
cab driver never showed up .
do n't be fooled ... it isnt the same .
the roof leaks bad .
drinks were also quickly refilled .
sanitation rating _num_ - not impressive .
and mac and cheese was okay .
it was just ok .
_num_ stars ?
meh ... not for me .
i just was n't thrilled .
maybe i hyped it up too much .
the greasy chips that came on the side were okay i guess ?
not my cup of tea .
they are insanely big though , so plan to share .
am i missing something ?
not the greatest .
um , no .
lacking .
especially when half the water is poured straight down the filter .
these folks need proper training .
meh , this has never been a super impressive shop in my opinion .
i have n't seen anything new pop up in here .
prices are so high that i 've never once considered buying anything .
walked inside greeted the worker which from the conversation must be the owner .
they were wrong .
my food experiences were mostly ok , but never anything special .
and then there was a rush of people to be seated .
no egg dishes .
maybe i will try one more time and try the banana pudding ?
i was not impressed .
i will not be back .
rude .
it is not worth it .
i even grew up on the east side !
not to overly impressed with any of it .
like a lot of places the prices went up & less food !
we will not be going back .
it seriously tasted just like burger king tenders .
terrible .
but not awful .
fried pickles were standard but good .
and turn the lights down .
now , not so much .
what the hell happened ?
so sad !
if you did , join me in pouring one out .
oh so disappointed .
a mistake .
really very sad .
there are so many better burger joints in town .
visit the diamond for the penguin goodies now .
writing this review breaks my heart .
i have raved and raved about the penguin and been there several times .
i was disgusted .
so sad ... .
gross !
fried to die for .
when we came in , i was excited about this place .
egg , mozzarella cheese & mayo .
good thing i like onions i guess .
ugh .
this place is sure to disappoint .
we stopped in around 2pm on a saturday hoping to have a good time .
i unfortunately understand why .
there were only _num_ people here .
when i recently went there everything about the restaurant was off putting .
i make better fried pickles at home .
if they can get their act together , i may try this place again .
the coleslaw was not good .
a few of us from my office went to the penguin for lunch .
when we received our food , it was nothing like we had ordered !
the fried pickles were thicker , not breaded enough , not fried enough .
toppings unremarkable .
terrible patties .
the small block at the diamond is the burger i fell in love with .
sub fried pickles for your side of fries ?
burger cooked anything but medium well ?
no way !
between the three of us we tried a couple burgers and a chicken salad .
i was informed that the original owners moved to a different location .
ridiculous !
if you look closely , there is a _num_ cent charge for water .
in the same conversation , they asked for the check as well .
Negative
drinks were not refilled timely .
not worth it .
first of all , burgers have buns , not toasted white bread .
literally _num_ hours .
soooo disappointed !
service was terrible !
i first went to the penguin in _num_ and it was awesome .
alas , time has not been kind to the penguin .
it just is n't good anymore .
horrible service !
both were awful .
what a disappointing lunch !
it 's not the same place .
want the classic penguin ?
took forever and was not worth waiting for .
the absolute worst .
when i visit a mcdonald 's restaurant , my expectations ate the same .
my fries were cold !
not warm ... cold !
on the positive note , the food was cheap .
wrong .
the fried pickles are exactly the same as the penguin 's .
seriously , this restaurant needs to start over .
i 'll miss the food and ambiance of the old diamond .
it was worse .
not pleased .
not impressed .
mac & cheese was moist and cheesy and acceptable .
as for the hot dog , well it was a hot dog .
everything about this place is average to me .
if you 're looking for penguin _num_ , do n't be fooled .
service was fast but not overly friendly .
the meat was thin cut and not high quality .
on to the food - i ordered wings and fried pickles .
what a disappointment .
mediocre , overpriced food .
i ordered take-out recently from the diamond through living social .
ok , no problem .
it was 6:30pm after all , dinner rush .
the fries were horrible !
i understand it 's an old building but it could use some tlc inside .
ate there tonight for the first time .
it 's cheap , convenient to my house , and my friends like it .
we had fried pickles which were fantastic , as expected !
the patio was completely open at the diamond with only one couple sitting outside .
finally a server came out to check on the other table .
which is really sad .
it was more like i was eating hard chunks of over fried breading .
the stale pita broke .
a little salt and pepper goes a long way .
however , the mac and cheese made up for it by being over seasoned .
i 've been wanting to try the diamond for years .
crust was the only part worth eating .
will try again though bc i enjoyed my tuna melt sandwich and fried pickles .
consider traveling here only after being drunk .
just seems not sanitary .
not complicated this late .
after eating that oysters i was excited to get my entree .
i ordered a philly , my girlfriend ordered a burger .
not at all impressed ... .
she had to yell out what she wanted .
the spaces were n't clearly marked and cars were parked wherever they could fit .
the waitress was friendly and quickly took our order .
gross !
she just gave us the check .
rarely is it a place that i choose to go .
with few exceptions the food doesnt do too much for me .
only upon returning from the kitchen did he ask whether i want anything different .
no thanks .
so disappointed .
i could n't believe it .
walked in with a buddy at 8:30 on a friday night .
i had a burger w/ fries and my friend had a blt w/ fries .
their backyard is to die for .
it 's 2pm on a tuesday ... i 'm here at lunch .
they 've never met .
but i did stay and ordered the philly cheesesteak with fries .
the fries were fresh and hot .
bad neighborhood .
difficult to park .
it was lame .
the sauce flavor was a little off to me too .
so disappointed ... .
Neutral
the actual car wash was fine , nothing too special or spectacular .
you should really just wash your car yourself .
gus ... oh , gus .
not for the food .
bland and tasteless .
not worth it .
count me in , right ?
on the three occasions i 've visited , the staff have always been curt .
dairy queen can be so hit & miss .
: / it packs in the people though .
i did n't know the difference .
it 's not the long lines .
this is a consistent problem in fall and summer .
first off , i want to say that i 've been here multiple times .
tonight we drove out of our way to go enjoy a last minute dessert .
a big disappointment .
cole slaw was flavorless .
very underwhelming ... .
i have been to the other location in matthews and it tasted much better .
will not be back .
my experience inside this branch was so-so .
which i knew i had not .
it was n't that they could not .
this was not expired .
now i am going out of my way to do my shopping .
wrong .
where was the bowl ?
grits grits everywhere , because these grits were on the soupy side .
the meat had little flavor and was dry .
what really got me was that the gyro sandwich was served as a platter .
just do n't order the fries .
but landmark needs to step it up .
_num_ eggs over medium , sausage patties and french toast .
sausage patties ?
do not go here for gyros .
the owner came to our table and really showed is butt off .
requested cocktail sauce , received barbecue sauce .
very disappointing .
so when i visited this past week , this was my first stop .
i was so disappointed .
as soon as you walk in you an tell that the atmosphere has changed .
the staff is not as friendly .
two of us ordered the italian trio .
it was awful !
i guess the other customers do n't count .
that was way back when they were good .
i was not impressed at all .
i ordered buffalo chicken wings with ranch & cheese grits .
there are hundreds of restaurants in charlotte pick another one with descent service !
all around disappointing .
place was crazy busy with the after church crowd .
check them out for yourself and see what you think .
girl washing the window says they close at 1am .
_num_ .
needs remodeling , cuts in the seats and i mean big ones .
_num_ .
cooks do n't remember what you order .
_num_ .
i was very disappointed .
terribly disappointing .
husband had a hot roast beef sandwich .
roast beef was tough .
service is slow .
checkout is ridiculous .
we had terrible service .
no , greeter lady .
i ca n't spare any change .
just make sure you check the date on the package .
questionable cleanliness .
i left with an upset stomach .
the vegetables are wilted and look old .
will not be returning .
so gross .
craving has been satisfied .
two more parties of black people walk in after me .
skipping forward two months i went on sunday and ordered the chicken tender special .
bad news , folks .
we ordered the veggie plate and tried all _num_ different sides .
the staff were very friendly and the seating area was clean .
they also tucked dill pickles into the thing which tasted strange to me .
greedy people .
it was pathetic .
these people really need to hire competent employees if they want business .
one word ... nasty .
i 've been trying _num_ weeks to schedule a lesson .
incredibly disappointed .
its like they are mixing two recipes , chinese vegetable in the salad dish .
stick to the pho if you go , just beware if you msg allergies .
i will not be back .
the service is horrible .
did n't even apologize .
not recommending .
dishonest practices !
but the prices kill it for me .
first , the place is under new management and the renovations are awesome .
i 've been a loyal customer for more than _num_ years .
_num_ ) , this place is tucked behind an italian restaurant for good reason .
i tried the sesame chicken ; they used dark meat chicken !
this place is awful .
nothing else needs to be said .
feels fake .
the chilli paste on the table is too oily .
_num_ , so its a low b at that .
i was very disappointed .
horrible experience .
Neutral
worst service ever .
it was awful .
_num_ minutes !
not even a sorry .
very slow and inefficient .
bad .
no thank you .
wrong .
where 's the garbage ?
okay , this is a hard one .
if only another hibachi option was close to this one !
i was a little skeptical about ordering anything .
never going back !
the fish on display were in ice was mostly melted .
so i just wanted to put the red flag on customer service .
terrible .
trash .
a plain spicy chicken combo with a pepsi .
i was offered a shot glass sized frosty for my trouble .
do n't usually eat fast food .
seems very disorganized .
worst wendy 's ever .
unbelievable how little the employees care about customers .
it was my birthday so thought i would get myself some treats .
for the best tres leches , go to viva chicken .
what the hell !
also the people around there are scum , too .
ca n't wait to move out .
not to mention that we have called the front office several times .
stay away from these apartments .
every time i turn my shower on , i 'm greeted by rusty water .
valentines dinner .
worst pizza .
no quality here ... .
hey keep your ranch !
pasta ( bolognese ) was very bitter .
meatballs : $ _num_ .
i expected similar food and ambience , was let down .
for what it is , its expensive and the owner is a jerk .
i will never be back .
do n't be fooled by this places high rating .
boring !
for my brother $ _num_ .
you can imagine the horror i felt .
sorry j & s .
inconsistent much ?
_num_ .

i was seated immediately , ordered steak and eggs promptly .
mistake # _num_ .
secondly , we asked for our fries to be cooked crispy .
terrible !
you can not move around during active labor .
i highly suggest you find another practice .
you can not move around during active labor .
it 's gross .
downright disgusting .
i miss the doctors who delivered both of my children .
it 's quick and easy and not too expensive .
these were terrible .
i could n't eat it .
after passing this little place for years i stopped for a late breakfast .
prices are dirt low and the food is basic diner fare .
wrong !
overall , a totally creepy experience .
valid for the next day only .
it may be cheap , but there is a reason for that .
the meal was very greasy & the rice and egg roll were so over-cooked .
wo n't bother again .
ginger chicken is the dish to get if you find yourself here .
there was very little amounts of chicken in the orange chicken .
never received the champagne .
the steaks came out cooked identical , both were cooked well done .
the sauce had so much meat and was heavy sausage tasting .
it did n't taste good either .
there must be better italian in charlotte .
i will have some problems for the rest of my life .
lack of freshness .
mac n cheese tasted processed as well .
however , i 've only gone once .
the main reason is the hygiene concerns .
no reply .
they will randomly leave out at least one item every trip .
i have bought several of your prepared food items .
the kid at the counter is explaining to be how frozen ravioli is better .
unbelievable .
as you walk inside you gets welcomed by the garlic smell .
i am yet to find a truly italian market in charlotte .
enter with low expectations and be surprised on occasion .
fyi , our money is green too !
he might as well have been a character from a dark comedy .
pretty sure i know that if she eats a peanut , she might die .
it 's horrible .
this was a _num_ month follow up visit for my _num_ year old daughter .
a simply routine visit as she is not having any problems .
even the nurses were standing around doing nothing .
Negative
the arugula and spinach salad was drenched in oil .
my husband had to get up to get our own fresh ground pepper .
one of my ( tiny -- hello ?
charlotte dentistry stood out .
the dentist was rude .
she insisted the chart said _num_ .
all the work was finished at the pediatric dentist .
i felt really sick .
cut that cost me $ _num_ .
miserable experience .
_num_ ) asking them a question is a non starter .
worst pharmacy ever .
the worst .
just awful customer service .
this place sucks .
it is so horrible .
this place is awful .
the `` open '' light in the window was switched off .
that was just rude .
i had to immediately place this review as i love total wine .
i hate the place !
do not go to this cleaners !
so frustrating and unbelievable .
he looked at it and then went over to get the batteries for me .
while he was messing around with one remote , i changed the other .
whoa , really ?
found the same watch batteries at lower from $ _num_ less .
not my thing , but sports pubs never are .
not my favorite place .
service is aweful due to management not scheduling enough servers .
thats cause it was all frozen and deep fried .
ridiculous .
waste of money .
stick with beer or wine .
_num_ .
it was my second time here , first time ordering food .
no apology .
it is well maintained but feels old and in need of some love .
the ethiopian restaurant we went to afterwards though -- now that was worth it .
i do not recommend this museum .
the icing was disgusting .
we were completely disappointed .
horrible customer service !
what on earth am i going to do with _num_ bottle of beer ?
disappointing .
instead i was completely underwhelmed .
will not be going back here .
i wish that was all i ordered .
i will only be ordering wings from now on .
the flavor was okay but too salty soy for my liking .
the corn bread was just okay .
that way i know that they would truly get the tip .
mediocre .
i also ordered the chicken soft taco and chips .
we wanted something fast and good before heading to the airport early .
the new potatoes and squash casserole were decent .
if i lived here i would only return for beer .
will not be return .
would i try it again ?
two _num_ '' chicken rib bones .
they are only friendly to customers they know .
i ordered the rotisserie chicken with black beans & queso .
i went back up to get it which was fine .
i 've had the monterey chicken wrap several times , and it never disappoints .
big mistake .
i really , really like wendy 's food .
instead of asiago chicken club , seems i have a standard spicy chicken sandwich .
this wendy 's served me raw chicken .
do not eat at this location .
could n't find it anywhere .
- yes , its cheap .
lots of greek and italian options in addition to the breakfast menu .
as for the food , everything was just okay .
the food was not good .
i ordered a chicken quesadilla , without the chicken , and some fries .
no apology what so ever .
i ordered a skinny slice pizza with veggies on it .
make sure to check your pizza before the pizza man leaves .
it 's saturday night at _num_ pm .
not cool , pizza hut .
not cool .
of sour cream in it , and the rest was refried beans .
minus _num_ star .
are you kidding me ?
um , no thanks .
then we added half of sun dried tomatoes .
not what i ordered .
our initial greeting from the gentleman ( owner ?
that 's all on us ... not complaining about that .
tres annoying .
i guess we 'll have to start driving a little further for it .
the pizza was amazingly thin , and the service was good at first .
i like thin pizza with an initial crunch then some chew to the crust .
nasty .
got sick .
do not recommend .
however , tonight 's visit will be our last .
it started the moment we walked in the door .
while the store was clean and organized the selection and quality was dismal .
rude !
local outdoor store with a small selection of clothes and gear .
it is so very very over priced .
also , the location is rather tough to get to .
not my favorite place .
took my car in at _num_ am .
i came in to purchase _num_ rear tires .
so i pulled up my confirmation email on my phone .
now i also have a constant tire pressure light on thanks to charlotte .
you 're killing people 's cars , park road shopping center .
needless to say , i left quite a bit on my plate .
)
, she accommodated my request for the hockey game .
i do n't recommend going for breakfast .
a few tables walked out .
also , their prices are quite expensive .
it 's definitely cheap .
ugh .
maybe other associates would be better .
however , that 's where it ends .
do it yourself for _num_ bucks or spend _num_ here .
there are chinese restaurants on every corner but only few are actually good .
it was quite bland .
the latest is my breaking point .
but no .
the rep insisted on pointing it out to me .
if you 're a pipe smoker , it 's a necessary evil .
the _num_ stars is just cause i liked josh .
this place plays more to the over _num_ crowd .
returned again , recieved another one with mustard and pickle .
wrong .
absolutely horrible service !
the potatoes were acceptable i.e properly cooked .
in october , i purchased a groupon .
all evening the table shook anytime someone went in or out of the door .
there was also dank mildew odor by our table .
we arrived with a reservation tonight , a tuesday , it was packed !
it was a long stretch of time though between our drinks and our salad .
our server was awful .
i could n't believe it .
i also thought i tasted some old bay on my steak .
daughter had rib-eye , which was better , wife had filet i think .
just eh .
probably not .
she deserves to be in a better venue .
that will cover cheese and bacon on two baked potatoes .
after a long while we get our meals .
the food was mediocre .
fast forward to tonight .
i will not be back .
we really wish we had skipped this one .
very disappointing .
it was awful !
full of fat and gristle , i was in shock .
then when you get inside of the place it looks very fancy .
we came on a week day .
not to mention the bottle of wine .
so you do n't need plates to share the apps .
too bad .
the hostess said that they gave our table away because we were late .
but there was nothing cheesy about them .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
vegetables for the salad were separate and not properly cut .
( is it common to have chopped celery on a salad ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
from the moment we walked in we immediately felt unwelcome because we had children .
if we 're a problem that we had children .
the second time the steak came out gray and cold ... .
a woman approached and poured my fianc and i a glass of water .
we spent _num_ plus $ and were rushed from beginning to end .
sat down right at _num_ .
three visits in a row my order has been messed up .
it 's always extremely loud inside because it 's a small restaurant .
back patio is a little better than the front .
deserts are all excellent .
kitchen - f - details are posted above .
not acceptable anywhere .
the food and ambiance we subpar in my opinion .
not anymore .
i guess the unique fish went away the same time as the knowledgeable staff .
dead .
stay as far away from any business that is owned by this guy .
never going back .
three layers in a _num_ inch cake ?
the people were nice to me , though .
it rubbed off but still very visible !
she was the least helpful person i 've ever met in my life .
they were all dry !
super disappointed .
i read about the bakery and was excited to check it out .
my kids and i stopped in after school to try their cupcakes .
we tried _num_ different cupcakes and every one seemed `` old '' .
you smelled it as soon as you walked in .
hopefully they just overlooked it that one night .
if only it had actually been his last night .
so the bar is really , really small .
tip for service after you sing , not tip just to even get service .
looks like they have some new employees since the last time we were there .
skipping your songs after you have tipped him .
most unimpressive cashiers ever .
let 's just throw privacy out the window .
_num_ minute max to make ?
ok , i could live with that .
_num_ .
i should have walked out then .
i choose the rueben sandwich -- sounded like a safe bet .
i will not be going back anytime soon .
the new menu has things like egg rolls with spicy sauce .
on the plus side drinks are cheap , and the patrons are friendly .
not my kind of lunch though .
two wait staff seemed to be covering the whole room .
they have _num_ menus : entrees and bar food which includes appetizers .
terrible all around .
no refills .
apparently you only get served if you 're best friend 's with the waiter .
will not go back .
the waitress alone was an example on how you do n't treat your patrons .
suddenly when it was tip time she was courteous .
the food was not good either .
my fries tasted like fish .
the wrap was awful .
sure , they have a fish and chips , but where 's the curry ?
where 's the jacket potato ?
burgers are fine , but that 's american food not proper british fare .
do i really have to be a regular to get any friendly service ?
the fact that this place has his approval is not to be taken lightly .
will not be back .
then walked away .
used to be my favorite !
disgusting .
not impressed or coming back .
it just seems odd to me .
needless to say we skipped dessert ... .
rudest bartender and staff i have encountered .
i said they know better and so should you .
my boyfriend and i ate here just an hour ago .
then made my boyfriend ( nicest guy ever ) try a bite .
wait ... they have food , too ?
_num_ .
this put two holes in my brand new skirt .
_num_ .
place is dirty .
my clothes had that dry cleaner smell for days longer than other cleaners .
never going back .
it also takes a long time for them to get repairs done .
too bad .
the predictable result is long waits .
i am very disappointed .
Negative
day _num_ - i walked in and the place was packed .
needless to say i wont go back .
i did not buy lotion .
however , that 's where the nice ends .
and somehow convinced me to do the _num_ dollar membership .
awkward .
a .
the board of health should close them down .
because mine did seem used .
awful awful awful .
weird and rude .
plus horrible customer service .
boy was i wrong .
the tips of my nails were n't painted either .
definitely not , the technician was extremely rough to the point of pain .
lame .
not even close .
i explained this bike was my only transportation and i needed it .
really , $ _num_ for that ?
it was forgettable .
walked away disappointed .
no seasoning at all .
and i ate it on my bread so the marinara gets _num_ stars !
place and wine was ok .
i think the restaurant impossible should visit this place and fire the chef .
headed to try this place for the first time tonight .
not good .
i come here 's few times a month & normally have the same dish .
the garlic bread was covered in it .
my wife and i frequented this place almost on a weekly basis .
never again will i go back .
no thanks !
service slow .
no broccoli .
_num_ ) the cappuccino needs to be removed from the restaurant .
horrible service.
the portofino 's at the other location may be better i hope so .
i suggest you try a different restaurant if you want good italian food .
terrible property manager .
so my wife and i went in to purchase window treatments for our house .
so , why the _num_ star ?
i was busy , so requested another day .
these were n't subtle problems .
but they shipped it out anyway .
huge mistake .
not good .
so disappointed .
they are clueless .
not a wide selection of belly button rings .
i did n't finish anything .
i 'm going to think twice before i go to this store again .
these guys are not easy to deal with .
worse service in town .
nothing special here .
this was my first time here and likely my last .
service was poor .
bar menu was good , appetizers we only okay .
it 's the place you regret going to because you 're completely isolated .
terrible .
all _num_ of our meals were overlooked .
they obviously do n't care .
we finally walked out .
huge disappointment .
this was a bit shocking to me , especially considering the monthly price tag .
it is not yoga by definition .
my dining companion eats here regularly ( why ? )
we met up with a group of people of approximately _num_ people .
the rolls have became really small and prices are not in line either .
i doubt i would go back .
in all honesty , not real memorable .
i 've got nothing .
sushi _num_ , go back to school .
absolutely horrible .
since when did imitation crab become passable as chefs choice sashimi .
i always loved this place ... but damn .
so , the only spot i could remember was sushi _num_ .
and , boy , biggest regret .
the lady that served me was great and quickly submitted my order .
no worries .
it 's not !
too long of a story , but trust me .
they do not care about you .
do not go with this company .
i 'll buy online instead .
burgers were n't bad .
i miss the ciabatta bun burger that had that awesome sauce .
i get that nobody wants to work on christmas day .
at this economy i really wish that people were appreciative to have a job .
i used to come to this location every night after work .
so , a few days ago , i decided to redeem my coupons .
in the past , this has been a very senses oriented experience .
not this gal .
i thought that maybe i should shave my head and start over .
i walked in because i was curious about the curly line .
went to red rocks cafe on christmas eve .
i have been here several times in the past and have left pleased .
last saturday night , though - maybe an off night ?
this place was just ok .
no personality whatsoever .
if you decide to go do n't let her help you .
i had salad and a fillet w/ mashed potatoes .
then my sides got cold .
but this service makes me never want to go there again .
i have been going to red rocks for _num_ years .
i went on saturday night and this will be the last time .
my daughter ( _num_ yrs old ) ordered spinach ravioli with chicken .
what she got was a soup with some ravioli in it .
he apologized and went to the kitchen to get the chicken .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
ten years later we went tonight for a group event .
bland !
at least our steaks were cooked correctly .
the vanilla bean torte for dessert was the only decent thing we ate .
the chocolate cake was the lone highlight of the meal .
just ordered take out .
$ _num_ for approximately _num_ chips .
service is slow !
it is a pretty pricy thai restaurant .
we got the take out pad see ew tonight .
this was a very loose and spicy clear sauce .
the spring rolls were plain but fine .
the soup was clear broth of chicken with rice .
this place is not for you .
the vegetable they used in the noodles were cheap .
bunch of cheap onions and baby corn .
restaurant owner yelled `` we close at _num_ '' .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
overpriced tasteless fake thai food .
service was n't great either .
this place is terrible !
the atmosphere was calming and the staff greeting us was friendly enough .
my last purchase at belk was an expensive bra .
i have visited this belk on several occasions .
this weekend i had a rather odd experience .
the white customer being waited on had a lengthy transaction .
i would suggest you pass on this one .
the salespeople have probably all tuned it out so they just never answer .
no big deal .
this was purchased at a showroom in los angeles .
that was not good customer service !
in one small , closing statement `` this mall has been around since _num_ .
no thanks .
he also left an oil stain on my driver 's side mat .
i pulled up in a lane with only one car ahead of me .
not a real chick-fil-a .
and it was wrong !
i would not recommend this shop .
they are cheap !
they are not professional !
worst customer service ever .
stay away stay away from this place .
the nice girl at the counter took my name .
just an overall unreal experience , from start to finish .
but believe me , they are .
however , would it kill them to actually do their damn jobs ?
so yes , i said , i 'm going to buy the damn string .
what the hell ?
my first fresh market was in south carolina , and it was an oasis .
so does harris teeter .
please bring back curry chicken salad .
terrible customer service !
terrible customer service !
it 's expensive , for one .
not having as many locations means more crowded stores and more videos picked over .
once they noticed it was good coverage they called me in .
Negative
gross !
gross !
gross !
i would not eat here again .
basically ... it 's mall food court pizza .
oddly the cashier over complicated it and made it difficult to split the bill .
this was my second visit .
atmosphere is a big deal for me .
tres tacky .
avoid at all costs !
horrible service .
upholstery was outdated .
unfortunately i was highly disappointed .
best chinese , no .
food does n't match the restaurant 's look and atmosphere .
disappointing .
this place was once the go-to old school chinese place .
food was terrible .
it is like white rice with veggies mixed in .
the lo mein tastes like old noodles soaked in soy sauce .
so , i decided to check them out again .
however , the soup , blah again .
i ordered the chicken and shrimp with mixed veggies for my entre .
i just think the tastes were a little bit off .
if i want some shoes , i 'm going straight here .
i will not be returning .
i was visiting charlotte and decided to check out nordstrom for a hair product .
i will give them another chance because of the great service they usually provide .
i will give them another chance because of the great service they usually provide .
poor customer service .
it might be a bit expensive for you though .
it 's like $ _num_ .
and sesame chicken was basically in a syrup , not a sauce .
got charged for water .
since then , they have incorrectly processed each of my additional mortgage payments .
not a good breakfast choice .
today something is off at phil 's deli .
that 's like charging for ketchup packs .
no shrimp , no squash .
this was a constant complaint from my wife throughout our dinner .
poor service .
rather bland .
i would not recommend this place .
poor food quality .
poor wait staff .
avoid this place .
it 's very pricey for very little portions .
she was as attentive as she could be .
to start , the waiter talked to us a total of _num_ times .
ick !
no explanation .
one really ca n't complain .
he kept our waters full .
for frozen crap ?
are you kidding me ?
but we 're not those people .
very disappointing experience .
based off of the menu i ordered the veal ravioli in butter sage sauce .
no big deal .
)
early sunday morning visit to pick up something for breakfast .
thumbs down on this place .
recommendation , make sure you get things in writing from them .
of course , the appointment was smooth for me to be seen .
i consider the wait for the doctor to be normal .
the eye exam was redone by the doctor - that was professional .
i do not recommend .
this simple eye exam ended up taking _num_ and a half hours .
it tasted nothing like what i was used to having at dairy queen .
so my fianc drove to the south blvd location .
the decor was awful !
i tried the fried oyster salad and there was two crab cakes ordered .
terrible .
i left and will not go back .
never received follow up call or appt .
not a well run business in my opinion .
no call .
the worst .
its so sick .
and its so wrong .
she never diagnosed a problem .
avoid at all costs .
i have never heard that in my life !
the second thing , i never got my temporary card .
it would n't open at all .
i love mac makeup , and i 'm a total makeup junkie .
maybe it 'd be a better place to visit for dinner .
why not just honor the $ _num_ & not lose business ?
stupid .
every dish seems to have something in it to kill the patron .
wine comes , brought by waiter _num_ who is also the bartender .
Positive
that was _num_ months ago .
still no response .
the manager ( ? )
very over rated restaurant .
the prices were very steep and the food was so so .
waste of money .
thanks for nothing .
we felt rushed towards the end .
the ambiance is okay , not exceptional either .
then this same situation happened to the table sitting next to us .
i cant find anything that stands out from a positive aspect .
the place was dead .
simple things like , `` what fruit comes with the french toast ? ''
flavorless and over cooked .
no explanation .
lamb was cold .
probably will not return .
never seen anything like it .
after about a week , the nurse called me with the lab results .
very bad day .
very unhappy !
even the surly teenage kids checking you out , i can deal with .
the parking lot is indeed dangerous with holes , the other reviews are correct .
forgetting a condiment or a special request , okay , but the patty ?
was n't to impressed .
Negative
opened it up and they all _num_ had cheese !
they gave me a stone hard `` grilled '' asiago burger .
it was absolutely ridiculous .
he then responded he would n't continue until i pay .
i have officially washed my hands of them .
worse nail experience ever !
my toes have nail polish all over my skin .
very disappointed tonight .
poor service .
literally , yelled .
`` nothing , '' i replied .
i immediately drove down university city blvd .
uh , no thanks !
however this location is n't too good .
the room itself was clean , and had the usual assortment of items here .
the place is entirely too small .
i ordered filet mignon and chicken combo .
really ?
i tried the sliders and i 'm over it now .
the b & m of this store is fine .
usually easy and smooth to buy , rent , or sell books .
meh is the only way to describe my experience here yesterday .
i ordered the cheeseburger pizza .
so they earned the _num_ stars fair and square .
racist !
been here _num_ times wanting to try their food .
could find better japanese in the area .
i probably should have kept driving .
stale chips .
i get waited on almost immediately and i place my order at fair prices .
_num_ % of the food is going to the drive through window .
more like a stop and wait and wait and wait .
_num_ min wait to be precise !
so , i stopped by here since it was so close .
big mistake .
it was just meh .
the chips and salsa that came with it were meh .
meh , meh , meh .
if you 're in a rush , do n't stop by here .
gross !
if i could give it less than one star i would .
she completely ignored me .
i am a white man , _num_ years old , and disabled .
i will simply never patronize your establishment again .
you should check your reviews on google .
the caesar salad was pretty average , too .
do we need _num_ hostesses for a saturday night ?
much less charge them extra .
mashed potatoes were crusty ?
and then to top it off we had trouble with the bill .
plain jane central .
such a disappointment .
then nothing , absolutely nothing .
this did not make me happy .
terrible service .
terrible food .
terrible drinks .
this was unbelievable .
very bad experience !
my wife and i stopped in on sunday afternoon for lunch .
we will not be back .
there are plenty of other places who would like our money .
diced chicken , bacon , eggs , pico and jalapenos .
my wife and _num_ kids walked in this afternoon .
this has been typical lately at this location .
the bean were mush .
ick .
overall , if i do go back i 'm trying something else .
we asked for a new basket and they were a tiny bit better .
we asked for mild salsa and it came out like tomato juice .
( mixed fajitas with chicken , beef , shrimp , carnitas and chorizo ) .
it was just bad .
they are a new item , beef tips in a burrito .
not awful really .
they were not good .
if only there were biscuits to go with the chile relleno .
the service is horrible .
not to mention the food .
horrible service !
service was extremely disappointing .
someone recommended this place , they said the subs were good .
so it 's not saying much .
the meatball sub tasted as if it came out a can .
also , this place is so over priced .
major fail !
will not go back .
ordered just a philly chicken cheese steak .
chicken had some weird spices in it .
almost seemed like they have the same chicken for the philly and fajita sandwich .
online check-in takes priority over walk-ins .
avoid this place .
this restaurant is better than dim sum on central .
that is not really saying much .
however , they are not .
sad sad sad .
come on , dragon court , i know you 're better than that .
consider this review the first two strikes though .
nasty !
what a horrible experience .
hong kong style should be a balanced combination of ground pork and shrimp .
but the most recent time i went , the service was abysmal .
i would check their restaurant health scores before you decide to eat here .
i finished this review at a different mcdonald 's .
i 'm not to sure , about this one .
its home depot , you 've been there .
i said , it says i need assistance .
she came over and looked at my order and went back to her screen .
horrible customer service !
went back the second time to get it done .
i recently had a vehicle in their shop for a water pump replacement .
i recently had a vehicle in their shop for a water pump replacement .
i went on a tuesday night for their $ _num_ bowling night .
_num_ stars ?
pancakes were dry .
i went to the old hickory house on a saturday afternoon for lunch .
i left very disappointed .
the restaurant was not very busy .
the waitress let me know i could sit anywhere .
for the sides i choose baked beans and hushpuppies .
i tried adding some of the bbq sauce .
the sauce was thin with chunks of onions i think in it .
the taste was okay -- not really overwhelming or remarkable .
everyone had mentioned the `` sketchy '' location .
our bill totaled $ _num_ before a tip .
the food was ready very quickly .
it looked more like a vegetable soup than bbq sauce .
the positives : the hush puppies were amazing .
i 'm just going to leave it up to you .
the atmosphere was like i was eating from the movie fried green tomatoes .
i was thoroughly disappointed .
i arrived at about 6:00 pm and there were just three tables occupied .
when you walk in , you see a big smoker behind a counter .
i had a combo plate with chicken , ribs , and brisket .
they were awful .
i was expecting authentic eastern nc barbeque .
the brisket was a bit tough .
tried all _num_ meats .
especially the bathroom - wash your hands before you go .
i would look for a better bbq , charlotte .
barbecue is only as good as the cuts of meat start with .
ate their brisket last night .
it was n't good at all .
restaurant was pretty dead .
the baked beans also were nice , with some pieces of meat in it .
the decor is like stepping into a diner from the late _num_ 's .
no way !
i was kind enough to not review before but goodness !
the review described my trouble finding it and the lady .
the times i 've eaten here , the food was so-so .
i just do not get it.
i guess bad management .
this rating is for the stylist in the back not the actual store .
they are not professional .
i was quoted a price of _num_ .
when i got home i noticed the sticker had been placed over another .
Positive
just like the whole restaurant .
they should close down , hire new workers or something .
they could be giving pizza away and i would pass .
they also have hanging bbq ducks and roasted pork section along with a bakery .
however , this is more vietnamese and chinese focus .
homeless people on the corners asking for money .
nearly half empty .
while not impressive or particularly flavorful , the food sticks to your ribs .
it seems like fair bet for lunch if i 'm craving diner fare .
i left before i even finished picking out my color !
and you are trying to hurt my business .
when welcomed i was greeted promptly and asked what i needed .
the young woman then continued to try to up sell me to gel polish .
recently changed management .
i miss christina !
i tried everything !
as a disclaimer , i 've only had what i 've mentioned above .
she should know by looking at it .
also , the sirloin my daughter got was cooked properly and very tough .
ive repeatedly had to send back steaks due to over cooking .
big disappointment .
except for the last few times we 've eaten at this location .
and the blooming onion looked as if it had been found under the sea .
but never again would i step foot in here .
by the time i received it , everyone else had finished eating .
just not happy at all .
burn the cottage !
i ordered chicken fried rice and pineapple chicken .
it 's one big room , tables lined up one next to the other .
nothing special .
bathroom was nasty .
age tofu overcooked .
sad sad sad .
i get a thing for sushi and cold japanese beer .
every time , disappointed .
every time after , it has been just okay .
atmosphere is run down .
booths with holes with a warehouse feel .
the quantity of food is less .
i was disappointed .
lol not hard to make a salad though .
just disgusting .
i have n't eaten anything all day .
service was horrible .
one of the low end japanese express style of restaurants in the university area .
and the shrimp tempura tastes like it 's been cooked in beer batter .
i 'm a server myself and you dont rush customers .
the hibachi is mediocre .
i was very disappointed .
even an asian buffet can do better than this .
just so gross .
however , the sushi my friends ordered was pretty good !
this place could really use a remodel on its decor .
it 's not anywhere where i want to stay inside and eat .
i 'd recommend skipping their fried rice .
disgusting !
i was in search of gyoza .
they have gyoza ... that is where it all goes south .
this place has _num_ stars for a reason .
needless to say the gyoza was either steamed or deep fried .
gyoza is pan fried and then steamed .
but all of it is pretty much in plain view .
it 's kind of weird .
really dirty place !
their jumbo shrimp is not jumbo by definition .
my daughter ordered two large regular crust cheese pizzas and i brought them home .
this has been my `` go to '' pizza for _num_ years .
horrible service .
well yelp requires me to choose a star so i chose one .
thee worst !
service is rude and horrible .
but to others , beware .
the stew beef was okay , i guess .
this location is definitely subpar !
slow service .
the fried chicken was okay .
but ... isnt that the case for the good hole in the wall places .
fried chicken was ok .
some reviewers said that it would make me want to slap my mama .
watery and gross .
i realize that some places are a hit or miss .
there was the smell of weed when before i walked through the front door .
it was awful .
not impressed at all .
cheap is definitely how i would describe the food .
worst wendy 's ever .
i ordered apple pecan chicken salad , fries and iced tea .
not clean .
i ordered mine for here and they gave it to me in a bag .
extremely disappointed !
worst .
worst service ever .
i come here often because i live very close .
( yes , this has happened to me ) .
there 's a reason this place has such low ratings .
worst wendy 's .
staff are clueless .
guess which clinic will have my continued business ?
this one is n't .
disappointed .
there were no exhibits .
no old anything .
this is awful .
i was so pissed .
at least then i know it will be cared for & appreciated .
ok , i 'll get off my soap box now .
i stayed here for _num_ nights for business .
i needed my stuff bottom line and before 8am .
stayed here for _num_ nights for business in january with nicole b .
however , that is not what happened .
the clerk said mine would be removed .
we are here for one night with our _num_ month old .
he slept in bed with us and cried all night long .
most seemed like it was an inconvenience for me to be disturbing them .
shame on you marriott .
worst hotel experience ever .
very thin walls and floors .
horrible !
their food is n't all that great .
well drinks are $ _num_ each .
nothing special about the burgers .
this place is just blah .
service : horrible !
unacceptable .
the whole thing just seem like an inconvenience ... for everyone .
the description said ... '' cheesy creamed spinach served with warm chips '' .
nothing remained on the chip .
she did not know the menu .
he got _num_ refills .
dirty interior , poor service .
i went with _num_ of my coworkers .
my coworkers had s philly cheese steak , chili and a fried chicken salad .
it is all typical pub food .
my salad lettuce was wilted .
was in charlotte for business and ate here with a few co - workers .
i also had a glass of there house merlot for $ _num_ .
there is never a manager present .
not good .
the sandwiches are always dry .
do n't be fooled .
this is frustrating .
not a drink or a menu .
i suggest another cab company .
the driver was friendly and polite .
( it was at a 1/4 tank . )
only if i 'm desperate .
service is completely inept .
horrible service !
driver ca n't find my home then takes longest route possible .
there are plenty of other cab companies in charlotte .
i would have and should have walked !
i screamed as i would miss my flight to work .
so i thought i better to use a cab instead of calling friends around .
btw , if these cab drivers hate their work , find another one .
very disappointing service .
so , i needed a ride to the train station .
days in advance , i scheduled a pickup online .
goodbye cabs , hello uber !
i can not express how done i am with this company .
i am sure there is some `` longest route '' feature .
Negative
received confirmation of my order # _num_ and payment .
i now have - $ _num_ in my account !
( more than a month ago the item was received ) .
will not play here again .
the back _num_ seems ten times better .
management , either lower your prices or take care of your course .
the fairways were absolutely rock hard .
if you like hitting off hard pan this is your place .
very little grass to tee off from .
horrible experience .
drove _num_ miles to purchase a membership for my mother-in-law .
i guess sams club has all our future business .
so costco you need to shape up and get your act together !
nothing special .
not particularly polite .
it is a disorganized mess .
total of three trips .
it reminded me that a review was long overdue .
i had to come back _num_ times and numerous calls were made .
basically , my tire pressure button kept on coming on .
stray away from their stores !
i 'm just going to copy and paste my complaint e-mail ... .
got the dough nut but all the stores were closed at this hour .
looked online to find a place that was open on sunday .

total labor and parts would be under $ _num_ .
it was horrible .
it arrives , it is put on and i drive away .
just stupid working there !

inside it just smelled fried .
not quite clean .
this place is not good .
why not just ask the hotel to fix it ?
but still -- rough sauce .
stayed two nights recently and my room stunk of smoke .
_num_ .

_num_ .
mold and mildew .
breakfast is standard choice hotels breakfast every single day .
no change .
shower rod is really loose .

i checked in a hotel near this restaurant and ordered some food for delivery .
i completely hate this hotel .
had problems with this room service option the first two nights i was here .
`` you want to buy a guitar and possibly take lessons ?
customer service here is deplorable .
he gave me lots of attitude and i remained polite through the whole experience .
i was so confused !
i paid for the beginner ' s class for my _num_ week old pup .
also often times the larger dogs terrified my toy breed pup .
i insisted on another class as the policy stated .
the next thing is the grooming dept .
the 1st matter was there were mats under the inside of my pups legs .
her nails were not touched .
fail !
_num_ ) curb appeal of bar is slim to none .
_num_ ) out of the way location - near the airport .
couldnt even think of the 3rd bite .
we did have dessert though , off a huge machine looking cart .
i wish they would serve that as dessert !
for crap food !
for half the price , i would take it but not the full price .
which was the best item out of the _num_ .
it really felt that it came from a grocery store .
anywho thats my _num_ cents .
reservations meant nothing .
it was not .
overpriced and overbearing ... food was plain .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
very disappointing .
_num_ .
the food was so so and very expensive for what we got .
met a co-worker for lunch here one day .
it was horrific .
i mean , horrible !
then , we got bread and olive oil .
what i anticipated was the champagne and sorbet , didnt get it .
didnt get the show when they open up your entrees in front of you .
i ordered the same thing i had last time , to keep it safe .
it was bad .
cold polenta .
horrible service ... .
my boyfriend asked for a sprite again .
oh , and my boyfriend asked for a sprite again .
needless to say he ate a lot of bread ( cold ) .
pizza good size , but too much oil .
the thin and crispy was not .
the stars on this review should come with dipping sauce for these guys .
terrible pizza .
such a disappointment .
pissed me off .
i live _num_ miles from the location .
i hate this walgreens !
it can sometimes seem a little sketchy when shopping inside ... ex .
_num_ .

_num_ .
ridiculous !
just ... do n't .
bad neighborhood .
lazy maintenance workers .
they just stopped coming by the table .
disgusting nasty place .
i didnt ask for any fancy synthetic oil , and it cost $ _num_ !
the other hotels in the area had their shuttles running without trouble .
horrible hotel .
very disappointing .
this year only breads and yogurt .
the pillows were a little on the stiff side , too .
do n't stay here .
bottom line ... keep looking for a different place to stay .
tip : check the bag before you drive away from the window .
would you like to try our hot chocolate today ? ''
worst mcdonalds ever .
ordered a sundae , milk shake , small fry and medium coke .
we just had the rudest experience here .
worst worst worst customer service .
this is the only place they used their card in charlotte .
my dad said he thought something was a bit off .
they started with checking my tire pressure and rotating the tires .
i should probably get in replaced , but its not urgent .
trust the guy with the grease on his hands .
not the one in the pretty blue polo .
it costs _num_ dollars .
no big deal .
nothing special .
very run down .
i stopped to air up my tires .
the sandwich was cold .
he responded again `` members only , you have to know someone '' .
not for you !
Negative
negative _num_ stars .
this place sucks .
very slow .
poor customer service .
each time i go , i think it will be better .
rude !
made a reservation _num_ weeks in advance for a _num_ way from the airport .
i asked that management follow up with me asap .
can not recommend , will not use again .
i asked him to please not throw our bags because these are personal items .
this is just bs ! ''
at the hotel , the whole place smells like a burning tire yard .
my boyfriend and i stayed here one night during our road trip .
the bathrooms are gross .
i got into my room and the room looked clean at least .
make sure to get your pricing in writing .
i was quoted a price to later find out it was twice as much .
not to mention they are _num_ weeks out to do the work .
stayed here while in charlotte for a meeting .
first impressions were not good .
not professional at all .
light over bathroom sink blew out .
hubby had to cover his head so i could stay up late reading .
check out and on our way !
was offered another room but moving out would just be another hassle .
meh , i 've had better .
went here for lunch the other day and the place was packed .
seated right away and was met by the server instantly with chips .
ordered the combo place of tostada , enchilada and taco .
flavors were just ok .
needless to say we are still on the hunt .
the service was very prompt and polite .
same corporate owners and recipes but better staff .
ridiculous .
i guess my azteca days are over .
my dining companion had chicken fajitas , i had the chicken taco salad .
my dining companion had chicken fajitas , i had the chicken taco salad .
so went an ordered tacos to go .

it was nasty nasty nasty .
bathroom horrible condition .
only stopped here because we were in a hurry .
avoid !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
what a mistake !
ended up at this dive because us airways had many people miss flights .
the airline said it would be 30-40 dollars .
ummm no !
overall it is average stay .
it is an extremely stinky motel .
this motel probably just renovated their rooms .
our next stop would be to florida .
smoking so much and i 'm allergic .
after this weekly rental is over i 'm out of here !
the heat that comes out is cold air .
only asks other people if they need any vacuuming .
the patio doors has homemade locks .
i stayed here for a bit over a week .
it is a very sketchy place .
this place sucks .
i can accept cheap prices as long as i feel safe .
not worth the hassle .
i felt strangely out of place by the staff .
very large selection , all very neatly organized .
the staff was terribly rude .
i have n't gone back .
i 'm never going back .
this place is horrible !
we are from new england , which is entirely void of these places .
i walk in and sit down .
we walked in and we were surprised that they had seating available right away .
we told her that we were too cold to stay .
really bad service .
the wednesday lunch buffet was killer and the weekend breakfast buffet was equally awesome .
boring !
this place is pretentious and over priced .
hard to find one to get a dance .
and refused to refund me .
not so much anymore .
they were wrong .
i have tried it several times and just never have been impressed .
this is based off just one visit when i ordered the bbq chicken .
had good flavor and fell right off the bone .
the cheese and butter had separated from the pasta completely .
gross !
i love little local family dives , but this place was a miss .
old and very dry !
salt on salt on salt .
i am more a fan of regular cole slaw .
this was our 2nd time dining here .
so , this is our first time trying a true southern restaurant .
if you are into vinegar style bbq then this is your place .
the sign said $ _num_ .
way hotter than what would come out of the smoker .
the bark was soggy .
i had the rib , chicken combo and a side of baked beans .
last week i was in the area and stopped in for lunch .
i figured how in the world i never heard of this place .
or $ _num_ fried catfish sandwich .
my sides were a lot more natural looking , collard green and cabbage .
my coworkers opted for the complimentary dessert which was peach cobbler .
everything on the menu is either frozen , or comes from a can .
just tried the place because i was close .
chicken pot pie was decent .
fried okra was not that great .
mac and cheese treated like out of a box .
corn bread was ok.
cobbler was mediocre .
we ordered delivery here at work and it was delivered .
the first order i got was the chicken cesar salad in the tortilla shell .
to say my lettuce was drowning in dressing would be an understatement .
a little strip mall sandwich shop with a country cooking feel .
they made no apologies .
bad bad bad !
i left their establishment and went on my weekend trip .
did he offer to change my oil again ?
how dishonest !
the drinks were good but way expensive .
i also purchased a living social to get golfing lessons .
the cheese was n't melted .
yep , they 'd made my order twice .
dumb .
very disappointed !
yeah ... the menu here is a bit random .
sorta like arby 's .
they installed two new h & c in our home _num_ years ago .
keep in mind it 's _num_ degrees outside .
not my previous service company who installed the units less than _num_ yrs .
horrible service .
also , they noted there was an oil leak .
let me say i really like dollar tree .
just disorganized and ridiculous .
i have taken my car in to this location before for new tires .
luckily for me she kindly let me replace my drink with a second side .
perhaps the manager should learn how to read .
long wait for food .
awful experience .
built my own as i usually do , and it comes pretty quickly .
sounds pretty perfect , take out for $ _num_ including delivery and tax !
awkward !
thank god this next time i was only on hold for under a minute .
this experience will deter me from ordering from this location .
starving '' .
if that does n't keep you on your toes , nothing will .
room was large , bathroom was nice .
( i just kept thinking , is it going to cave in ?
Negative
do not stay here .
our room did not smell .
they deserve zero stars !
i find that extremely disturbing .
no please avoid .
avoid !
i travel for business _num_ weeks out of the year .
will not stay at embassy suites ever again .
on-site steakhouse was disappointing .
maybe the second worst ?
the room i stayed in had definitely seen better days .
the bad .
our room had an ac leak .
fast forward to our _num_ minute wait time outside by the hotel shuttles .
unacceptable .
garbage hotel .
makes for a very unwelcome feel .
cornbread , stale .
peaches , canned .
skip this one .
saigon palace is the first vietnamese restaurant i 've eaten at in charlotte .
the spring rolls were decent , as was the dipping sauce .
seriously , _num_ star rating .
boy was i wrong .
let me break it down for ya .
expensive as hell .
_num_ for a regular ?
this was hands down the best thing we ate .
my _num_ year old son loves pho but with broth and noodles only .
i will stop at wendy 's before i go back to this place .
it did n't look clean .
the pho is mediocre .
rude !
he comes back and slides the little cup of chili on the table .
rude !
then the table next to us gets potatoes .
then a crazy amount of time to get our credit card back .
worst restaurant ever .
all for only an $ _num_ price tag .
no bread included complimentary .
unsure how they are still in business .
an hour later still nothing .
he was joined by our true waiter at this time so he backed off .
and walked away .
disappointed !
hubby done with his dinner , wine bottle finished .
ok , this seemed a bit pricey but reasonable .
i went inside and explained that i needed them to check the pressure .
unreal .
there was coolant steaming all over the engine .
my car had a few problems , sure what car does n't ?
people just sitting in the shop doing nothing .
_num_ .

i ended up with _num_ full bottles left over and _num_ half bottles .
lack of customer service .
on the weekends , this place is crazy .
people are packed in here , and parking becomes quite difficult .
the only place i really appreciate is the vintage clothing .
i will not be going back .
it was terrible .
they just got an _num_ grade .
no longer a customer .
i 've been eating here for years , through the second owner .
this place here ... ummmm not so much .
bad customer service too .
nothing like a northern deli shop .
first time getting gel nails was this past saturday .
then the next day it split open .
$ _num_ for this ?
waste of money .
horrible experience !
is n't that nail school _num_ ?
horrible .
they are not competent nail technicians .
awful awful awful !
total nightmare .
with ketchup for sauce ) small portions and cheap ingredients .
gives a whole new meaning to cheap chinese .

the rangoons and dumplings were pretty decent .
Positive

needless to say , i was sold !
very bad food .

it was terrible .
i 've exhausted my attempts .
i will not eat here again .
do n't bother .
my wife cooks indian food , she grew up in india .
after this visit , i had to share with yelp .
ordered delivery to hotel .
it was nasty .
i chose the buffet because i wanted some vegetables .
if i go back , i should probably choose from the menu .
she had baked chicken , i the fried chicken .
fried chicken , fried shrimp , fried tilapia , fried catfish .
i stopped in for a late lunch .
the service was lacking .
overall , i think this place does southern fried soul fairly well .
pasta salad was nothing special .
i 'm pretty sure my fried chicken is better .
i 'd probably go back for lunch .
however , everything is else is average .
horrible !
i was soooo wrong !
i 've had much better fried chicken at bojangles down the street .
i will not come back .
the couch bed was full of springs and cover !
the manager , michael is not a people person .
i ended up only staying for a week at this extended type of hotel .
i checked out the room before i accepted it .
then the a/c and heater unit .
the floor tile was ordered and took almost a month to be delivered .
_num_ star is too many .
they were not helpful at all .
one week later , get a call to come get the car .
you hire incompetent people .
so disappointed .
i would n't even give one star .
ended up having to buy a new with my own money .
make sure you order your pizza _num_ hours before you want it .
( i didnt have my car that evening ) .
this is not authentic chinese food .
the mix of flavors with the vegetables is very off .
the only item that was passable was the orange chicken .
the second star is just for effort and not being overly salty .
my wife and daughter ordered sesame chicken a few days ago .
i regret going here , never again !
ok things happen , i understand .
be very careful .
the hamburger was dry .
very poor !
i left without getting anything .

_num_ .
total nightmare .
horrible sales staff .
there were more salespeople than customers .
these guys are clueless .
service , staff were all top notch .
it 's too bad .
but , it really was more of a dessert than a side dish .
like , maybe the best i 've ever had !
the prices are low .
the decor is horrible .
just a select few .
no more creamy texture .
disappointed .
very plain .
if you like sweet cream with food coloring , this is your place .
cheap greedy owners alert !
very over priced and portions are very small .
it was crazy , and i wish they would fix this .
i mean it is fast food .
i purchased a few things two i was very excited for .
hummus and my boyfriends fave - red velvet cake .
no biggie .
-no prices on the ground turkey ( about 10-15 packs ) .
went and got the $ _num_ box of tenders .
took pictures to send to corporate .
there 's a bolt sticking in my tire .
just have your sister call and make another appointment . ''
the facility itself looks like it was built _num_ years ago and never renovated .
i could go on , but i think you get the point .
it was steamed vegetables on top rice !
no teriyaki sauce .
finally , the egg rolls ( vegetable ) .
disgusting .
poor customer service .
seems like the wait staff needs help and the kitchen as well .
crap , crap , crap .
i trust chad 's reviews but i neglected to take the date into consideration .
for the second plate , i tried some others .
in the ice cream case was a sliced pecan pie .
cheap buffet eats .
gel polish should not do that .
i 'm so disappointed .
worst nail service ever !
my top over coat is not smooth .
she filed me so hard she cut me deep .
this place is terrible .
checked the reviews here and was excited about checking it out .
service is bad .
avoid their restrooms .
when the food came , i must say that it looked delicious .
indian lady at counter ...
and for the record , my wife is indian .
then the original waiter came over and apologized for forgetting about my order .
i refused .
are you kidding me ?
no acknowledgement , nothing .
will not go here .
dead and alive !
not a customer friendly restaurant .
limited quantity .
had to wait _num_ mins for bill .

he gave us a free cheese dip to try and calm the waters .
i could keep typing , but i wont , for now .
the glass next to our booth was covered in greasy hand prints .
slow service .
cold food .
at yesterday 's visit our queso was so thick it broke the chips .
i 'll be calling wells fargo .

horrible , liars !
ive been a bank of america customer for over _num_ years .

so friday , i came for a repair .
i do not recommend .
this was my second visit to v nails .
when i first move to charlotte _num_ years ago this apartment complex was great .
the leading company did nothing .
not worth it .
take your money elsewhere .
huge turnover in office and they never care or follow up with anything .
horrible breakfast .
just nasty !
food tasted ok .
i can not speak to the quality of the course or clubhouse .
typical chinese restaurant .
the food was awful .
do not stop here .
my boyfriend and i came through the drive thru at around _num_ pm .
terrible !
terrible .
sorry not sorry !

its a rip off .
worst pizza hut .
the wait time was crazy .
worst customer experience ever !
terrible customer service !
a two hour delivery wait for one pizza and an order of wings !
not even super bowl sunday !
i always choose pizza hut over dominos until i ordered from this one .
this is the worst !
i understand that it was going to take longer than normal , ok .
we were very excited to try the new flavors with the pizza .
terrible customer service !
Negative
just avoid going here .
this location is very busy .
tried pizza hut again today .
get your shit together management .
zero stars .
not cool !
my burritos were not even hot .
it was mostly vanilla with a little bit of coke flavor .
it was dirty and gross .
there was a short wait but nothing too crazy .
this particular visit was nothing close to that .
i do n't stray from my favorites .
i went through the drive-thru and the lady had a difficult time hearing me .
so by this time , i am livid .
as a customer , i just wanted to ensure that she heard me correctly .
maybe i just expect too much .
not again .
service is virtually non-existent .
the atm machine looks like it would steal your pin number .
terrible service !
certainly not the best hilton property i 've ever visited .
needless to say , i accepted .
this is a beat up hilton garden inn .
bad layout etc .
this needs to be a something other than a hilton garden inn .
i had to wash my little ones with my hands and soap .
the wifi is horrible !
the two times i made telephone orders both girls had major attitude problems .
if you do n't like your job , then quit .
horrible experience .
i would not recommend this establishment .
worst management staff ever !
do not eat here .
it is awful !
really bad .
i will not be traveling across town anymore .
one woman was hostess , server and cashier for the entire place .
no professionalism .
never going back .
this was my first trip to this restaurant .
it was bland .
service was extremely slow .
i only like this place because i grew up with it in ohio .
they are sooo slow .
this place is a joke .
worst car wash ever !
ps .
slow !
its close , its cheap , and i like `` chinese '' food .
only stayed due to time for my lunch .
not worth the risk .
worst service ever !
bad choice !
i also asked for _num_ minor stains to be removed .
horrible service .
spend your money elsewhere !
horrid conditions .
we played _num_ holes today and was my first and probably last visit .
( photo below ) .
this course is awful .
the greens were atrocious .
the new management is not `` dog friendly '' like the previous owner .
i would steer clear of this apartment complex .
)
maybe it 's time for me to stop eating out .
$ _num_ for a large .
no big deal .
it 's just strawberry right ?
no ... .
they gave it to me with cream and sugar .
it 's always down does n't matter what time you come here after 8pm .
2am after the bar , it 's being cleaned .
first , this place is totally overpriced for what it is .
you can get a salad at any other restaurant for less than this .
gross .
i 'm assuming that they chop it up in store .
there is also a selection of pre-made pasta salad , potato salad , etc .
i get to the location , pay for my order and wait .
i placed the order _num_ hours early online .
they seem to always forget my salad dressing whenever i get takeout .
nice way to run a `` fast food '' joint .
very unnecessary when you are just trying to pickup food .
i would much rather use the harris teeter right down the road .
just dont go here .
trust me , just another notch from your local places .
the garlic knots , however , were actually good .
the slices were underwhelming .
what a major disappointment !
basically told us to go by 8:30 cause tonight they 're closing early .
they were just going to spray the room since they were sold out .
time to upgrade , marriott .
extremely frustrating .
long wait wrong order .
not a place i can recommend .
i think they had a new person on the phones tonight !
totally wrong !
$ _num_ plus two $ _num_ tips for one pizza and a small brownie ?
i also asked for a bath on wednesday .
i looked more closely and saw that his eye was very , very red .
i do n't need my sink disconnected .
only been here twice , both times through the drive-through .
not some zombie staffed fast food chain .
very unorganized staff .
i will not be back .
ok this is a confusing review for me to write .
wing king would probably be way more successful with an entirely new wait staff .
very disappointed this time .
regardless , i corrected my rating to reflect wing king .
get some manners and learn how to serve all of your customers .
beware of this charge .
no thanks .
when i arrived , the place was in tip top shape !
i mean , everything was clean , in order , etc .
the worst sushi ever !
customer service is horrible .
ridiculous .
walked in .
no customers .
terrible service .
ca n't say anything positive about this location .
wo n't be returning .
i ordered the breakfast special , a typical eggs , meat , bread combo .
the eggs were okay ( hard to screw up scrambled eggs ) .
the food was lackluster .
you could taste more egg than cheese in the macaroni and cheese .
poor customer service .
the food was n't that good .
very bland .
their room 's light was very dim .
our youngest son put the mattress on the floor so he could sleep .
it 's a crazy place to have a smoking area is you ask me .
bagels , mini muffins , yogurt , and dried cereal .
they claimed my priceline reservation was for a single handicap room .
needless to say .
sorry , wal-mart .
waiting for registers is always hit or miss .
waste .
ugh .
i live my life on fruits .
i hate it.
poor customer service !
wrong !
terrible customer service .
worst walmart ever !
the meat section isnt that much better .
our girls stayed here two nights for a volleyball tournament .
i 've had issues with this particular auto bell recently , though .
much friendlier staff there , too , in my opinion .
vacuuming was barely done .
the worst service ever !
i would not recommend this place !
this is just disrespectful !
i went today and now i remember why i quit going .
very annoying !
when another attendant gave me my car back the poop was still there .
i have a black car it 's not hard to notice it .
overpriced car wash !
very bad service .
wrong !
rude , rude , rude .
both times we went there we stayed up to _num_ hrs .
i reached out to the rep .
lastly , i want to address the two clowns on the larry jay commercial .
not overdone like so many other places .
also , you have to get a milkshake .
the worst !
its was ok , nothing special .
do not go later at night .
are you freaking kidding me ?
ca n't wait to get the new mattress tomorrow !
horrible !
extremely slow service .
unacceptable .
not particularly smart in terms of profit or customer service .
horrible service !
poor customer service .
worst experience ever !
last week , i purchased a dining room set .
horrible !
they were trying to save energy by only having one lamp on !
very unprofessional and rude .
apparently lisa at baskin robbins can .
please do n't scratch your head and then touch my food .
i 'm very unhappy .
saturday mornings are busy .
)
basically anything pre made and fried like crab rangoons etc .
they sound bored and uninterested .
he does n't know .
did you get lost ?
stopped in here for dinner a couple of weeks back .
same basic quality of food with a friendlier waitstaff and less sketchy clientele .
but tonight we had to go and pay close attention to everything .
nothing surprising there .
shitty beer selection but i already knew that .
for the appetizer we chose the corn guacamole .
they just suck .
once we walked in the door i remembered why .
the kicker was the wait staff .
worst .
late craving for the family on new year 's day .
your performance also is taken into consideration .
so much for running in and grabbing a bite .
i was annoyed !
very unfriendly and rude .
bad attitude !
poor for a chain !
food was average chain , service and atmosphere suck .
table of _num_ and everybody had complaints about their food .
i did however like the vegetable spring rolls , however they were pretty greasy .
clean inside , and nice bathrooms though .
poor service and mediocre food .
won ton soup waaaay too salty , chicken fried rice and crab wontons passable .
probably will not return .
but yelp is n't having any of that .
hey owners , what ever he wants in pay , pay it !
i 'll get another stylist next time .
both the technician and the nurse practitioner made me feel like quite the inconvenience .
do not patronize this location .
so , i did n't .
wait staff was polite .
it 's a very standard casual dining .
i had a turkey cheese burger which was okay .
here 's where i take off the third star .

the staff was not organized !
it was total chaos .
this located is always chaotic .
my wife and i visited john 's family restaurant for dinner tonight .
the pumpkin pie was a little salty but good .
overall , we will probably go back but will try other things .
they are located in a questionable part of town .
we ate , checked out , and went on our way .
no such luck !
i almost walked by the area b/c it was so small .
surely , charlotte has more ladies of size like rock hill does .
but now they 've priced themselves out of my budget .
very poor customer service .
i purchased a product there and used a discount coupon .
good thing ... .
buy buy baby is at the same shopping area .
zero stars .
worst service ever .
obviously nobody cared about customer service at all .
i never write reviews and stuff but this was just insane .
needless to say i was done .
Negative

do you remember what your college cafeteria 's buffet style food taste like ?
the lasagna is so hard it is like a brick .
neither of these occurred .
disappointing food selection .

worst buffet in charlotte .
the pizza was dry .

plus you get to pump your own `` butter '' on your popcorn .
the manager confirmed there was an issue and was being worked .
a friend and i stopped by the hotel for a bite by the pool .
the spa pool should be separate than the one guests of the hotel use .
annoying .
the lunch was disgusting .
it was very chaotic , very crowded and felt like a generic chain .

clearly this owner needs to learn how to treat customers .
i would not recommend this practice .
front office staff not the most professional .
it 's never as clean as you 'd do it .

they have wheat grass shots too and offer all around much healthier options .
.
fail !
they did n't care .
taking my business elsewhere .
i went to the verizon store to get it exchanged for a new one .
the stromboli was probably over a foot long and it was gigantic .
the white pizza is my fave so far .
i live about _num_ miles away and its never a problem .
fail .
ended up just throwing them away .
do n't let the name change fool you .
this an absolutely ridiculous excuse !
to which i asked him to go find out .
not a great experience - and ca n't say i 'll ever be back .
poor service , worse food .
it was also very hectic and noisy .
what a disappointed .
i want my money back !
our server seemed in a rush for us to finish and leave .
definately not coming back .
never going to another chick-fil-a !
apparently the owner is n't checking procedures .
half time it is n't done .
why is it a problem for me ?
i am loyal customer but i will leave soon if things do n't change .
they had a deal of buy _num_ tires get _num_ free .
would n't go back ever .
i went in for a _num_ oil change and they never changed he oil .
so a day later i went under the hood to check the oil .

the woman in particular really has a problem dealing with the public .
this place stinks !
i am a big fan of greek food .
the gyros was a processed , almost spam like tasting gyros .
but the past few months the service has become a real problem .
too many teenagers , not enough adults .
very disappointing .
busy place .
i had the gyro platter and dh had the gyro and pork kabob platter .
will not go again .
i am very disappointed .
i am beyond pissed .
it 's not great .
poorly run and mediocre food .
its a little pricey , but you have to think location .
the place was packed on sunday for lunch .
anyway , the grilled chicken came steaming hot and with barbeque sauce .
i would not recommend going here .
it 's not even fair .
ugh .
unacceptable .
run away .
there are far more quality chinese restaurants at much cheaper prices .
my salad was a bit smaller than hers .
wife ( vegetarian ) got the mixed vegetables with brown sauce .

i 'm quite disappoint at my experience here today .
the store is nice though , clean and organized .
what a shame !
it was n't even _num_ yet !
it was just ok .
nothing to write home about .
garlic bread was served and it was salty and the garlic flavoring was overpowering .

typical southern italian food .
did n't find it here .
the food was marginal .
i did not eat it .
wo n't be back .
i will not be back .
the styling was terrible .
it was a straight _num_ minute haircut .
the hair was simply blow dried .

, they would n't honor it .
the lunch menu looked cheaper and i might try this place again .
salsa - tomatoes , onions and cilantro .
)
returned on a week night after we had a great experience several weeks back .
service was horrible .
the only decent part were the chips and salsa .
one fish , one chicken , and one beef .
my mom ordered the same thing except with crispy taco shells .
zero flavor !
it was horrible !
the gallon of salt in the wound = the bill !
my husband , son & i went there for dinner .
this time was a bit different though .
$ _num_ for a sandwich only .
it was not worth it .
their cheesecake is authentic ( flown in from nyc ? )
i make a better pastrami or reuben at home !
doubt i 'll be back .
disappointing .
bread was too thin .
owners changed last year and it is now only fair .
three tables waiting to order and two , including ours waiting for menus .
someone ( not from nyc ) told me to go here .
my gf and i split plates to try both .
in hopes of finding a decent deli we tried this spot for lunch .
he noticed it too and told me to tell the server .
just ordered matzo ball soup .
after your comments i will gladly be back .
management is not customer oriented .
weekends - worse .
zero stars !
not so much .
little dough covering the ( small amount ) of pork filling .
they never stood a chance .
worst food .

horrible place .

it was bland .
i normally eat 3-4 of these , but ate one and was done .
that bad .
the chicken dish was fine .
i felt ripped off .
big disappointment .
i will not be coming back .
just went tonight and the same girl waited on my family .
there was also a roach running around the front door as we walked up .
never once did i have an ok experience there .
terrible first impression .
she only cares about your money .
horrible first impression .
i 'm looking for another vet and groomer .
same day service is a normal service for dry cleaners .
i was promised a suit and shirt cleaned and pressed by 5pm today .
you are wrong !
i do n't like your attitude !
no towels !
charlotte needs a real cajun restaurant .
usual wait wait wait & wait .
trust me , way overpriced .
really left us hanging .
however , the collard greens and mac n cheese were quite good .
waste our money .
first the house style chips came to the table burn .
my wife is from new orleans so we know how the food should taste .
you been warned .
it is what it is i guess .
not impressed .
would not recommend !
horrible !
will not be returning !
overall it was an ok meal , but i 've had a lot better .
the server quickly took it away and was very nice .
i ordered the blackened tuna , smothered cabbage , and cucumber salad .
i also washed off the back window myself .
next you pull around to the vacuum and get out .
that was disappointing .
do n't recommend .
i should n't have to .
please do n't fall for this place .
the food was awful .
the manager returned , and offered another , new salad .
the sides were uninspired .
not very tasty though .
disappointing beer selection .
the lemonade was awful .
but they gave us a really long skinny fork that was more like chopsticks .
it was too much .
this was our first visit to firebirds .
when my plate arrived , they had served me a ny strip .
the place was loud .
it is over priced .
wife and i ate here for lunch the other day and it was so-so .
it looks like it should be much better .
i had the ribs and they came out extremely charred .
the food was lacking .
very disappointing .
not fast -- but friendly .
my husband and i had visited before .
the salad was positively coated in dressing .
try the firebirds on sharon road in southpark .
bad experience .
after almost _num_ min .
worst customer service ever .
i have been here twice .
not relaxing at all !
i said `` forget it '' and walked out .
nothing overly unique , it felt like a typical , higher end steakhouse .
the waiter brought out wine glasses for the table .
our table ordered the coconut shrimp and shrimp cocktail for appetizers .
i really was n't that impressed .
all left angry and disgusted .
just ok .
mashed potatoes seem like baked potatoes that are mashed .

my dad and i went to this location to buy a chest freezer today .
there 's only one person that can get a freezer down ?
ridiculous !
forget meeting with any privacy at all .
the service alone brings the rating down to _num_ .
order the lobster ravioli and it tastes like fish sticks .
order the mushroom ravioli and it comes out like a plate of hot stew .
very disappointing .
my boyfriend and i walked in and were seated almost immediately .
rating is _num_ % !
will not be going back again .
will not go back .
overall very disappointed .
i noticed the difference in my account _num_ days later .
the food was low quality .
just to be clear , i love macaroni grill 's chicken parm .
same waitress ordered the same thing .
a horrible dining experience !
it 's obvious it say and they reheated it .
not so anymore .
it also helps that staples is nowhere near our house .
never once apologized or seemed to remotely care .
i called in a prescription early to be picked up several days later .
unbelievable bad service !
that 's _num_ % of the time !
i did contact them and they refunded me the $ _num_ .
so i explained they did have them and call them a hoagie .
terrible pizza .
smells and tastes like dominos .
not worth the money .
horrible customer service !
props , though , to the staff , which is very attentive .
the salads my dad got were pretty good , considering .
will not return for a while .
same poor quality .
very disappointing .
literally the worst .
no receptionist .
it took a month to get my check from my closing .
fast forward _num_ hours .
they have some new stuff and some estate stuff .
no one !
poor customer service .
all around terrible company .
everyone hates going but we have to go .
that stinks .
personally the dentist is ok i guess .
it seems like his treatment is all driven around the insurance and costs etc .
this was the worst .
service was horrible .
i do n't remember having exceptional service there either .
sloppy .
again , bland and disappointing .
ugh .
i will not be back .
bad experience .
it was just ridiculous .
you will hate yourself for ordering that .
came here for saturday brunch .
breakfast wrap was mostly scrambled eggs , not a lot of flavor at all .
the waitress brought me shrimp and grits .
this was _num_ pm .
waited _num_ minutes .
it started out poorly .
rude staff .
not the case here ... they will run you off the course .
never play golf at this place .
all signs that the place is generally not maintained .
oh my god , the golf carts ... .
in terms of ambiance , it 's a very large and somewhat noisy place .
all kids meals are fried except the pasta marinara .
no substitutions .
they have several options and you can pick _num_ , pick _num_ , etc .
it looks like your sitting on the inside of a elementary school gym .
to sum it all up : quantity over quality .
i have been excited to check this place out for months .
the scoop was only used to fill pitchers .
i 'll stick with takeout or patronize the location on monroe rd .
the platters were just ok .
it 's awful .
her response was they open back at _num_ : pm .
words can not really describe the lunch buffet .
_num_ pieces of fries .
just awful .
no one was around .
the reason why they are n't getting _num_ stars is because of the service .
it was hard to watch .
she just did n't get it .
poor thing .
yet when someone else approached the window they instantly took their order !
never enough staff .
i 've watch grass grow faster than they make the food here .
but their response was even more unbelievable !
rude customer service .
however , not apologetic at all .
average oil change place .
no thanks .
skip this sketchy place .
so maybe this place is a hit or miss ?
nothing like it used to be .
i was hoping to antiques and it seemed like everyone had the same stuff .
did my biscuit come out promptly ?
they seem to be a little skimpy with the food too .
i only stop here because it 's on the way home .
much prefer jersey mike 's though .
pharmacy service not good .
done with this pharmacy .
this is ridiculous .
it is not cheap by any means .
this was n't the case here .
this was our first time trying this place .
( i am sorry !
just no good .
avoid at all cost !
we stopped over the weekend for lunch .
so our food got cold really quickly .
not a fan .
greasy and flavorless .
no thanks .
i may give it another try , but i agree that madison deserves better .
oh such a disappointment .
i ended up with grilled salmon which was very salty .
oh it was horrible .
there was one small problem : the food .
in all , the room was clean and decorated by 5:30 .
very disappointing .
service was really mediocre .
my entree was disappointing .
generic italian chain .
lasagna is meh , ravioli was probably frozen .
i would not come back here .
when we got the meals , the steaks were decent .
this one is bad !
ok , would be nice if u explained why .
i can only assume soup is n't served until later .
my smoothie was finished mixing but needed to be poured into a cup .
worst panera ever !
the cats are kept in an upstairs room above the grooming area .
i was house sitting for some friends of mine , including their two dogs .
on sundays , the drop off times are very tight .
the check-in process was very quick and painless .
i will not be going back .
toilet did n't work .
sink did n't work .
from there , the mirage took off .
they are flavored like curly fries , but with twice the seasoning .
extremely rude mexican staff !
i am very dissapointed .
poor staff .
prices at kfc are getting outrageous .
i have been to this kfc more than _num_ times .
if you need to `` go '' , `` go '' some place else .
_num_ pm .
then i once wanted lettuce on my hamburger and they forgot .
they did n't have any flavor .
looking for the best cheese curds the the old fashion in madison .
the custard was nothing out of the ordinary .
service prompt , impersonal .
on move out day , the crew was late .
after arriving in ny , i called to check on the final price .
no such luck .
finally , i get a call from a driver .
worst car wash ever !
absolutely would not recommend .
the bar is not stocked with much .
hamburger was cold .
french fries were mushy .
will not be returning .
not helpful .
beer order too !
this is not a hard roll .
a hard roll has a hard exterior , much like french bread .
also , do n't expect a real plate .
worst .
the food lacked seasoning .
worst carwash ever .
i had the turkey melt , which again was nothing great .
would not come back .
they should be better prepared for a friday night to accommodate larger crowds .
my friend and i were immediately greeted and taken to a table .
was very cold inside .
was just really weird !
that side of the restaurant needs repairs and lots of upgrades .
)
looked exactly like mine except with spaghetti .
also , sometimes , you just someone to cook your spaghetti for you !
i ordered the lasagna , garlic bread and a glass of chianti .
the lasagna had a nice cheesy toasted top .
zero flavor whatsoever .
and then there was the hair in my baked potato ... .
and the prime rib night was awesome .
it is absolute crap .
i never finished half of the plate .
terrible .
im from nyc this place was definitely subpar .
but reading reviews , people are speaking better of the place .
yuck !
overall rating : f .
lots of pastries and cakes , but nothing spectacular .
know what you are going to get .
eggs benedict were decent .
although the brunch is quite extensive , it is rather pricey at $ _num_ .
wait times were long for both our drinks and food .
not worth it .
you 've been warned !
so very rude !
that was weird .
strangely , it comes with a little side cup of chocolate chip cookie dough .
my husband had a massive cheeseburger , which he loved .
they leave some skin on and use a lot of salt .
ok , no problem .
everything else appeared to have been purchased frozen from sam 's club .
i have gone to this restaurant many times in my life .
gross and weird !
slow and horrible .
horrible food .
shrimp extremely overcooked .
side of vegetable was clearly a frozen vegetable mix .
not worth the $ _num_ .
would only go back for drinks to sit outside and listen to the band .
first , it is a generously set buffet .
bacon , sausage , turkey , mashed potatoes and eggs continental .
there was no description .
the turkey was all shaped the same .
the clam chowder looked old .
i did not even attempt .
i settled for their ( i believe ) orange popcorn shrimp as an app .
for my entree , i order the crispy chicken sandwich .
pathetic .
considering it cost $ _num_ , you better cook to impress .
the decor is awful !
the food was not good .
small diced flavorless chicken .
simply disappointing .
the best part is the cookie dough and the ambiance .
i am only going back for drinks and music in the future .
within a course of _num_ or so months , we returned _num_ times .
i 've been coming here for 20+ yrs and its hit rock bottom .
it is that bad .
the first time it was yellow , second was red , third was pink .
very weird .
horrible .
worst .
we also ordered cheese curds .
really good service too , just wish that the food was better .
do n't ignore us because you know you have messed up .
terrible customer service .
do not bother !
pizza hut fails to deliver on all three aspects .
think ragu spaghetti sauce .
the restaurant is showing its age and really needs an update .
something always goes wrong !
we would not go back .
very affordable , but you get what you pay for .
waitress are not to personable .
she had incredibly long research session about what groupon is .
stopped there for a small family get together around 11am .
big turn off .
i ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs .
it was gross .
wo n't be back .
( madison ) in spring of _num_ .
are you freaking kidding me ?
i live _num_ miles away .
_num_ miles .
_num_ minutes .
i appreciate the thought , but i wish he 'd lose this number .
do n't promise what you ca n't deliver .
i live _num_ miles away .
wrong question .
it was cold .
extremely poor service !
do you like a little food with your grease ?
gross !
absolute joke .
i just opened my business the 1st of september .
you 've been warned .
there was a problem .
i felt awful .
i am not dumb .
my husband also drives my car .
it is embarrassing to be spoken to like i am an in idiot .
so long story short .
very slow service .
i 'm sure they must be short staffed .
also , the whole dish came swimming in a bowl of sauce .
the mashed potatoes were grey and lumpy .
we will not be going back .
try to find spaghetti and meatballs at an italian restaurant in italy .
i could n't resist .
pretentious .
* price : too high .
could get better food at lower prices around the capitol area .
this place is hit or miss , and seems to be a miss recently .
they also messed up the seating arrangements for a large party .
this place sucks .
i 'll never visit this dump again .
our waitress was never around and we got a table cold in the corner .
this place is dismal .
our food was served by the bartender , which was really strange .
my partner and i went for the dinner for _num_ deal .
i ordered the caesar salad with salmon and my date had pasta and meatballs .
_num_ stars before , now only a _num_ .
it sucked .
ugh , the pressure !
stopped at starbucks again .
in fact , we had to hunt down our server for the check .
i found out they booked another party for our table _num_ hours before us .
the server proceeds to tell us the specials .
holy crap !
the waiter was rude .
)
very busy and noisy on a football weekend .
my major problem with them is their management .
too small .
too crowded .
i then screamed back my order again .
hire some bartenders who know how to treat people .
first off they are overpriced .
the other shop checked the warehouse immediately and had it shipped the same day .
there was little that was subtle about the dish .
i 've had my fair share of dining and i 'm also a farmer .
when i read through the menu , nothing really sounded too appetizing to me .
that made the dish and every bite interesting .
not worth it .
c'mon , madison , i know you 've got more than this ?
no depth of flavor whatsoever .
$ _num_ rib eye - lots of fat .
six or seven full courses spread out over _num_ and a half hours .
portions are ridiculously small because they are a taste .
the staff was super stiff and overly formal .
disgusting .
it was nicer than jeans and i 'm glad we dressed up .
if we both got the halibut , this review would be very different .
portion for both the food and wine are very small .
which is exactly what i did tonight .
these people make whole foods look cheap .
very disappointing !
)
just $ _num_ for all this ?
for produce , local farmers markets and freeze a bunch for winter .
having said that , i am vegetarian , and try to eat organic .
there are even folks playing music on the `` street '' outside .
the service is lacking .
bad haircut .
too much product .
no thanks .
so i just walked out .
really awful experience here .
it was going ok until she tried cutting my bangs .
it was horrible !
we went for friday fish fry tonight .
soup salads sandwiches and wraps .
no dinners .
nothing special .
it was bad .
we went for friday fish fry tonight .
soup salads sandwiches and wraps .
no dinners .
nothing special .
it was bad .
just , no .
bouncer : really , for this place ?
it was a cheap ring that snapped about two weeks later .
so we just sat and talked and picked at the appetizer .
i 've been a waitress before .
hardly any spice .
probably would not go back though .
worst service in town .
_num_ star rating i previously considered was shot .
do n't expect good or even polite service .
drinks i thought were overpriced .
i recently went there on a thursday night with a group of _num_ .
what an utter disappointment .
a party of _num_ , my husband , his mother and myself .
not even close .
it 's too bad .
overall the food seemed over-priced and the quaint atmosphere only goes so far .
hop over to marigold 's down the block for the real deal .
the day i went was like _num_ degrees so um yeah .
deserts are not good .
so disappointed .
no thank you .
not here .
it looks like my _num_ year old grandmother did it .
really disappointing !
in the meantime , i 'll try david 's .
omg ... the food is _num_ % american and _num_ % jamaican !
i was very disappointed .
the styrofoam box in which the food came was dripping with oil .
the rice and beans and accompanying potatoes were more of the same .
the service was friendly if not always attentive .
the rest was disappointing .
so i switched to a veggie patty and bbq chicken .
my companions ordered mango rundown tofu and jerk chicken .
the bbq chicken was good , but nothing particularly amazing .
look , i can understand restaurant staff wanting to close up and go home .
just do n't seat me .
no thanks .
but in sum total , the experience was a let down .
i was so hoping this late night gyro would be fantastic .
bad service .
very dirty place .
gross bathrooms .
ick .
have you people ever tasted a gyro before ?
overall , nothing i 'm very excited to try again .
seems a bit pricey to me , but i needed my gyro fix .
in addition , the sauce is really tart .
otherwise , skip it .
gross .
went to have gyro as i have never had it before .
customer service is also not the best .
also i think it is a bit pricey for the food i get .
they also had a slightly bitter taste , which i do n't previously recall .
rather skimp on the meet than anything else .
$ _num_ for guacamole ?
after moving here almost _num_ years ago , we 've eaten here several times .
very disappointed .
no plantains .
nothing like my parents remembered it to be .
beer battered fish fry .
served with white rice , black beans , potato medallions & mango slaw .
well , someone else 's bill .
food was a bit cold .
food was ok.
air conditioning not strong .
Very negative
but no apology .
no nothing .
you can not beat the location .
chicken was good though .
service terrible .
you those restaurants that just use really subpar ingredients for everything ?
the chips are topped with pickled veggies and sprinkled with spices .
the falafel sandwich was cold .
avoid , avoid , avoid .
it is trash .
turnaround seems to be pretty quick and efficient though .
the exclusive company has a better cd selection .
i would recommend elsewhere .
it was tuesday night only few tables occupied .
the price is expensive , the portion is so little .
Positive
it 's _num_ and your restaurant is on the busiest street in madison .
a petite ( _num_ oz . )
it was n't interesting .
i 've picked up better scallops at the co-op , and cheaper too !
we were deeply disappointed .
very disappointing meal .
this includes not delivering our drinks , bread , or food .
as mentioned , the fritters were the highlight of our meal .
for the price of the meal , the food came up way short !
would not recommend this place .
been coming here for _num_ years as a hotel patron .
i really miss mary the former bartender .
wines by the glass are cheap brands at high price .
i 'm convinced the ice they use is made of frozen tears .
it was hard as a rock .
i was expecting a lot better .
the upstairs restaurant looks over the main pedestrian stroll , downtown madison .
the quiche was almonds and broccoli .
the burrito was sausage and potatoes .
just plain .
not cool .
skip .
they need a new recipe , i think .
the reason i rate this low is because of the service .
_num_ .
after a long wait , my food was taken back .
_num_ .

Neutral
too bad ... .
it 's not bad .
extremely rude service .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
we watched as the dog walked through the kitchen area .
we were very disappointed .
so not good .
for entrees , my husband ordered a pasta diablo with shrimp .
the hash was awful .
i will not go back .
no more .
this restaurant is ridiculous .
made reservations for new years eve , ( my birthday ) .
bad food , bad service .
we will not be back .
i am not kidding .
soup was okay but not terrific .
i get much better turkey from my grocery store .
all in all a pretty ordinary experience .
this place is miserable .
for some items , i 'm brand loyal .
Neutral
what really knocked it down a notch for me was the bathroom .
it 's just that it can be so much better .
ugh .
terrible , terrible food .
really poor quality .
so gross .
i also went on others suggestions of getting the fried rice .
spicy level was disappointing .
bad food .
if you like heat , go for the _num_ stars .
portions also were n't great for the price .
$ _num_ for two entrees .
so disclaimer : i just recently got into thai food .
the wait staff were friendly and fairly attentive .
_num_ things really freaked me out about this situation .
_num_ .
_num_ .
we left as quickly and politely as we could .
the owner truly does seem like you are bothering her by entering the restaurant .
the spice level was typical of americanized asian restaurants .
little meat or vegetables .
wo n't be back .
the interior looks like it was done in _num_ and not touched since .
i 've had better east african food in most african restaurants in chicago .
i 've walked away feeling pretty meh everytime i 've been there though .
it does n't matter much which one you pick .
so there , you earned yourself a second star .
very little lettuce and only a tomato on top .
not in a bowl .
avoid unless you are desperate .
random sour cream .
so now , i am looking for a new tailor .
the staff is also adequate -- at least they stay out of the way .
utterly disappointing .
i was n't impressed with wasabi .
very slow service .
worst seaweed ever seen .
bad nigiri and roll .
not worth it .
service was horrible .
wo n't be returning .
nasty .
no pool this weekend .
sleep was impossible .
fourth , nothing is complimentary .
very disappointing !
i 'm a gold member and have been diamond for several years .
too chaotic .
that is not the way to treat customers .
as for service , it was just o.k .
there are so many better places in madison .
in town for business trip as my home office is located in madison .
we walked the main street going toward campus .
once we reached the end , turned back and came across this bar .
went for lunch before the basketball game because it 's close to kohl center .
free popcorn , cheap food , decent service .
i think the service went well and the people were friendly .
blah , not so good .
cheese curds were less than stellar .
the brats were ok .
we drove from our hotel , found some parking and started our night .
she tells me that someone 's taken her phone and we begin to panic .
state street brats sucks .
brats taste little different than you 'd get from a gas station .
not impressed .
the food is gross .
the reason is to `` make sure you have money in your account '' .
no stars !
extremely rude staff .
it is not a restaurant .
it 's more like a cafeteria with a bar .
beer has a way of confusing people .
stopped by for a quick sandwich and beer before the badger game last night .
_num_ and _num_ stars .
i 'm not taking home silver , ok ?
it 's obviously not good .
there are better basic bars .
this is boring .
went here for lunch - ordered the burger and brat sandwich .
sooooo wrong .
bouncer told me to leave .
_num_ stars if i could .
manager is very rude .
really awful customer service .
ate here on a business trip after reading the reviews on yelp .
so sad .
big mistake .
pot stickers and pad thai noodles .
the pot stickers were just a big ball of dough with some filling .
no luck .
the dishes are made of animal oil which is super unhealthy .
skip this place .
_num_ stars in that case .
if you want your pork to just be pork , then see rating above .
i ultimately ordered the spring roll and the spicy chicken fried rice .
be very careful ordering here .
total was over $ _num_ .
it does n't say that on the menu .
it might have been good even , if it had been hot .
lazy .
never going back .
this place is nothing more than a haircut factory .
buying books online is not only cheaper , it 's also worth the wait .
go up state street and find t shirts , hats , etc on sale .
however , it 's a bit pricey .
bloody place .
this time , it was another staff there .
probably will not return .
service was truly sad .
)
this place is hit or miss .
( the estimated wait time was `` only '' _num_ hour . )
as for the food , my opinions are mixed .
ridiculous .
ridiculous !
not worth the hassle .
we ended up getting _num_ % charge since we asked for a split check .
it 's always too salty and overpowering in flavor .
that was extremely disappointing .
it as not topped with this sauce , it was absolutely smothered in it .
a dive bar , by nature , is what some would call shabby .
the dollar became a bit of an inside joke among my friends in madison .
rude , racist , dark .
homeless old men grabbing at my date .
wrong !
the actual show went great , just the management needs work .
this place is where comedy goes to die .
apparently if you know someone there they will bump legitimate business for you !
shame on you .
fool me twice ?
do not eat here .
i would n't eat here again .
the curry went into one hole and came right out the other .
yeah waitress lady , there is something else .
is that too much to ask ?
there was a small coffee bar , too .
the service was terribly slow .
we were pretty disappointed .
anyway , all these happened in a normal saturday night .
there is nothing unique at all about this store .
ugh .
terrible bar .
worst customer service ever !
so horrible .
the drinks are cheap and show it in the taste .
mostly everything is going to be made with rail liquor .
you really are not given the option otherwise .
the entire place smells like a bathroom .
turns out it 's not .
too much sweet n sour .
it is a huge hole with pool and darts .
_num_ star .
only bar downtown madison i can think of that has air hockey .
woo for air hockey & cheap beer , boo for everything else .
this is where dreams go to die .
smells like stale urine .
it 's that bad .
just not good espresso drinks .
the food , however , tasted synthetic .
we ordered wine , appetizers , salads , and entrees .
our appetizers came out and were okay ( sampler ) .
the salads and entrees followed before we could finish any of the previous courses .
nothing to write home about .
the entree , however , was aweful .
all-in-all , i give it a _num_ star rating for the atmosphere .
too bad too .
our sangria was literally 1/3 water .
whatever is the case , i ca n't imagine ever ordering food there again .
it seems very outdated .
we ate early ( 5:00 ) , so the service was very prompt .
our meal was brought out quickly after that .
it 's not incredibly vegetarian friendly for an italian restaurant .
just not a fan .
the food is where i have really struggled over the past two visits .
this seems crazy for an italian restaurant , to essentially have everything pre-made up .
as if pasta and sauce are hard to prepare .
i would recommend looking at many of the other italian restaurants in madison .
if it makes up for anything , though , the lemonade was amazing .
the cesar salad was iceberg lettuce , mozzarella and store bought croutons .
however , the point of this was for the food .
the pasta itself was very good , as long as it was sauce free .
false .
i went on a monday for lunch .
the service was awful .
just awful .

it was hot inside .
it was still cold in the middle when it was served .
food is terrible .
service was really slow .
why oh why .
extremely disappointing .
they also will not go back .
the fish was overcooked .
my boyfriend ordered a steak with stuffed shrimp .
dessert was mediocre .
you 've been warned .
olive garden may be a better pick .
needless to say , he was done eating at that point .
horrible .
horrible service , rude waitresses .
for appetizer , i had the escargot .
a bit disappointed .
it was weird .
brandy old fashioned was a work if art .
asked the hostess for a table for _num_ .
very lousy food .
each bite was a bit harder then the last .
was false .
so i ca n't comment on the food .
soup was bland .
what did disappoint was the service .
but no server .
very dim lighting , tiny dining area .
coke was stale .
not worth the cost .
_num_ of us ordered this and all agreed that it was way to tough .
even the caesar was off .
i had the walleye fish and the sauce on top of it was salty .
so here 's me following through with my promise .
he told us we could wait a bit longer and eat in the basement .
hmmm not very friendly .
i guess they fooled me and got me to do what they wanted .
avoid at all costs .
went for dinner passing thru town in january .
lots of food but the quality is not wonderful .
ugh .
he did n't seem to mind .
i 've often had to wait quite awhile for waitstaff .
not worth it .
simply poor service .
ordered a beer and a buddy ordered some chips .
bad form , guys .
i also want to know why their rice and beans tastes like water .
learn my lesson .
deep fried tilapia in flour tortillas .
the food is not good .
food was not good at all .
it was unfortunate .
our server was n't very friendly .
the waitress never refilled our chips .
i needed something to wash down the dry enchilada .
i am not sure if she charged me or not .
but i think they could try just a little harder .
dealing with the main office though , is another story .
i actually regret recommending them to my friends who were looking for an apartment .
they are inconsistent .
gross food .
in fact , even the salad is not quite worth the price !
too much grease ?
bad food and slow service .
only food here though .
just plain weird .
seriously , take that shit off your menu .
was it some kind of attempt at a new twist on pizza ?
and why do all the vegetables have the same taste and texture as tofu ?
not worth the wait .
skip it !
i saw it listed nowhere on the menu !
i know , it 's a small kitchen , so there 's that .
burgers way over cooked and overpriced .
menu is limited .
super slow !
worst bar .
we ate and left as soon as we could .
ordered the spaghetti bolognese , $ _num_ .
very overpriced and completely blah .
the hours posted on the door matched what 's here .
strongly suggest anyone call before they try to park downtown on a saturday .
do you have to badger badger cab to arrive ?
person answers the phone .
bc : how many people ?
me : just me .
badger cab is a mixed bag .
not worth the savings .
cab drivers do n't listen and take you whatever way they feel like going .
tonight , i called them twice .
shady , shady business .
ordered for _num_ pm at 1pm .
_num_ degrees .
fail .
guess what green cab is going to get a whole new fleet of customers .
union cab is the much better option in madison because they respect their customers .
worst cab service ever !
unbelievable bad customer service !
do n't ever trust badger cab again !
you can take a cab in downtown chicago for a lot less money !
go with union cab .
walked in here on a pub crawl around madison .
not impressed .
but ca n't complain about the drink prices .
the potatoes are only ok .
i went in with a party of five , around 10am .
if all tables are full , wait outside .
Negative
i 've had far , far better at much more reasonable prices .
the portion of it is too small and pricy .
service was just adequate with a very nice but strange waitress .
i visited the restaurant during my trip to madison .
how gross is that ?
this place needs some serious cleaning !
it was fine , but were pretty sure we ordered beef and got chicken .
perhaps it was the yogurt sauce it was drenched in .
i will not be back .
no no no !
this was ridiculous .
the vegetarian dishes that we had were a little short on salt .
the waiters were friendly though .
seems too limited to me .
we spent all of our time in the _num_ and under area .
i requested a dinosaur themed party for an extra $ _num_ .
complete waste of money .
basically nothing dinosaur themed there .
staff in general seem to be part time college students .
i ordered favor bags at $ _num_ a pop .
basically , this place is a giant playground .
very disappointed .
and they sent a very small amount of fries , too .
i dont think i will ever order delivery from them .
i would not go back .
this was the worst !
oh and soggy fries .
no lettuce , no nothing .
i was somewhat impressed when i first walked in .
the guys here ... they 're not hipsters .
avoid .
which is okay but could be done better .
the dining : they have _num_ bars and _num_ restaurant .
green beans and corn - that were once fresh , maybe a year ago .
they do n't deserve one star .
worst management company ever !
total jerks when you call .
my only hope for them , karma !
disgusting .
if you do n't , find a different rental company .
disgusting .
if you do n't , find a different rental company .
bad bad customer service .
do n't feel welcome here .
but i do n't like it .
this is not ny pizza .
its different , and if you have been drinking , it tastes better .
however , photos can be deceptive , it 's the taste that matters .
i 'm going to give this place another chance because the pizza was tasty .
as it stands currently , i would recommend glass nickel .
to get to review : shitty greasy cheese and ingredients , so so crust .
if the brand seems like something popular or trendy , the price goes up .
as far as i know , banana republic is n't retro .
overall , it 's hard to find a good deal at st. vinny 's .

however , rent was cheap .

worst experience ever .
they were quite filthy .
total rip off !
worst property management ever .
so i gave up trying .
i ate about half of it and left hungry .
no further apology .
no further car washes .
really pretty terrible .
car wash .
this is not acceptable .
everyone looks unhappy .
screw this , there has got to be a better place .
they seem to be chosen for their ability to keep the owner company .
the books are often ridiculously overpriced .
she was more than willing to sell us a much more expensive gold band .
apparently , this is not true .
the second time i was in trying to pick out a watch .
the room had a musty odor .
the bed was lumpy .
little do you know that light music is being heard next door !
it was terrible .
for $ _num_ a night i think these should be addressed .
stayed in _num_ .
avoid !
they squeezed me in , and rotated the tires too .
they are putting a new cover on , for free of course .
$ _num_ a night .
the elevator make me press the button with the force of _num_ tons .
she was generally friendly , though .
no pool .
small building , that makes sense .
sorry , no deal .
very frustrating .
the staff was friendly enough and the bed was comfy .
the bathroom was gross .
the appetizers consisted of quiche ( blech ) and raw vegetables .
gross !
, complete with shorts ( in february ) and backwards baseball caps .
the complementary breakfast , snacks , and desserts are hit or miss .
Positive
she never does .
i hear nothing from her again .
she calls me back , leaves a voicemail .
this is completely unacceptable !
i stayed here for a conference in september and stayed in a concourse room .
the decor was incredibly dated , i 'm guessing _num_ 's ?
ancient decor , funky smells .
the shower was adequate but had low pressure .
booked a room a few weeks in advance of our trip through expedia .
bathroom not clean enough .
no in room safe .
no newspaper as promised .
my issue with the hotel was the cleanliness of my room .
the room was clean and well kept , the beds were comfortable .
lots of selection in the gym , but very few channels in the room .
why bother .
really why bother ?
almost too rich , but the texture of the ( pork ? )
big mistake .
ick .
f my life .
but i am never setting foot inside that restaurant again .
_num_ stars for the idea .
avoid at all costs .
there was a line at the door only one cashier .
talk about a disaster .
i had to go downstairs to get our drinks .
i was wrong .
my husband ordered an italian sausage sub .
no cheese .
it 's hard to find good italian food in madison .
so disappointing .
it would take a total overhaul to get me back into this restaurant .
really disappointing food .
will not go back .
it was literally dripping off the noodles .
my mother-in-law got the chicken parm .
i 'm guessing it was frozen at some point , like the chicken parm .
obviously i refused .
stay away from jiffy lube !
not your fault .
it was maybe another _num_ .
no no no no no .
awkward .
fries were boring .
coleslaw was too vinegary .
sourdough roll was too frozen .
tartar sauce was all mayonnaise .
because half of madison is there every friday night .
it 's decent but too costly for the quality .
the place always seems crowded .
this layout has been mentioned in other reviews as well .
i 've been here a few times .
almost , if there is such a thing , too strong .
hot , gooey , greasy .
- cheese soup + chunky tomato soup = delicious bowl of soup .
- our second order of cheese curds .
and were rather cold .
lousy steak .
greasy potatoes .
my friday night at avenue bar was one to remember .
other servers were not .
the verdict : not so great .
been to a bar/restaurant before ?
old wisconsin supper club .
for $ _num_ a plate i 'd expect more quality and/or quantity .
i was very dissapointed with the avenue bar .
tomato soup was great , calamari was thinly breaded and with a great sauce .
it was very difficult to get a drink while we waited .
you know , normally , i would rate this place higher .
it was just today , it seemed off .
the prices went up portions down .
it was boiled cod .
it was awful !
dry and bland .
really a disappointment .
_num_ thing i did like was additional booths and less crowded table seating .
avoid if you can !
what a disappointment .
she could have cared less .
we get seated closer to _num_ pm .
more waiting , appetizers arrive .
more waiting and _num_ rounds of bread baskets later .
)
my steak was over cooked and dry .
the hashbrowns were also cold .
skip it .
the meat was tough and not very flavorful .
the steakhouse salad was the best thing i ate all night .
i ordered the petite filet with a blue cheese crust with the garlic mash .
really , for lunch ?
wrong !
the scallops were cold and under cooked .
my steak was charred a bit much , inside done properly .
selected this place to celebrate 40th birthday with a group of friends .
the service was horrible .
was informed that they only come in black and stout ( almost black ) .
i want a more intimate setting with beer and reasonable ticket prices .
i 'd take a dumpy old theater over this place any day .
has the ambience of a cheap bar .
not really my thing .
as she walked away .
they have raised their prices , but not the quality .
first off , the host was welcoming and fast , and the waitress rocked .
she even took care of the bill quickly and kept waters refilled .
convenient for the line cooks , not so much for your belly .
you 're cheap , but not cheap enough for this greasy fare .
worst .
some are very nice but inept .
some are terribly rude .
i visit here nearly weekly with a group .
the first time i visited here i ordered the walleye with toast .
i ordered them with the walleye ( again ) , along with the potatoes .
once or twice a year i tell myself to try this place again .
example : two weeks ago ... i arrived at 5pm to play volleyball .
the focaccia has even been replaced with rye bread .
and i miss it .
annoying .
the bread was served with some `` duck fat '' dipping sauce .
probably never going there again .
pick off most of the veggies to make them passable .
espresso royale sucks .
not all that fresh .
fail .
both were bad .
this coffee is absolute shit .
once upon a time , this was one of my favorite coffee shops .
you walk in and the baristas stare at you like you 're an inconvenience .
i 've never been very impressed .
i was really dissapointed by espresso royale .
it was really light too .
it tasted like nothing .
they 've slowly declined over the years and have finally hit bottom .
it 's like they simply stopped caring .
usually a short `` what would you like ? ''
rip-off !
walls and furniture were in rough shape .
very awkward .
pathetic .
in september i received _num_ worth of merchandise i never ordered .
not true .
the meal was a filet and chicken breast with roasted potatoes .
oh wait , i know !
i could 've made a better product at home for under half the price .
are you kidding me ?
_num_ stars because the place at least looked ok .
better sushi in other places in madison .
poor food and poor service !
their service never disappoints .
the sashimi tastes like its b quality from the supermarket .
horrible service .
not okay .
everything runs through your mind , what else did they eat ?
i love sushi and tar tar , so raw is not a problem .
horrible delivery service .
all in all , do n't order delivery .
if you are going to do the hibachi get steak or chicken .
the wait staff was was nice enough , but entirely overwhelmed .
i ordered a teriyaki chicken , one of my favorite signature japanese dish .
maybe it 's just time to look for a new sushi place.
worst service ever .
will not come back .
just ridiculous .
the service was terrible !
the service at times is surly and confusing .
otherwise there is n't anything very exciting about pizza di roma .
terrible , awful sandwiches .
seriously gross .
the pizza looks tasty ( but looks can be deceiving ) .
sick .
i 'd like to begin by saying that the food was pretty good .
just finished having my pizza and caesar salad which i had delivered .
i ordered the supreme which had veggies , sausage , and pepperoni .
would not recommend .
gross .
very disappointing .
went here and got two specialty slices : chicken parm and caprese .
what a lame place .
check it out for yourself , though .
no such luck .
we walked left .
gross .
sunday brunch , _num_ people , 11am .
* our waiter neglected to fill our water and coffee throughout our visit .
disgusting .
horrible service .
would not go back .
food just was n't good .
there are a lot of tastier and friendlier options for mexican food in madison .
however i have n't found many friendly tellers there .
gross .
seriously disappointing .
shame !
shame !
shame ! ''
tasting room has them for about _num_ .
terrible customer service .
the staff seemed cordial though a bit distracted and not particularly helpful .
hopefully sales staff will be better informed .
so i can only assume katie thinks i 'm lying .
how frustrating .
party of _num_ , me and my husband .
one clam chowder soup , appetizers and crab legs .
otherwise , choose another seafood place .
so , i had heard great things about ocean grill .
not a good sign .
talk about snooty .
very , very poor .
Negative
i tried this place after it was suggested by a local .
this is also why i went back several times .
not only have i experienced better , i 've made better .
the restaurant is usually quite cramped , and this leads to discomfort .
was an overall drag of an experience .
we were disappointed .
our meal was disgusting !
the first stop he made was to the window to pick up an order .
i was disgusted .
this food is not italian .
the pasta was fine .
the calamari was tasteless .
too bad .
but the food was only subpar .
bartender ignored us .
so he left to get our drinks .
i am sound sensitive and it was getting me on edge .
last night my boyfriend and i went and it was very busy .
had dinner there tonight .
terrible .
the bread was hard and cold .
i would not recommend this resturant .
ok so _num_ % sure they forgot to put in my tables order .
my other major complaint is that the wireless rarely works .
however , rude service .
rude .
rude .
rude .
the latte was better than expected .
you will also constantly hear cars , buses , trucks .
venue needs to be cleaner .
only sheets are replaced per person per stay .
a severe rip off !
chin 's fails in all three areas .
i ordered the pad thai with chicken .
the noodles were just drenched in soy sauce or something like it .
if you 're going to get something get the stir fries .
i 'm not saying this because `` it 's not authentic asian ! ''
Neutral
i felt as though i had _num_ seconds to look at the menu .
ambiance : well it has the typical too trendy look to it .
short hair , attitude , matching t-shirts , probably pit hair .
hate that .
just gross .
not kid friendly food .
potatoes are not good .
this is my first time in madison and my first restaurant we visited .
i felt more like an inconvenience then a customer .
i would recommend mcdonald 's before marigold kitchen .
i will not be returning .
tea water lukewarm .
noisy .
marigold 's potatoes and pancakes are out of this world .
cashier was rude and unhelpful .
complete chaos as soon as you walk in the door .
no thanks not again .
very disappointing place .
previous visits have been worth more like _num_ stars , but not today .
if you are seeking quantity and not quality marigold should be consideration .
i ordered a side of marigold potatoes because the quiche only came with greens .
the handsome man i was with ordered the duck confit hash .
only the potatoes were tasty .
toast was an extra $ _num_ .
would not recommend !
was excited to try this place .
disgusting .
we also got a short stack of blueberry pancakes .
not so much .
which , attitude aside , just makes everything take longer .
more importantly , they are n't particularly good with their espresso drinks .
really , 4-5 stars ?
glass nickel , though ?
the crust is me , too chewy and without taste .
there , i feel better , i needed to get that off my chest .
zero organization .
he treated me as if i owed them money !
if you want to shop for korean food , go to park st .
Negative
it 's the only place in town that carries them .
however , the prices are outrageous .
my suit was not cleaned completely .
i could walk there faster than that .
makes me wonder if its new staff on training ?
lousy service .
it does n't end there .
i can not imagine why i would ever put myself through this again .
jimmy john 's representative contacted me earlier today !
it does n't end there .
i can not imagine why i would ever put myself through this again .
this was in _num_ .
i 've not gone back since .
no apology .
it seems like you have to order everything separately here .
it should be more like $ $ for price .
this was our first and only visit .
some of our food was cold .
i do not recommend this place .
really disappointing .
tables that were seated long after us were served first .
very disappointing !
believe it or not , some people really like it !
_num_ minute wait on a saturday morning ?
pathetic .
it looks just like a long branch with a tiny crown on top .
i will not be going back .
they had plenty of blue but nothing worked for me .
sketchy .
very unprofessional !
horrible !
horrible !
horrible !
_num_ stars .
_num_ of _num_ stars .
ill be back then !
the whole place could use an update .
bad cheese curds mediocre burgers .
bad cheese curds mediocre burgers .
a little disappointed here !
and like another reviewer ; where is the `` local '' provider ?
on january 5th i dropped off _num_ vintage watches to have the bands changed .
i 'm a small business owner and really support other small businesses .
Negative
and table salt and table pepper ?
so my fault there .
the tenderloin was about an inch thick and maybe five ounces .
the edge and part of the bottom was charred ( way beyond crispy ! )
i ordered the lobster tail with baked potato with a dinner salad .
gross !
it is impossible to imagine how this place is still in business .
the waiter was horrible !
when i ordered there was a choice between broiled and fried walleye .
anyway , the steak needed salt !
i 've never seasoned a steak at those prices before ... never !
the walleye , fried , was pretty awesome though .
if you go , check those things out .
it sad , too .
this was our first and probably last visit to smoky 's .
drinks were good but very pricy .
relish , soup and tomato juice with lemon were the highlights tonight .
my husband 's prime rib was mostly fat .
gross .
service was slow .
no thanks .
waiter response , same perch as we always serve .
my walleye was tasteless .
caution ... read all the paperwork they give you .
never had any problems before .
i picked up my truck and quickly drove off to another appointment .
but they got greedy .
the staff totally sucks .
like , omg , do n't live here .
its not worth it .
ick .
except maybe for the chocolate chip cookies .
i 'm not a big fan .
_num_ .
nothing has changed .
it was flat out terrible .
their bathroom is disgusting !
disappointing .
i will not be back .
i said no .
what is this mess ?
cheap , tasty , and vegetarian options .
will not be returning .
then i 'm running late somewhere and stop .
a few mornings ago i walk in .
she says she does , but she needs a dozen bagels as well .
d o n o t g o h e r e !
we asked _num_ different people for the wine , including the waitress .
it was appalling .
anyway -- totally weird service .
i wore my jacket at the dinner table for the night .
our group of _num_ arrived on time for our reservation .
unbelievable .
no customer service skills .
too bad .
i did not receive a call back .
like lasagna with your salt , or pizza with your salt ?
really disappointing .
do n't reserve your table online .
horrible food !
no apology .
other than the issues mentioned , the experience was pretty pleasant .
we ordered : the potstickers ( steamed ) they were fine .
hubby , curry duck .
-- do n't chase me down to my car , your manager ( ? )
i know you can do better .
more importantly , the sanitary standards must be raised here !
they were apologetic and offered to redo the order .
i eat take out from this place every week because someone else treats me .
the waiting 's not over .
like others have mentioned their curries are almost embarrassing .
i simply feel like there are far better thai food restaurants in madison .
_num_ mins ?
i 've eaten here before and the food is average .
overpriced and really not great .
just awful .
service slow too .
no thank you .
the takeout estimates were also way off .
horrible service .
the lighting is odd and at times makes it difficult to read the menu .
there are plenty of other thai options in and around madison .
i thought the chicken coconut soup should be more savory .
really really cold bibimbap .
do not eat here .
chinese food tastes way better than the korean food in madison .
go chicago for better korean food and higher serving quality .
the portions are large and it comes served with a side of miso soup .
why only _num_ stars ?
the wound closed up but never healed .
it already is about _num_ % better !
only when i left did a salesperson shout after me .
i genuinely hate this store .
it was me and two groups of _num_ people .
it was that bad !
it was ridiculous !
over all horrible !
really slow service ... .
Negative
this place has typical greasy , heavy , diner food .
useless .
it 's beyond bad .
avoid at all costs !
i purchased a groupon for a shellac manicure .
that said -- it was cheap .
what i got : plain bone wings .
i 've had better pizza at chuck e cheese 's .
the lady explained to me that the insurance system is `` confusing . ''
i stopped in during non peak hours on a thursday ( 2:30 ) .
my food was n't good .
i ate it because i was hungry and went without lunch for the day .
visiting the madison , wi area and stopped in before 11am to have lunch .
at the birthday dinner , i ordered the ribeye steak .
food was very mediocre .
overall , not a good experience .
this seemed odd since they make sandwiches - they ca n't dress your bagel ?
i double checked to make sure they had given me plain cream cheese .
yup plain cream cheese .
filthy and rude .
tables not wiped down .
my husband and i often grab lunch here when running around on a saturday .
not exactly the family friendly environment i think of when i think of panera .
not something i really want to think about .
she was very very demanding in what what going to happen during the class .
not ideal .
i did try out other instructors to get a return on my investment .
the other instructors were great .
very disappointing .
the small pieces of salmon were okay , though nothing exceptional .
random second hand tables , though most had their own set of matching chairs .
we have n't eaten here in awhile .
the smoked salmon benedict is drenched in hollandaise .
too much .
and the ingredients are really , really cheap .
they were too busy talking and deciding which cd to play .
the only flavor mine had was from the $ _num_ worth of peppers .
the picture of tiramisu on the menu was square and looked homemade .
there goes another star .
in past visits , we 've had the thin crust .
i think rosati 's does this much better .
sure enough , after calling , i found out i was right .
nothing on the vegetarian pizza .
presentation was awful !
extremely rude !
worst pizza ever .
the salad did not taste good .
if you are looking for cheap and filling , this is your place .
so , amongst other things , i ordered two chicken sandwiches and cheese curds .
first time ordering through rosati 's .
terribly disappointed .
pizza was cold .
sauce was tasteless .
bland .
we ordered baked lasagna dinner and ribs with fries dinner tonight .
third , the personal pan pizza ( cheese with pineapple ) .
as stated in other reviews , extremely greasy and messy .
food was bland an uninspired .
the kitchen and management could do a lot better .
crap service !
not to mention my son only got half of what he ordered ... .
worst service ever .
we will not be back .
we were n't disappointed .
espresso tastes average , like a starbucks .
but , desperately in need of deep cleaning and updating .
maybe he was was out of everything except the reasonably ok medium roast .
victor 's charges $ _num_ .
that just seems insane .
i had hip problems , and was referred here by dr. adams .
total garbage .
total joke of a doctor .
you can only order huge cones at a very premium price .
the quality control is not there .
it drives my totally crazy .
oh how i miss what you once were michael 's frozen custard .
if my raspberry shake was in any way natural , i 'd be surprised .
shakes for under _num_ bucks ... like you 're in the _num_ 's .
i devoured mine , while my friend slowly delighted hers .
they are n't there .
this place is extremely expensive .
but if there are other options , then try finding something cheaper !
having read the other reviews here , i was expecting a lot better .
we were disappointed .
my dining companion rated his black bean burger as average .
still underwhelmed with the food and can not justify adding any stars .
i split the risotto and a combo plate of spinach and chicken enchiladas .
update : the chocolate cake was bomb .
i ordered the seared tuna , he ordered the burger .
changing servers in the middle of a meal service .
lettuce a little brown , rolls very out of bag from store feeling .
my salad was plain .
would not give 2nd try .
only the soups arrived .
it was n't dry .
it was beyond gross .
we did n't finish the cake .
it just was n't good .
have eaten here several times before .
an unfortunate choice .
personally , it 's not for me .
i was incredibly disappointed .
the food was horrible .
i ordered french toast with berries on sourdough bread .
will not go there again .
my other half ordered the hot buttered rum for her alcoholic beverage of choice .
_num_ stars on the app .
the waitress brought out another plate as well , so we could share .
we finished the rib , minus the 1/3 of it that was fat .
i got these chicken enchiladas that were said to come with beans .
they were so dry .
dry and flavorless .
so disappointing .
again , flavorless .
just pass on this place .
ive only gone in for lunch but everything ive had has been stellar .
the menu described a pepper stuffed with rice , mushrooms and spinach .
tonight i had a _num_ $ juicy burger which was anything but .
not worth the wait .
most recently , i had an eggs benedict .
oh , i do like the decor of the place .
not a big deal , just curious .
as far as the food goes ... i will say hit and miss .
same went for the entrees and deserts .
been there a few times and have never walked away thinking it was great .
but awful .
i was excited to go because i 've heard it 's a madison staple .
ended the meal with flourless cake which again , was incredibly small .
do n't let the interesting menu fool you .
service was terrible .
nothing spectacular .
Neutral
however , i left there hungry .
do n't rent from these people .
sure it cost more - but that was our only option .
she 's not a plumber .
brought in two new pairs of jeans to be hemmed .
i am ignored .
and in the end i leave without a purchase .
i was in search of a particular color .
it was probably old info on the website that referred me .
lousy customer service .
sales staff seemed put out by my questions .
no apology .
recently , i tried booking online but also called to confirm the reservation .
unlike most b & bs , the owners do n't live there .
breakfast is n't served until 8:30 a.m. !
that 's ridiculous .
it was too small .
not much higher but enough for another drink during happy hour .
this place just sucks .
oh it must be the margaritas , cause alcohol makes every taste perfect .
to be fair , i only order burritos .
i was so disappointed .
)
if they charged half the price for their food , i could accept that .
in fact , get rid of the plastic cups for the salsa too .
also a bit pricey - chips and salsa are n't included with meals .
not my cup of tea .
not big on flavor .
i would n't recommend it !
nothing special .
bland food .
bad service .
chocolate milk was loudly offered as an option to my son .
the food was mediocre .
not that great .
we wiped as much as we could off .
i could n't taste the jerk .
gone is the deli from which you could purchase yummy guacamole and other specialties .
the rice was over seasoned and dry .
in particular staff does n't listen well or do what they say .
)
they put the toppings ( onion in our case ) under the cheese .
so i had to try this pizza .
it was ok - not impressed .
the service was pretty good .
greasy , so greasy .
absolutely would not recommend .
let 's fast forward to monday ( march _num_ ) .
i suspect because too much product was applied .
we scheduled the appointment for later that week on thursday ( march _num_ ) .
no big deal .
she offered $ _num_ .
this happened _num_ more times !
_num_ days later it fell out .
not even real stones .
too cookie cutter .
i would not give them my money again .
it 's a shame .
they have really nice audio equipment for sale and the owner is very knowledgable .
you probably could find what you 're looking for if he wanted to help .
ok , get to digging .
we wish them luck .
Negative
spend your money elsewhere .
it 's rather unfortunate .
maybe the food is just , eh !
it was served with feta cheese , red onions and cucumbers on the side .
there was no kebab .
more of ... eh .
i do n't mind expensive meals as long as they 're worth it .
the service was bad .
spend your money somewhere else .
honestly , the last time i went in this store was in _num_ .
however , their prices are through the roof .
too much of a hustle .
really bad service .
i was very disappointed .
gel polish is not for everyone .
it looks like it is , a hotel restaurant .
the restaurant smells like an assisted living facility .
service is slow .
the menu seems overpriced , especially given the other dining choices nearby .
all three meals where all right but not amazing .
the quality to price ratio was off ( too expensive ) .
service was horrible .
$ 1,000 for a cake and you leave it ready to fall .
horrible vendor !
thank goodness i 'm not in the market for a wedding cake !
i 'm not entirely sure i would get another one from here again .
i left feeling heavy with greasy food .
i also tried one of the almond butter cookies .
will not be returning !
waste of money .
household items and furniture are usually in good shape and tend to move quickly .
there is a ton more , but i think you get the point .
Negative
should be negative stars .
have never seen this in an apt complex , especially so far from downtown .
it is very long in the tooth .
empty .
there is never anyone at the seafood area to help you .
the only bell is in the meat section .
there is never anyone in the meat department .
no one is there .
if you want groceries , sure , they have groceries !
avoid if you can .
probably not .
we asked for waters three times , and never got anything .
we are not going back .
and portion size considerably reduced .
lousy service as well .
i love a place with free peanuts in the shell .
someone please message me when they do .
was really disappointed .
ugh .
also , the burgers are kind of expensive for this hole-in-the-wall place .
the place was pretty busy on sunday .
just kind of uncomfortable .
then there are some benches that are about _num_ by _num_ or even less .
then the bar runs along the back .
the bar server never even smiled .
i mean wow ... is that really the way you run a business ?
dive or not .
it was unbelievable .
do not go here for coloring .
it 's just sad .
b ) our waitress was non-existent !
many places do hash browns better .
again , they really needed salt & pepper .
the quality does n't meet up to the price .
no apology .
my husband ordered the roasted garlic sirloin .
the chips were hot which was a big plus .
so dry !
meh meh meh meh meh .
i was disappointed here .
did someone or something die in the corner ?
really , what else would you get at a wisconsin supper club .
should be worst cleaners !
first - and last - attempt to patronize this business .
it 's hit or miss .
_num_ ) they were `` out '' of thin crust .
umm , yeah weird but ok .
it was not good pizza .
really bad experience .
worst cheesy breadsticks !
will never return to this location .
poor quality .
lasagna was bad .
not worth the money .
this was my first and only visit .
beware - ski equipment is not on sale year round !
they seem to be higher than anyone else .
gag me .
$ _num_ for an old fashioned ?
why someone would do this is beyond me .
meh ... i thought it was just okay .
disappointing .
the wraps for the moo shu made me feel like i was eating paper .
ordered here for the first time , after hearing great reviews .
lasted just shy of two weeks .
i 've been here before and did have a ok experience .
he just figured i did a bang up job on them , myself .
just awful nails .
terrible experience !
there was n't .
my shellac only lasted about a week .
to bad .
as a comparison , i bought my bridal gown at a different shop .
yeah , maybe you do n't always get what you want .
but you should get what you pay for .
there was bird poop on and near the court .
id rather play outside in the sub freezing wisconsin weather than play here again .
i really disliked my visit to this dollar tree .
there is the option to add beef , buffalo chicken or chicken mix .
chicken mix comes with green pepper and onion .
this is a really tough review for me to write .
however , the food and prices could be improved .
what stands out are the cheese curds .
the oil pools in the bottom making the lower layer even more oily .
it was a tropical , pineapple cake .
my pasta dish was not good .
food was mediocre .
they gave him fish again , and it was extremely hot .
it was very disappointing !
snow and ice storm the person backed out on me .
worst .
big mistake .
furthermore there are trees on their lot that are really suffering .
ugh .
how hard is it to regularly stock the paper ?
nothing changed as far as where the seating area is .
_num_ stars for food but not a-ok overall because of the service .
i 'm really disappointed .
how is that for customer service ?
no , sorry .
this location is terrible .
last friday i came in around 6pm and ordered a fruit spinach salad .
however , this location has messed up the last time .
probably around 8pm .
i should have asked for my money back .
this one however needs some serious changes .
there is a lot of fabric but nothing particularly interesting not of high quality .
very disappointed .
terrible customer service .
counter staff clearly has not been trained well .
poor selection of frames .
i felt like i was bothering the employees here with my order .
my first plate arrived , onions obviously present in the tacos .
second plate : tortilla , steak , nothing else in the tacos .
horrible horrible food .
even the rice is n't authentic .
ugh .
bad call .
but , at the same time , raising their prices .
it was gross .
on our trip there last wednesday night my son ordered the rio bravo .
kind if boring .
it just was n't that good .
mediocre food .
not feeling it .
i ordered the half chimichanga off the lunch menu for $ _num_ .
did they squeeze it out of a tube ?
so disappointing .
my entree was the poblano mole enchiladas .
the prices were absurd !
no purchase from me !
depending on the name brand , each shirt or dress was priced differently .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
gross !
alas , it does not .
very annoying .
i literally just walked out the door .
terrible customer service .
there wasnt much sausage at all for what you paid for .
very disappointing .
pathetic .
wo n't be back .
such a disappointment .
i 've been consistent with ordering jambalaya because its the quintessential new orleans dish .
they charge whatever they feel like .
holy hole in a doughnut , batman !
asked for owner to request a more reasonable price .
_num_ dollars !
i realize this is carryout chinese and my rating reflects this understanding .
my guess would be the egg rolls .
it 's cheap for a reason .
terrible !
i could n't believe it !
one cut , maybe , but more than that ?
she could have at least said something so he could watch for infection .
so anyway , up until now i was the only customer in the place .
i did so because martin has him as a repair facility .
so he spent another half hour fixing that problem .
totally false !
you can wait weeks until you get a response to your emails .
caution : this store is really small .
i stopped going there , though convenient .
we have taken _num_ cars there the last year _num_ times .
the environment is really noisy .
worst mcdonalds ever .
i explained this to them and they sent a tech to our house .
am i glad i had them come out !
not my fault !
ridiculous .
a linen closet door is not square .
our garage door fell apart .
nothing special .
typical of this type of family restaurant .
many pages of menu items , from liver and onions to eggs & bacon .
not so sure now .
the coffee is so-so and most everything is too greasy for my taste .
if you like oil and grease , you 'll like it here .
what horrible service .
this place is horrible .
if you really want my business own your mistakes .
but they fall down on the food and cleanliness .
sometimes two napkins full of grease .
omg this place sucks .
it was horrible .
it was pure crap .
i ordered room service _num_ days for breakfast .
second day , not as good .
walls were very thin .
not good !
some front desk people were fabulous and some not so much .
some staff were helpful .
the room was clean and the hall decor seemed updated and fine with me .
this sheraton is run much different that an average sheraton .
_num_ .
this is just unacceptable .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
one light bulb at the dining room in _num_ is out .
_num_ .
the second room had a stain on the carpet going into the bathroom .
again not very clean .
my girlfriend and i recently stayed at this sheraton .
for your own comfort , we ask that the windows be kept closed .
sucks .
stayed here _num_ nights .
just not good .
not impressed .
avoid at all costs .
hotel hallways were a little dark with all the dark wood around .
this was room _num_ .
this was room _num_ .
not the most family friendly hotel .
had to go find a local walgreens to buy milk and snacks at .
_num_ .
the room was nice and bed was comfortable .
the walls were thin and i could hear the tv from my neighbor .
bad idea .
service slow .
how wrong i was !
learn from my mistake !
slow , rude , disrespectful staff .
the fries my boyfriend ordered were the highlight of the meal .
that is n't saying much .
i would not eat here again .
ate dinner before meeting a bunch of friends .
bar staff was sort of hit and miss as well .
i just get less impressed each time i go back .
i did not eat any food .
alright so i 've only ever been here when i 've been hungover .
i went here recently , and i had a spinach and cheese omelet .
fail .
it may be that it comes down to the chef .
ill still patronize your bakery but as for meals i think i am done .
so whatever it was was showing up in her attentiveness to her customers .
it 's very much ... it 's hard to describe .
there are usually _num_ servers working the entire diner .
also , kudos to them for being professional .
service was really bad !
does n't even deserve _num_ star !
okay , no problem .
my husbands breakfast of eggs and steak were good too , according to him .
i signed my slip and asked for change to leave a tip .
this location is horrible !
the nachos bell grande only had cheese and sour cream .
it does n't end there .
there is a reason people do n't frequent the south side for food .
wrong !
not impressed .
slept without any blankets as had to work in the morning .
install took twice as long as they promised and had many issues .
the $ _num_ lunch special is a burger and fries .
no service at all .
stopped saturday late afternoon for one $ _num_ beer .
later that afternoon , i get a call from someone else at badger bowl .
beware .
i go out to relax and get served .
call badger bowl and ask them why do they hate kids .
within a _num_ day period , two more advertisement ( spam ) emails followed .
we struggled to find anything we liked that was in stock .
sleazy .
then i get a call they will show up at _num_ am .
crap store .
american tv ... .
i will not miss you !
i 'm _num_ years old .
they did n't seem to care .
the problem was n't the cook though .
if youre an attractive woman , dont go there .
they are rude as hell !
place states that they are open from _num_ am to 2:30 am .
there are flies all over the place .
nasty .
hell no .
mcdonalds would get the award !
this review is long overdue .
my home is under _num_ sq .
really zero stars !
went back to get it and they still messed it up .
a _num_ min drive home .
text book failure .
nobody seems to care at all about what they are doing .
i took it to one of the dealers and had the bike looked at .
the list of what they provide was a mile long and the bill ?
$ _num_ to $ _num_ !
dr. hook does not deserve you .
admittedly it was late friday and saturday .
they were rushing , must have had a bigger job to get to next .
they charge too much , care is so-so .
i would go to veterinary emergency service .
terrible experience .
the guys that showed up worked hard , but clearly management needs improvement .
so , i hired them again for my next move .
my fiance and i called them several times to check their arrival status .
horrible .
Negative
hire a better company .
horribly unprofessional .
very rude .
nobody has any idea of the concept of customer service .
worst moving experience .
would never hire again .
your complaint was assigned id _num_ .
silly me for thinking there was time .
but never at other pizza pits .
depressing , depressing , depressing .
also , sad .
ugh .
ugh .
ugh .
ugh .
ugh .
gross .
employees really could n't care less .
the store is nothing fancy by any means .
this place is terrible .
breakfast in the morning was standard for that type of thing .
my second room was much nicer and cleaner .
i 'm beyond disgusted .
the hot tub had black water in it .
no kidding .
free breakfast is low end and the facilities are all substandard .
nothing around .
after they have your money it is impossible to get customer service .
after they have your money it is impossible to get customer service .
horrible experience !
terrible service !
horrible experience !
terrible service !
terrible shopping experience !
so we wait to hand her the money .
we will not be back .
this is a manager that appears to be related to ownership .
i do n't get it .
really , i do n't .
it 's not spicy .
it 's kind of cheesy .
no thanks .
ugh .
are you fucking kidding me ?
overpriced rip off .
cold .
no cheese .
frankly , i think this was completely overpriced .
for $ _num_ , it 's totally overpriced .
i 've been to this location twice now for relatively simple maintenance .
however , i also needed brake work .
how are you not careful with brakes , knowing that there are children passengers .
avoid this place .
it 's not worth it .
it was unbelievable !
neither friendly .
really wish they had better inventory .
total ripoff !
very bad experience .
$ _num_ for a medium ?
worst service ever !
very dense .
we had a coupon so last week , i ordered two gluten free pizzas .
i 've been ordering two or three times a week for about a year .
it was supper time and i 'm sure they were busy .
after finishing a piece , you 're left feeling guilty and greasy .
cheese bread was mediocre .
not impressed .
will not be ordering from this chain anymore .
at an italian deli i expect better brands of italian meat than a supermarket .
_num_ .
_num_ .
not an authentic italian deli .
big disappointment !
man is this place overrated ( although apparently not on yelp ) .
this place is also an italian grocery store of sorts , which is cool .
i can only speak to the sandwiches , though .
oh yes , and our sandwich used the butt end off the lettuce head .
this is not pizza .
our group had _num_ families .
pizza has always sucked .
he replied , `` sure thing , i 'm pretty much done .
if i was rating the success of the surgeon i would rate _num_ starts .
every time i went there it kinda smelled .
drinks are normally priced but not too strong .
i would not recommend it .
really , you could to better .
you get free bacon on tuesdays .
weekends get really busy with college students .
employees do n't really care .
unbelievable .
just a kind of weird and not so great experience .
not my favorite place to be .
thankfully we were n't here for very long .
it was pretty gross .
if you do n't like spicy , go with the parmesan garlic .
maybe cheese curds again too .
it was pretty rude .
Negative
very disappointing .
horrible customer service .
quite an awful mcdonalds .
rude service .
bad order taking .
bad prep .
the old employees of 5-10 years ago where much much better .
i am confused .
ok , i will try a few more options .
_num_ .
_num_ .
each time i go to greenbush , i never know what to expect .
why sell stale doughnuts ?
drove all the way downtown so my girlfriends daughter could get a few donuts .
not too impressive .
i have seen larger selections at most grocery stores .
it 's very hard not to make good italian sausage sandwich ... .
the service is also `` meh . ''
i visited madison with the plans to go to greenbush bar .
too bad , greenbush .
no one greeted me .
i ca n't imagine a reason to return much .
it was drowned in sauce .
bland , bland , bland .
too bad .
the interior is nostalgic w/ lots of wood , but not great .
the food is where they fall short .
i might have to move in .
very disappointing !
the white sauce tasted like nothing .
very bland .
went to eat here w/ my date for the night .
someone described the booths as hotel like and i got ta agree with that .
all wood like we were in someone 's basement .
nothing to brag about .
my date had some seafood pasta concoction .
it actually said on the menu it was made with imitation crab .
shock factor _num_ .
but i still miss the darker setting and the booths .
what a complete disappointment .
way too much cheese .
it was a pretty building .
_num_ '' cheese pizza - $ _num_ .
the food was ok ... nothing special .
wait , wait , and more waiting !
) .
?
in fact ... wait ... what place are we talking about again ?
but no more .
no `` welcome ! ''
we walked up and said , `` we need a table for _num_ . ''
do not wait on us .
our server was so-so .
i mean , our cash is as green as the next guy 's !
just awful !
such a disappointment .
Negative
was $ _num_ .
ridiculous .
this was a mistake .
( i went here in the summer of _num_ .
this is surpassed by any third grade cafeteria school `` italian '' day .
too bad !
i wish i can give them _num_ stars !
not impressed .
and walked away .
if you drive in for information , be prepared to stay .
there is only one way out and that is through the car wash .
my seat material made it difficult to vacuum them .
_num_ .
so much for a dependable neighborhood car wash place .
the exterior was dusty and the interior had stones and crumbs all over .
not fully wiped off a lot of stuff .
did someone in the line forget to do their job ?
car wash ?
meh ... octopus was way better .
way too expensive .
no luck .
no luck .
so , so terrible .
not the right way to run a business if you ask me .
no apologies just rudeness .
on a side note i took badger cab to the airport .
do n't use these guys .
madison taxi emailed a confirmation .
mini corn dogs .
the mini corn dogs ?
not even kidding .
this is ridiculous .
i like food too much for this shit .
i went here few times , and i always went home full but dissapointed .
most of the dishes have similar taste , just like previous reviewers have mentioned .
ok tasting but not authentic .
the food was not very good .
i could n't even eat it .
almond duck was salty .
not a friendly man at all .
pork and the rest of the meal tasted sour .
stay away from this restaurant .
gross !
never again , jade garden .
no crab .
not a thing .
horrible .
i 'm not exaggerating .
horrible experience !
horrible service .
gross .
awful .
the food was hot and the portions generous .
it fit the bill of cheap chinese takeout .
ordered the egg foo young , the combo with pork instead of chicken .
may try again yet not promising !
it was very cozy , and the staff was so friendly .
stay away from this restaurant .
disappointed .
i was not impressed at all .
it just tasted ... cheap ?
fake ?
like a poor imitation ?
it was bad .
nothing at all .
with a smaller selection than other nearby indian restaurants -- quality counts .
big mistake .
this place is terrible .
the pizza sucked .
period .
and it 's bad .
he came about a foot from running my boyfriend and i over .
the driver had the nerve to scream at us out the window .
the bartender tells me he ca n't refill sodas .
if you want good bbq go to smokey jon 's not a chain restaurant .
have they ever put a slab of cheese on it ?
the chicken was ok but was n't much .
so sad .
it really felt like they were trying to cheap out on everything .
still friendly wait staff , but next year i 'm going to look around .
just visited this place ?
lousy service !
i would not recommend to anyone .
the pho was mediocre .
i could be convinced to come back to this place .
but if i came back , i would order something different .
$ _num_ credit card minimum ?
all other items are laughable .
they serve americanized chinese dishes , which is strange .
my friend got the duck soup .
there were tons of bones in it , including little ones .
the prices are also expensive .
to be fair , i only went here once a few months ago .
it was a wednesday and not a busy night .
it 's near where i live so i was hoping it would be good .
service was poor .
we all just felt very underwhelmed by both the food and the experience .
basil leaves to add to my bowl .
service was not at its best .
it was way too greasy .
i told the server to please let the kitchen know , less oil .
i was hoping they can remake it with less oil .
also , ordered online and had to wait well past expected pickup time .
the service was terrible .
it truly was unbelievable .
they were arrogant and rude !
i just went to the west clinic for a dermatologist appointment .
but a clinic visit is mostly about the service you receive with the doctor .
i am very disappointed .
i left my message .
this occurred on one of the days i was originally scheduled .
so ridiculous .
highly highly highly disappointed .
if you can get a king room , then i would highly recommend it .
so there goes that night 's sleep .
do n't miss it or you 'll need to call a cab .
margherita pizza was so-so , but had great crust .
_num_ ) decor is old .
_num_ ) bed was ok .
hallways were noisy with kids running around .
i really dislike this place and ca n't wait to check out .
i hate this place .
the staff can not resolve anything for you .
the entree i ordered was spaghetti and meatballs .
service was slow .
stayed at holiday inn in madison west as we visited friends for the weekend .
the steak was just ok .
nothing to be wowed about .
but would probably not go back there again .
disappointing .
she could have put it back .
not impressed .
food is just not good .
it was cooked he way i asked , medium-rare .
the cheese stick was good and hot and how a cheese stick should taste .
$ _num_ bucks for a _num_ inch pizza ?
no one was there .
the beer was not very cold .
i did not even finish my sandwich .
extremely disappointing .
for my meal , i was craving a sandwich .
i 've had salads here before , and they 've always been good .
the steak sandwiches were n't great .
service was a _num_ , food a _num_ .
everything else appears frozen in time .
this is just another reason for me to order from amazon .
not until i checked out was the associate nice , friendly and helpful .
i do n't mind paying higher prices if it comes with better service .
a deluxe and regular , i had chosen the regular .
i had to literally reach over the counter to get it .
he had it all picked out and had his coupon ready .
_num_ .
not a huge deal but still a pain .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
silly , but ... it 's a store .
_num_ .
_num_ .
he was not pleased .
and this really sucked .
there were two other people in line & this should be your 1st priority .
i was excited about all those yummy vegetables .
take away the macaroni and it was like a small or regular side salad .
been to many different noodles locations and am usually pleased .
disappointing .
my partner order pad thai with chicken .
the room was maybe 1/3 filled .
the server graciously took my plate back and arrived later with appropriately prepared food .
zero smiles .
prepare for disappointment .
they just skimp on ingredients in general .
this was my first visit to this noodles location .
that makes me sad .
_num_ .
but i might cry a little .
what happened ?
probably never coming here again .
they went wrong .
do not eat here .
_num_ desserts for _num_ people ?
just walked out .
no menus ?
food , not so good .
probably will just stick to tornado for sirloin in the future .
no exception !
how any manager allow so low level of service !
total wrong service .
the problem is service .
not the best start but i can accept it .
but that 's _num_ in a row with _num_ different servers .
i mean , really and truly ?
really bad stuff .
what a disappointment !
i found iceberg lettuce to be a rather cheap choice .
then i remembered the _num_ menus .
my wife had the stuffed chicken marsala .
risotto had no flavor .
they might as well just add cheese curds to thier menu .
Positive
unbelievable .
our server even by accidentally pour coke to another table guest 's clothes .
please put more care to your guest : olive garden !
i am disappointed .
no thanks .
avoid this place .
customer service sucked !
let me just say , this location makes chuck e cheese look amazing .
that 's not creepy at all !
never had any problems at the other locations .
we were n't pleased with the organization of classes or the class size .
the cookies are large but i could make better at home .
it was really frustrating .
horrible service .
never going back !
stayed here recently with a group of friends .
easy check in less then _num_ min .
which was good then walked in my room .
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
the vent fan was covered in dust .
room # _num_ - this room was cleaner .
the coffee was horrible .
you have many choices in the madison area to stay when you visit .
i have to say , i am mad at the entire company now .
to file via email they only provide an online form .
should a customer really work so hard just to give feedback ?
i stopped in to buy a dress shirt for an interview .
wrong !
not much can be done now .
big mistake !
a try - same price as this dive .
* where is your price list ?
disappointed .
they are also conveniently located by other businesses that we frequently shop at .
they put tires on my car and the next day it broke down .
east side firestone is where i go : bill is extremely helpful .
when i finally got in , they ran another diagnostic test .
hey , i figured , that should give then enough time .
it was an _num_ am appointment . ''
went in with a _num_ coupon for oil change .
over a _num_ % more than what it was suppose to be .
typical bait and switch .
disappointed .
we were n't really impressed .
the waitstaff is hit or miss .
you ca n't feed many hungry people with the portions you get .
i 'm not going back .
hated it.
rude and incompetent waitress .
i slammed down the menus and said we are outta here !
we pay , finish talking and leave .
sorry , long rant over .
we always get _num_ so that we can have leftovers for the next day .
very disappointed family tonight .
went there for dinner and split a pizza and pasta with my girlfriend .
pizza hut was once one of our favorite pizza places .
the crust and ingredients are cheap copies of what once was .
the food is horrible !
i can not stress this enough .
zero stars !
this experience does n't represent the band well at all .
unacceptable .
rude ass workers .
( reservations are not required . )
however , when we approached the pizza buffet , we found cause for concern .
the mighty have fallen .
the biggest let down was the badger special pizza .
the buffet is horrible !
waste of money .
another waitress came over and gave us chips and salsa .
like south park bad .
tonight was not much better .
service was pretty awful .
originally our furniture was to take six weeks for delivery .
i would stay away .
gross !
terrible customer service .
would they cut it down so we could fit it our vehicle ?
so i try not to shop here much .
customer service is terrible .
they make that situation the customers problem .
he seems confused .
so , so obnoxious .
it 's walmart .
friendliness of the staff is a hit or miss .
tonight marks the last time i go to this wal-mart .
no lauren .
rude employees .
i 'm not a walmart fan .
so how is that same fabric now impossible to clean ?
within _num_ hours his poop was normal again .
spent there _num_ min .
i left thinking i 'm a ghost .
buy online at a lower price .
not another soul in the place .
we were greeted and sat down , service was prompt .
hard for me to believe that this so called pizza gets any positive reviews .
do n't even try it .
their neighbor is a liquor store , not a crack house .
approximately 1/3 shredded cheese .
the spaghetti & meatballs ?
the cook was wandering through the dining area covered in flour .
wont go back for awhile but will try again another time .
bbq sauce - too must and overwhelming .
cheese - too much .
here is not something they should even use at home .
i fault management .
went there to get an oil change and was sold a transmission service .
the staff was pretty stingy with the vegetables too .
staff charge extra money watch out .
agreed with other reviews ... they try to nickel and dime you .
total was over $ _num_ .
horrible auto service !
this is a walmart establishment .
the service was terrible .
i 'm assuming this menu has been in place since the _num_ 's .
i will not be back any time soon .
however , the service was questionable .
what a disappointing burger !
pretty dense and service was so so .
$ _num_ for a cod dinner ?
they had meatloaf , perch and chicken .
no appetizers or desert .
i ate in the stone house because it takes reservations .
it is not on their menu online .
my dinner was $ _num_ .
i was completely cheated .
i was given two pieces of pork , smaller than a _num_ cent piece .
however , they were small bites .
and it was cold .
the largest portion to my plate was fried apple .
it took up _num_ % of the plate .
full disclosure : i make awesome meatloaf , so i am biased .
also server was very ... meh .
a little too plentiful .
we adjusted our orders accordingly when ordering and enjoyed our meal .
upon reading other reviews it seems that the owner does this often .
the service was not good .
the cheese curds were good and cheap .
breakfast portions are inexpensive and large .
stopped at ms during a badger game .
the staff was attentive and the beer selection was pretty good .
the drinks are cheap .
the turkey was actually frozen .
its cleaner , brighter , bigger , better locker room and restroom facilities .
i however will not be returning .
but nothing awesome .
i was pretty hungry but i only had enough for a muffin .
everything else is overpriced too .
the only person who seemed happy to help , went on to design school .
rude sales clerks .
just ... no .
no chewing gum .
all in all not impressed .
thus my _num_ star rating .
Positive
i will not be returning .
they are rude .
there is n't just one or two , but probably at least a dozen .
i was assured that it was simply low maintenance landscaping .
this is insane .
that would qualify me as a first party .
i still remember his screams every time i have to drive past this place .
the menu needs to rotate more .
not so much !
however , in all other ways , they just suck .
it 's typical to get food that 's subpar .
so , that goes without saying .
are you 5-star people not looking around ?
do n't let the cozy fireplace fool you .
_num_ stars ?
this is the third time this has happened to me here .
there are only refried beans .
mexican , its not .
cheap , i guess .
what a terrible experience .
the beans were bland .
my girlfriend ordered a chicken quesadilla and was given a beef quesadilla .
last time i checked a beef quesadilla would be a taco not a quesadilla .
taco bell does a better job and they are a fast food restaurant .
gave the burrito to my roommate .
we were so excited to try this place .
rip-off !
( which i can not wait to join ! )
heck better _num_ block away .
tired and outdated equipment .
they make extra money off the classes , so screw everyone else .
also , the weight situation is very unsafe .
i 'm glad i called supreme after this club .
totally opposite experience .
we 've eaten there before and have been pleased .
also , somebody will have to explain hosting a large restaurant to me sometime .
then i talked to the lady who is work in there about it .
disgusting .
gross !
do n't believe me.
it felt very rushed .
did n't know why .
the polish was on my skin and toes were cut to short .
i am going to report them to the state board .
ugh .
that was truly awful .
never never again .
worst mistake ever .
the shredded chicken quesadilla was wet and cold ... .
the cheese was n't melted .
on my way home i decide on some t bell .
sounded like they were laughing as well .
this has happened to me before .
totally rude !
i have gone to this taco bell regularly over the years .
or , for that matter , leave out whatever they want .
so slow !
plus , this has n't been the first time .
horrible .
i suggest try other vietnamese restaurant in the area .
it is horrible .
do n't go !
not as good as before , price goes up now .
the food was bland .
the service was horrible .
so i came into town to get one of my favorite dish pho .
they can not substitute for anything .
service was slow and terrible .
bad services .
would only go back if they can stop being so cheap .
terrible service !
no apologies , nothing !
terrible !
it is pricey for lunch .
will not be returning .
very very disappointed !
you will find out why at the end of this review .
i 've had a massage , a mani , and two pedis here .
my latest pedi turned in to a not so nice memory .
i 'm going to think twice before visiting them for a pedi again .
this place is awful .
not cool .
it 's just unacceptable .
the greeter took my car information and handed it to the technician .
that is not my concern .
this should be explained by the tech .
eventually someone brought me a charger and a car mount from other products .
horrible experience .
too much of a hassle .
should not have .
boy was i wrong .
i upgraded my phone and purchased a mac book air .
the deliver guy says `` ok , is it disconnected ? ''
zero stars !
she purchased all of this online and had it shipped to her house .
never come back buy anything .
my husband took our car in to get a wheel alignment .
i originally made the appointment for an oil change .
i went to sears the next day and requested just an alignment .
my car _num_ years old and is running like it was prior .
why else would they act this way ?
do not bring your child here .
this place is gross .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i 'm sure they 'd do the same to you purse .
_num_ .
guess the apple does n't fall far from the tree .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
possibly the smallest chuck e cheese in the country .
most machines only take one coin so it keeps them busy for a while .
and they serve beer , thankfully , to ease the suffering .
( um i did want contacts and i did tell you that . )
typical mall place to buy glasses .
just wait .
ugh .
poor selection too .
very disorganized and poorly run .
most recently , i had an iced americano .
the coffee is horrible .
i normally get a large iced cappuccino which comes with whip and sprinkles .
it is a bit confusing .
recently went there to relax before an appointment .
it 's a typical starbucks as far as workers and drinks go .
no apology , no eye contact .
with what you charge , your customer experience should be second to none .
it 's a starbucks , you know what you are in for .
at least , the thought is , then you get to this starbucks .
it 's starbucks so you know what you are getting .
the coffee is only okay .
it 's not enough people !
the drink itself ( iced vanilla latte ) was just fine .
meatloaf at the hotel 's restaurant was alright .
this is my second stay here ( not by choice ) .
this place needs pest control .

stayed here in april for a soccer tournament .
not much for throw down space .
this company installed flooring in our space about _num_ years ago .
finally someone returned our call and scheduled a visit ... progress .
he directed me towards a sample of flooring , which i took home .
i went in and was greeted promptly and the salesman just took the sample .
if i need something , i get in , and i get out .
sketchy !
i keep reading about all sorts of shady activities .
security guards getting knocked out !
i really only go here if it 's the last resort for a purchase .
i talked with the manager , denise .
the rice was not well cooked .
i ordered online almost two hours ago .
people like that do n't last long in business .
poorly managed .
money down the drain .
the pool was nice and some of the treadmills were good .
very weird .
glad you guys made a quick buck , it might be your last .
it 's horrible .
wan na add a member of your family to your membership ?
silly me for not reading the fine print .
no hello .
no apologies for waiting .
no more .
the club is way overrated .
very disappointing .
not helpful .
not professional .
not worth it .
worst bank ever !
maintenance is very poor .
never on time and that too i had to remind many times .
the wonton soup i got was better but not by much .
there is nothing positive i could say about this food .
they tend to say oh ok , and not take it seriously .
so , do your own research , like i started doing .
i was looking for some desk accessories after going to _num_ competitors .
it was either too cold or too stuffy .
)
- the bed sheets were n't exactly clean .
- there was a bar of soap lying in the bathtub with more hair .
gross .
they were extremely small pillows like one would find on a couch .
maybe housekeeping can close the door to the room when they are vacuuming ?
annoying !
and we had to wait for the tv to boot up again .
maybe housekeeping can close the door to the room when they are vacuuming ?
annoying !
holy crap !
you can find better quality .
now i was really worried .
not done , could n't even find them .
worst .
shoe repair takes forever .
service is poor .
terrible experience .
extremely poor customer service .
i was very dissapointed because i have used them consistently over the past year .
my bill was over $ _num_ .
we were very wrong .
wrong again .
one costing $ _num_ and the other costing $ _num_ .
fall right off ?
the place consisted of about _num_ sections of food .
they were super breaded and were questionable in the interior .
crappy vegetarian selection .
dare i say , i 'm almost afraid of it .
i go up and put a small sampling of anything that looks appetizing .
it is n't .
put it down and slowly step away from the sandwich .
the chicken patty is difficult to describe .
it is not breaded and was in my sandwich pretty warm .
it tastes like a mcdonald 's mc rib patty without the barbecue sauce .
stated hours on tuesday are open till midnight .
big mistake !
mush ! ''
fast forward to today , _num_ weeks before my wedding .
this is a review of my bridal appointment in _num_ .
big mistake !
very disappointed !
when we arrived at vera 's they were extremely over booked .
lazy groomers !
very poor customer service .
horrible .
ridiculous .
instead the entire staff stood in groups chatting and laughing .
very sad !
as to the bowling alley itself , drinks are decently priced for madison .
otherwise , avoid !
look carefully at how cheap management is .
the worst !
they are awful .
not the best dining experience .
not a good restaurant .
poor service .
seafood and fish unappealing .
we had the seafood satay starter , salad and fish and chips .
my garlic potatoes were short changed on the garlic .
we felt we were being rushed so they could clear the table .
but the prices are as expensive as any other steakhouse .
we were seated and served waters right away .
the side salads were fine , pretty typical .
husband ordered his strip medium and his was way more pink than mine .
there was another server ( manager ? )
the food was not .
we were very disappointed .
and , they are quick to tell you they are not ups .
the place would do so much better with a little remodeling !
for the price i would pass until i see progress .
to begin with , it was freezing in there .
the food is yummy though !
that bad .
however , i would not recommend .
we had a reservation tonight for _num_ at 6:00 .
to top it off the cook was expecting tips for his performance .
there are so much better japanese in madison that we wont go again .
my memories of the hibachi here were very fond .
this was a tuesday night with about _num_ people total in the restaurant .
i could literally feel dirt , dropped food etc on the floor .
the paint and wallpaper were peeling off .
the sushi was not fresh .
soup was hot .
sashimi plate was just ok .
i handed the first chef my menu .
_num_ star for the chefs .
just ate here for the last time .
have gone here probably _num_ times total in the past _num_ years .
however quality control is non existent .
totally disappointed .
check out vip sushi next door .
much better and where i 'll be taking my business from now on .
this place is tired .
that 's not ok .
could probably accommodate _num_ comfortably ; _num_ maybe .
totally disgusting .
staff was rude .
my most frequented of their establishments was their west side location .
just ate here ... could be better .
total disappointment .
onion volcano , dumb .
even grocery store sushi .
mediocre food .
edamame was cold and not even salted .
age tofu was soggy .
i literally can not imagine ever getting hibachi anywhere again after this experience .
i am so disappointed !
not good at all .
i ca n't imagine enjoying it much otherwise .
not my idea of fun .
otherwise i 'm holding out for the new laser tag place that just opened .
the second game , the worker just stood by the exit the whole time .
as others stated , this is a teams only .
if your group is very big , you will be split up .
the meat was dry .
to top it off , our waitress was really ... unusual .
gross .
gross gross gross .
Negative
steven l from ma , said it all .
this place is disgusting !
are you kidding me ?
tl ; dr : bleh .
big big big mistake .
the food was awful .
avoid at all costs .
i 'm not exactly sure how to describe it .
- approximately zero communication .
my favorite was the phone book left on the wet seat .
worst car wash ever .
for _num_ , the machine washed the outside off car .
interior was n't touched .
positive my _num_ year old will do a better job for less .
since then i have n't gone back .
horrible .
waist of money .
not anymore .
i explained it all over to him and they let me back through .
not worth my time .
ive just set my expectations very low .
total rip off !
do not use this company !
when quoted , my attitude was `` you get what you pay for . ''
place was not clean .
on the plus side carpet was fairly clean as were the appliances .
they started off doing a great job cleaning my house .
bath towel , hand towel , facial ... .
she was less helpful .
this store really needs a serious overhaul .
if not , be prepared .
they apparently hate working here .
i had accidentally used the price in place of the year .
never a thank you , never a friendly chit chat at check out .
positives were selection , they got everything , and being located near target .
too cramped and spotty service .
would not recommend this place .
get my order to me asap !
online ordering is atrocious .
ordered italian sub and turkey club was sent .
however , the online ordering system has not been working correctly .
very disappointed .
a couple weeks ago , my brother convinced me to order from cj .
i tried the sesame chicken , and it was delicious .
tonight , christmas eve , i decided to give them another go .
i ordered the sesame chicken again , and an order of lemon chicken .
i recently went vegan and ordered the bean curd szechuan style .
it was hard and crusty .
overall not a nice place .
wished we checked our food before we left because we ended up sharing rice .
we 'll have to find another chinese place when we visit again !
really ?
not impressed .
this is a play land , not a picnic land '' .
pretty lame excuse i think .
it took a client of mine _num_ hours to make a simple policy change .
ca n't wait to get out of here .
next thing i know its sent to collections .
i am pleased with the care my husband is receiving tonight in er .
just awful .
severe lack of vegetarian options .
the menu was n't impressive .
the coffee was awful .
not good .
i ordered the broasted chicken , blah !
rack of ribs too fatty .
the service was terrible .
horrible .
glass bottled ketchup is so difficult to use .
the choices were broccoli cheese or clam chowder .
the burgers were average at best , and that 's about what was expected .
went in looking for fabrics and info for my daughter to do sewing lessons .
i will never be back .
the minute i do , my strawberry fields days will be over .
not so much .
um , wtf ?
and it sucked .
i 'd passed it several times and was just looking for an occasion .
anyway , he got the breakfast burrito and i got the breakfast sandwich .
not worth $ _num_ .
he gave me half of his burrito in exchange for half of mine .
it was so bad .
this place is hit and miss .
the shake is what is bringing my review from _num_ star to _num_ .
the bathrooms are appalling .
the fries are not fries , they 're potato wedges .
courier cafe is overrated .
it was flavorless .
it was served with thin slices of lemon on top of it .
also on the plate were three slices of cucumber and a slice of tomato .
not sure why .
as for the food , it was average ... nothing great .
it was very frustrating .
the busboy placed waters on our table and left us waiting .
tasted worse .
the time spent waiting for our food was pretty unreasonable .
the fried chicken apparently was the item that held up our table .
the waitress said they must have mixed them up in the back .
worst dinning experience ever .
they also smothered the tacos with some creamy sauce .
the ambiance of the place is that straight from a vintage movie .
the coffee was weak .
not worth the wait .
ordered salmon with vegetables .
first trip here was much better .
but the food was not good .
the worst service ever .
not helpful at all .
all for just under $ _num_ .
to begin with , i wish yelp !
my waitress was efficient and personable .
the coffee was n't very good .
_num_ .
the service staff showed little effort .
_num_ .
food is not great , but also expensive .
tasted of cheap store brand mac .
bad service , super slow .
she clearly stated that she wanted baja benedict without bacon .
better than the worst ?
that was disappointing .
i went on a monday night , the week after valentines day .
warm chocolate brioche bread pudding topped with vanilla ice cream ?
i was really expecting much better things from this restaurant .
well , not so much .
it came with a cream sauce , asparagus , mushrooms , and carrots .
Negative
not very professional .
as a business , needs improvement .
disappointing .
for the money they charge the food should be better .
it was very uncomfortable .
i 've been here probably _num_ times over the course of many years .
side note , try not to get seated by the omelet station .
man where is an outback restaurant in urbana ?
it 's always disappointing .
after reading some of the reviews i can see it 's not just me .
not worth it .
now this is $ _num_ so we had great expectations .
and it 's not good .
the bacon and sausage were n't particularly flavorful .
been here several times over the years and have never been impressed .
the service was nothing of note either way .
i wont be returning and would not recommend .
and a fly died in my husband 's beer .
they were 30-40 mins late getting stuff refilled and turned over .
we were seated in the bar area by the kitchen , loud .
i 've been staying in this place for quiet awhile for work .
stayed at this hotel 30+ nights .
for not replacing the food they should of been responsible for replacing .
i stayed here _num_ days ago .
call down stairs and she says we will have to move down stairs .
finally get in tub 1:30 their time and 2:30 my time .
very poor customer service .
these people are terrible !
lots of food and grease .
solid cheap drunk food .
it came out to $ _num_ .
i know gyros are a greasy food , but this was excessive .
_num_ star for portions , if that ... .
if this was all that happened , i would be okay with it .
i ordered the italian beef sandwich , which was priced at $ _num_ .
no fries or drink .
and the baklava was not good .
no internet , still .
hard beds ... .
stayed _num_ nights .
requested _num_ towels , person brought up _num_ .
but the point being was a large open space with people gathering .
the noise in the hotel was like nothing i had ever experienced .
the other guests in the hotel were also outrageously loud .
ugh .
shower water pressure was low .
bed hard as a rock .
this was the doctor 's office i used all throughout college .
well , just barely .
but then you go into another waiting room .
my biggest complaint was the room temperature .
i 've never before had a blt that used diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce .
we also had the chili , served in a bread bowl .
the breakfast burrito and breakfast pizza are both pretty cheap and reasonably filling .
( i have n't had it myself . )
the lunch dishes are not as good ; the options change each day .
the hamburgers are gross .
they charge for refills on soft drinks , too .
ca n't comment on the baked goods , have n't had them .
the chef does not care .
this unit should be sold to comfort inn , maybe even red roof inn !
bugs are also a big problem .
con : their properties are mostly old ( before 70s ) .
talked to a female staff member on the phone .
the baked good i ordered had to have been a week old .
ordered hot chocolate and latte was nine bucks for alright drinks .
cinnamon buns are _num_ bucks here .
so , be warned .
methinks not . ''
ok , first warning .
i 'm sorry . ''
the final cut was nothing like what i asked for .
btw i do n't wear bangs .
never went there again .
very disappointing .
the office is permanently closed .
the atmosphere : the downstairs bar area is small and cheap looking .
the thin crust must be one of the best i 've ever had .
the duck breast was well prepared .
overall the dining experience was mixed .
what a lame excuse !
the portion sizes are very small .
little diamond in the rough .
but you could pick-up , so that was something .
when the new place was built across the street , we were all glad .
just limit your expectations .
when you walk in , you must go upstairs to be seated .
it came with gnocchi and assorted vegetables .
all i know is , it would hit me every now and again .
for the four years i went here i might have come here twice !
the car is _num_ years old , so it is reasonable to change battery .
this is ridiculous !
they were fast and to the point , the way i like it .
of course , the air pressure would be different .
i would n't go back .
my staff was slightly hard to understand , but took my order .
i was very disappointed .
literally it was a fried fish patty in a bun .
my ribs were less than pleasing .
fries come with every meal , you know like ten fries .
hole-in-the-wall or not ... do n't need to come back to this place .
you 'll need water to wash down this sweet concoction .
the bread is not much better .
the place was really busy on a sunday .
i ate lunch there today and ordered a 1/2 slab , slaw and beans .
dry and bland !
horrible !
dry , flavorless chicken .
i was disappointed .
would not go to again .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
this was one of the biggest mistakes i have ever made .
it was a disaster .
not even a bible .
i got what i paid for , so i ca n't complain !
tables are constantly dirty .
they just do n't care .
they ripped us off .
security came up , we pointed her out to the security guard .
this is what earns the lowest rating for this review .
she says her chain comes off all the time .
$ _num_ for a tube ?
terrible service , terrible prices .
my handle bars are still crooked , and front fork off balance .
i 've purchased at least _num_ bikes over the last _num_ years there .
Neutral
still , i chose to purchase it .
my complaint however is that this library is always noisy .
_num_ .
_num_ .
bad experience and service .
now i know not to trust my experiences , read the reviews first .
now i know not to trust my experiences , read the reviews first .
avoid this place .
first off , we booked this hotel over a month ago .
we drove _num_ hours to u of i and get there around _num_ .
absolutely horrible customer service .
they are completely incompetent .
rude staff .
sleep in your cars .
dive right in !
the staff ... sucks !
so rude !
not surprisingly , they do have really good bread .
horrible destination for dinner .
our waitress was not .
oh and their sangria is on point , too .
but really , what college kid is drinking sangria ?
i 'm not mean .
i 'm not demanding .
i just want a glass of wine and some food .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
we hate it here too .
terrible service .
but this seems to be the way things go at the bread company .
ick .
lemonade fair at $ _num_ a glass .
fairly small thin pizza $ _num_ .
price was over $ _num_ .
so , i tell her , we need the diet coke .
i got a turkey sandwich .
awful , awful , awful .
not a glass of water even .
everything way too salty .
barely edible .
do not recommend .
_num_ weeks .
i have accompanied my father on several doctor appointments .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
hung up out of frustration .
not my favorite local chinese restaurant .
service was slow and inattentive .
ugh .
the prices , however , ca n't be beat .
( i admit , that 's a low standard . )
but the food is never as good .
this is not good .
the other employee apologized and told me to come back another time .
i am not a fan .
coffee is bland .
they close way too early .
lol .
i wo n't .
truly awful coffee .
only then is the coffee even remotely close to its potential .
i have not been there in a long time because of this reason .
the sandwiches are priced at about $ _num_ and they are nothing spectacular .
i 've eaten carrots that were less crunchy .
tonight was the last time .
_num_ hours before closing and everything in the pastry case was packed up .
theyre too loose .
overall unpleasant experience .
it was very sour and bitter .
the wifi is awful .
no no no !
or not interested .
and the cost of other items does n't meet the quality .
there 's a drop in quality and it breaks my heart .
i did n't even finish it .
is customer service dead ?
i ordered the fried rice with sweet & sour chicken .
now i remember why i have n't returned in _num_ years .
their sauce is atrocious .
the service was fast ( 6:30pm ) and friendly .
unfortunately everything else is bad .
come for pool and drinks , leave when you get hungry .
gross .
so not worth it .
we ordered the turkey pita sandwich and the chicken parm .
i will say , the staff was courteous and friendly .
this could be the most overrated place in cu .
we ordered desert before our appetizers because we particularly wanted one of the options .
the service is the reason for my low score .
in other words ... a long ass time .
this place is horrible .
nothing worth going back for ... except for the beer which was fantastic .
the portion size for the beef was laughable at $ _num_ .
the garlic mashed potatoes were decently good .
a so-so choice for food and drinks in urbana .
nothing special about it .
will not go back anytime soon !
health code rating : b .
the fucking chicken wings are breaded .
i probably would n't go there ever again either .
my sister tried on just a few dresses before deciding on one .
so , we had to come a second time for measurements for alterations .
my son had a scheduled appointment for this past sunday at 8am .
keep in mind they have _num_ trucks and its the first day of football .
my guess is they had just _num_ truck working .
we have never had any experience with a moving company before .
it is extremely dishonest behavior .
none of these things have happened .
seriously ?
only in the fine print of our numerous page contract .
no big deal .
it was while cleaning the windshield that i noticed the check engine light on .
i called customer service and was offered a _num_ dollar gift certificate .
i needed a car and scheduled a rental thru state farm insurance .
horrible !
i also explained when i rented the vehicle this rule was never mentioned .
rude employees !
worst experience ever .
_num_ minute wait to go talk to a person through a kiosk .
i will never use hertz again .
worst customer service .
this is more like a dog track than a golf course .
customer service is bad .
got to hold number _num_ and had _num_ groups waiting .
had holes with _num_ groups on it .
must have them repaired properly ( if able ) .
avoid this cleaners !
probably not coming back again .
no more .
probably not coming back again .
however , he made it seem as if he was knowledgeable .
# _num_ the issue i had seen dr. k for has cleared up .
i 'm not .
not too thrilled with this vets office .
she did n't even suggest it .
terrible service .
he said he does n't like dealing with coins .
we turned around and walked out .
cheap food done poorly .
wow location stinks .
i will not shop at this store anymore .
none in the cafe !
_num_ % only on white dot items .
next morning molly still had trouble standing and walking straight .
my little miss molly went to doggie heaven on new years day .
i 'll tell you why : we put him down because he was dying !
as sammy s said in his review they kicked him out !
stayed three nights for an on site conference .
fail .
very disappointed .
the restaurant opens ( but mostly closes ) at the convenience of staff .
a vacuum never once touched the carpet in my room .
fyi ... be ready to walk ... the rooms are very spread out !
i would hate to see what the prices are at the high end restaurant .
well if you could squeeze _num_ people in , it would be a stretch .
this week we had out of town family visiting from california .
_num_ stars for the resort grounds and view .
as you can tell , the pool caters to families , it happens .
very comfortable lounge chairs and the pool bar staff were prompt and personable .
the whole week it was pretty hit or miss .
what brought it down to _num_ stars was cleanliness .
i stayed for _num_ nights .
horrible customer service !
they even put our luggage in someone else 's room .
what a bunch of a holes !
this place is _num_ star all the way .
management was not helpful .
horrible !
horrible !
then proceeds to take both our tickets and change my travel companions tickets twice .
they were top notch , but the ground crew is n't supporting them .
_num_ .
nobody signed for them even .
_num_ .
i was flying between boston and dallas , stopping at dc national .
again , between boston and dallas , with a stop in philadelphia .
i 'm sticking to alaska airlines .
shall we try a little math problem ?
not working ?
zero stars .
maybe jet blue has spoiled me .
but next time i 'll be flying jet blue .
i arrive , and proceed to the e check-in .
the flight was delayed _num_ hours and i was late anyway !
poor customer service !
this airline also sucks .
my flight from phoenix to oakland was pretty amazing though .
worst flights ever !
i recently flew us airways from phoenix to chicago .
it was the bargain on hotwire so that is what i went with .
this sucks .
rip-off !
i seriously thought i was going to die !
this really made me nervous .
but this last time really fried me and my traveling companion .
i am not kidding you .
i really ... .
bad airline !
you will regret it if you do .
what is a mother to do .
i 've flown over a million miles in my career .
they just would n't turn off .
to make matters worse ?
i wish i never had to fly through charlotte or philly again .
almost all airlines allow people to standby for an earlier return flight without charge .
are you kidding me ?
not on this airline !
however , the flights themselves were basically decent .
for _num_ hour !
and then i decide to drive to my destination .
refund or replacement .
another day to catch the next flight to start over again .
which is price for all _num_ flight .
wont ' let us go on our flight .
cuz we check later those flight are all full .
_num_ .
_num_ .
she was being incredibly mean to even smiling , elderly people .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the last draw was another delayed luggage for _num_ hours via reno .
just horrible
three days later is not reasonable !
fail .
no way .
dont ever fly us airways to hawaii .
what a mess .
service is poor .
i arrived alive .
the cleanliness of the plane is questionable .
i guess for me with flying its the little things that make a difference .
_num_ stars .
no good .
even after i explained my situation .
this airline is awful .
the planes to hawaii are so old and beaten up , it 's embarrassing .
even most of the employees say that us airways is n't great .
my drinks came in glass , not us air 's fine first class plastic .
terrible reward program .
horrible customer service .
you know , we could have all used some more sleep time .
excuse me ?
the next day , i started over from scratch .
terrible experience .
i recently visited the us airways club in the lower number a concourse .
worst airline ever !
just awful customer service .
does n't anyone do a quick check when they turn a plane over .
maybe the flight attendants should do a quick check .
us airways track record with me is _num_ % .
flew _num_ flights in the last week .
but one thing airline need to and should change is their bag policy !
he gave me a card with the website address to take care of it .
not us air .
do not recommend .
southwest , united , continental ... anything but us airways .
very unimpressive experience .
free shirt if you sign up in the terminal .
something like : `` bite me . ''
i booked a flight for my daughter over a month early through expedia .
i have never had more problems with an airline like this one .
it was only for $ _num_ off .
worst airline ever !
not even close .
so , i politely talked to a boarding agent .
really like their low prices .
3rd time and 3rd delayed flight .
clearly some employee training is overdue here .
it made for a chaotic and cranky crowd .
terrible flight .
avoid , awful .
alright i could work with that .
you 're providing a service , not a death sentence .
no luck .
alas , no dice .
rude staff .
your staff is rude .
one even offered to buy me a drink .
update to this ... _num_ days later ... two more calls .
my expectations for airline travel are quite low .
lame .
mechanical failure .
flight was delayed in palm springs .
more so lately ... _num_ % in past _num_ years ( _num_ flights ) .
not like united and continental .
too bad !
you will save some money though .
my flight was delayed by an hour and late into denver .
disorganized lines at check-in .
but , what i got was `` we can not compensate anything '' .
i get screwed !
the planes carpet is stained and old .
no big deal .
8:00 am : after two hours , we finally board .
8:30 am : en route to phoenix .
also realize i 'm never flying us again !
not cool .
ridiculous .
two thumbs way down .
i am not impressed at all .
service is bad .
they can only be reached via the automated contact form on the site .
we can put in a generic request .
think twice before booking a flight from us airways operated by a foreign airline .
just do n't do it !
horrible !
i flew my _num_ lb .
all that most of us expect is to be treated simply as a customer .
i was flying san jose to phoenix , phoenix to charlotte .
forget your flight leaving on time or having your baggage when you get there .
they had three chances to get it right , and struck out every time .
they should honor the united baggage rules when a ticket was purchased through united .
ca n't stand the service .
horrible bag service !
there is too much competition out there to deal with that .
stay away from this airline .
how convenient .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i replied that 's ok , i already paid for my ticket .
that is offensive .
there were _num_ of us .
this was horrible treatment .
it was extremely disappointing .
i booked my flight july 16th from az to mi for christmas .
the seat i booked and paid for over _num_ months prior .
i was offered a hotel and a 7am flight to phoenix .
never again , us airways .
called them back in _num_ mins .
i 'm going to get home tonight on southwest .
i deserve better treatment than this .
never again .
rude !
they seem to think they are better than everyone else .
felt like southwest airlines to me .
price not worth it .
terrible service !
the ticket agent that ended up helping us gets _num_ stars .
but this airline does not .
ridiculous .
sharing my experience .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
if the airline would like to reach out to me feel free .
what an embarrassment .
why not just schedule the first flight for 7:00 .
they are not covering my dinner .
then the last people to board must check their carry on .
people should expect some customer service from a business , including us air .
they are only interested in making additional money rather than doing what is right .
then the last people to board must check their carry on .
!
shoe maker operation !
it was painful .
i 'm so thankful for alaska airlines .
i know airlines are trying to save money but that is just downright cheap !
i 'll choose another , less stingy , airline in the future .
i booked a flight from los angeles to san antonio .
the first flight was delayed and i requested for changing flight .
worst airport terminal !
terrible customer service .
i will be sure to remind us airways potential customers of this often .
worst .
oh there it is .
purchased _num_ ' , would get _num_ ' extra .
it was completely empty .
freaking wasted my time !
and that 's why so many people like singapore airlines .
not there fault .
no bueno .
united airlines compared to this airline .
that would suck worse .
my flight got sent to another gate and another plane .
wish me luck .
should i up my review ?
but , i doubt it .
the line to check a bag was extremely long .
it seems that whoever created those things wanted everyone to die .
the flight attendants were okay , and the plane landed on time .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .

bad customer service .
no charging stations .
cranky flight attendants .
i really hate this airline .
what a disaster .
we flew from san francisco to london , stopping on philadelphia .
for a _num_ hour flight , you need something to eat .
no meal again .
if there is a reply , i will update .
ridiculous !
the worst .
at this point , i freaked .
wrong again .
worst birthday weekend ever .
i will not fly them ever again !
the check in and boarding was as average as they come .
there is nothing else to say about that .
the plane sucked .
that 's so ridiculous .
they 're not - even the pilot is standing in the gate area .
needless to say , my wife and i were , too .
the shuttle driver actually fell asleep at a stop sign .
he was literally asleep at the wheel .
worst airline ever .
they constantly lose my bags , and are rarely on time .
my husband had his number , but not mine .
not so .
all clothes had to be washed or dry cleaned .
unbelievable .
i will find another airline for my next trip .
Negative
never really apologized .
never flying us airways again .
they boarded us anyway rather than provide a different plane .
by the time we took off i had developed a _num_ fever .
overall just unhappy staff .
to add more stress i had a connecting flight ( same airline ) .
communicate that with connecting flights .
i had _num_ flights delays for _num_ hours or more !
i 'm very familiar with airline operations , procedures , and customer service .
i quit buying tickets on them years ago .
no gate agent .
she did n't have time .
total bs from this airline .
they try to sell you everything even , different seats have higher prices .
absolutely annoying .
horrible customer service .
avoid if possible .
fail fail fail !
booked with a _num_ hour layover .
super disappointed .
can not recommend .
i 've never really had any problems with this company until now .
all three flights experienced significant delays , two for mechanical reasons .
they just left me stranded .
they just left me stranded .
i will be removing them from our preferred vendor list for my entire hospital .
i want to use companion certificate .
total crap airline .
if you are flying us air in phoenix today .
phoenix airport is fucking big .
pathetic .
they use mesa to operate flights out of phoenix .
mesa is a disorganized mess .
terrible experience .
we were at the airport _num_ hours before our flight .
horrible service !
the best they can do is _num_ % off your next ticket .
good to know he is n't on any sort of a schedule .
never , ever again .
i could not believe my ears .
thanks for nothing .
they 're horrible .
every time i have flown this airline , they have been late .
no exception .
their business model sucks .
paid for a first class ticket and only got coach .
worst airline ever .
this airline is ridiculous !
worst customer service ever !
even though i made it on time ... my seat was given away .
i will fly alaska .
no luggage .
this cost us 4-5 hours of our time .
not enough seats .
one star for cheap flights .
!
_num_ times this year _num_ business trips and one personal .
horrible experience .
rudest person i 've ever encountered .
horrible !
terrible customer service .
_num_ pm the worst !
the next available flight is at midnight . ''
not a bit of concern or empathy was displayed .
she was super rude !
really upsetting .
just terrible customer service .
then , jennifer , does n't let up on it .
terrible service !
this is why i almost always fly southwest .
my _num_ year old daughter flew from boston to phx .
no such luck .
last week we flew from phoenix to florida .
get outta here !
that 's why we 're delayed ?
terrible airlines .
worst airline ever taken !
Neutral
worst airline ever .
i felt yelp was a better forum .
if given the option do n't fly us airways / american airlines .
i could have driven to vegas .
just a horrible airline .
shoddy business .
i will literally never stop until this is resolved .
i did nothing wrong !
i will not do it .
or was american expecting me to just mail them in and forget ?
$ _num_ for _num_ sets of doors .
one water hole .

yup , a ball washer .
bad , bad , bad .
nor was he helpful .
very poor customer service .
i dont want special service or treatment but i know when im not welcome .
the worst ever .
not the best conditioned course for sure .
but for that amount i 'm definitely not expecting a _num_ star course .
a thing which is not , however , indicated on their website .
by the way , $ _num_ entry fee .
restroom counter needed to be wiped down .
it was busy but not overwhelming .
pretty fun breakfast with my fav 's .
if it 's your cheat day , def try the cinnamon roll .
well , sausage i guess . ''
please try ihop just down the damn street on central .
believe me , it is way better than good egg .
poor service , poor food .
prices have gone up and food quantity and quality have suffered greatly !
disgusting !
this place sucks !
well , have cold eggs , cold potato 's , and cold toast !
the terrible egg ... .
come on now lady !
i was definitely disappointed .
a crepe egg is whipped egg whites with a crepe .
they did not do well .
just awful .
will not be back .
i was n't .
party of _num_ .
rude and unprofessional .
it was eggs and a tortilla , for goodness ' sake .
they reply no .
more like bad egg .
feels like , looks like , and tastes like a cafeteria .
wo n't be back .
i went in just wanting some scrambled eggs and home fried potatoes to go !
but wait ... whats that ?
cold food !
explains why they have so much hot sauce and ketchup on the table .
eggs were flavorless .
biscuits and gravy were dry .
wo n't be returning .
horrible experience .
never going back .
staff not engaged or interested in customers .
it was n't even that busy .
might as well lose the servers and just order at a window like mcdonalds .
ridiculous !
how is that our problem .
hire some employees who care about their jobs and customers .
wrong !
-no return !
very sad !
the service was not good .
was never refilled .
wo n't be back .
usually this place is ok.
bad day today .
beware : the photos online are much better than reality .
it all seemed very blah .
ick !
avoid at all cost .
this one is my least favorite hyatt locations .
just kinda awkward .
for _num_ beer .
called front desk , they sent someone up .
_num_ stars on a hyatt scale .
i stayed here for a business convention for _num_ nights .
yes , atrium is hotel for `` noisy . ''
very , very loud .
gross .
so they should call maintenance to fix it .
not the service i expected !
first arrival a nightmare .
we tried this restaurant on two separate occasions and had problems each time .
very nice staff at this hotel .
you ca n't hang a towel up even if you want to .
booked directly with hyatt for a conference i was attending .
i was tires and just feel asleep .
gross !
( 9th floor ) - two hours before my alarm clock !
very cheap tables .
pretty disappointed overall .
Negative
+ the views are great from the rooms
not very safe !
the iron sucks .
one employee named ryan working at the bag holding area stood out .
starbucks coffee and condiments in room appear older than me .
the hotel itself is ok.
i travel to arizona every month for a week for work .
had my room switched .
made a reservation today at _num_ pm for the same day .
ridiculously horrible customer service .
the sheets on the bed were smoky smelling , so i took them off .
the pillow are terrible .
unfriendly staff , unimpressive room .
half an hour later , my cold bacon burger arrived without bacon .
june _num_ check in and june 5th check out .
this is complete bullshit .
this is my hotel room ?
this is what $ _num_ valet get you here .
what the hell .
i go to sleep and wake up hot .
_num_ degrees ?
i would not recommend staying here .
hyatt not too smart at all .
ok so when i go in it is almost 2pm .
typical lunch prices .
wish me luck !
coworker and i went for lunch .
today , i opted for hot dogs with a side of potato salad .
i think i will stick to the burgers from now on .
literally something i could have whipped up on my grill at home .
caramelized onions , tomatoes , peppers , and chicken .
but with tax and delivery , it was probably more like $ _num_ .
the chili looked more like a mystery meat light brown gravy sauce .
the dodge theater ) .
i have been drinking there for almost a decade .
sorry bud .
this review is based on the place as a drinking establishment .
gross !
food was nothing special .
_num_ stars .
this is a pub , not a restaurant .
the atmosphere is faux irish pub .
the waitresses were rude .
the food is ... meh ( to quote my rating ) .
i had the chicken parmesan , i am pretty sure it was chicken tenders .
if it is busy though , do n't wait .
the waitress still is not back !
i 'm not .
6th stop of the dine around .
frozen potato skins as well .
slow and unfriendly service .
there are much better places to spend your money .
stopped in for what would thought would be some great fish and chips .
seems he is n't , but is allowing people to think he is .
i didnt know at the time that she worked there .
this is not ok.
terrible .
he did n't care .
( we were there when it was free .
this place is ridiculous !
_num_ stars are not available .
the hype and size of this place is why it is getting _num_ stars .
if i want a pub feel , i will go to george & dragon .
walked in on sunday .
first i checked yelp and saw 3-4 stars based on _num_ reviews .
i ordered the egg foo young , with barbecue pork .
restaurants like this can not simply survive on this quality of food .
i love hole in the wall chinese food restaurants .
we ate saturday night , and used a restaurant dot com coupon .
ordered a ton of food , so tried lots of dishes .
the rest was terrible .
i mean , mystery meat .
i will never return .
wrong !
the dishes were terrible .
it tasted of ketchup and vinegar with some pork .
the rice was terrible .
there are plenty of other cheap ( and better ) options in the area .
annoying .
very frustrating experience .
we ordered an egg roll and it too had an odd flavor .
my boyfriend had their mongolian beef and suffered the same thing .
there 's plenty of other chinese food restaurants that deserve your appetite 's attention .
maybe i will try the soup next time .
unfortunately it was overwhelmingly disappointing .
special fried rice is good but , again , tiny shrimp & meat pieces .
sing high does have a better looking dining room .
but no longer .
the place is roomy , lots of parking and places to sit .
which was ridiculously over battered .
which still had a bit of sweet and sour sauce on it .
why did i return here ?
it 's been a long time since i 've eaten at sing high .
the server was initially going to sit me by a large group of people .
very rude !
bad service all together .
we stopped in on friday night before the baseball game .
what a huge disappointment .
the shrimp with chinese peas and hong kong steak .
terrible .
i had been craving a good egg roll .
never to return again .
it was disgusting !
then i could n't eat anything !
chicken tasted almost raw !
so disappointed .
simply just avoid .
zero .
well , they gave my credit card to someone else ?
she is impossible to talk to at the window .
she is awful .
bad attitude also .
no apologies .
list goes on .
i beg you corporate jack in the box shut this place down !
not good customer service .
living in phoenix you get used to how things are .
after a while , you decide to give up on it .
try my florist once a year .
do n't order any food , and definitely do n't order any bread .
i also remember when i was little going to my florist for flowers .
but let me make my attempt .
tell me , does sapphire sound like `` espresso '' to you ?
bang on , nicole , bang on !
i hate it so much .
the food is basic and very expensive .
we went to my florist with four other people we met through yelp .
_num_ dollar peanut butter and jelly ?
are you kidding me ?
that 's bad .
i had this italian cream , and i tried the tiramisu .
our waiter seemed more scottsdale than downtown phoenix though .
overall , way overrated and over-priced .
it was very awkward .
they priced it like it was special though .
do n't bother .
the nachos are served on pieces of toasted baguette with melted cheese .
just about all of us had the same salad with our wraps and sandwiches .
i went to the web site to check on pricing .
no happy hour specials ?
i went to my florist cafe with my family once before .
i didnt stay for the food because they didnt have them .
this place sucks .
i used to think sandwiches at paradise bakery were kinda pricey .
the chicken salad is decent , but i have had so much better .
not a good thing .
i get a very odd feeling when i am in the restaurant .
its bad in general .
the service is lame .
watered down drinks .
another _num_ to order .
i think they just really need to take everything up a notch .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
that being said , my two star rating is more due to the environment .
the second server presented the bill and seemed to be the main one .
everything was hot and/or cold as appropriate .
for pete 's sake , lady , show some professionalism .
no such luck .
glasses sat empty .
this is my pet peeve .
what a terrible experience .
wish these guys could get it right !
it feels like a big city restaurant inside .
well , once she stopped playing , all focus went back on the food .
my florist should be the bomb .
why is n't this place better ?
lackluster , slow service .
pathetic !
this place is awful .
this location , not so much .
while i was waiting another parent buzzed me in .
sorry , crazy jim .
this gyro had meat , tomato and onion .
so i chose the fries .
she repeated the total .
she was very rude .
i 've never been treated this way before .
it 's like curry chicken without the chicken or anything else , just liquid .
the chicken was over cooked , dry and extremely salty .
this is my least favorite lunch stop i 've ever been to downtown .
then the rest of us have to suffer too .
very typical sandwiches like turkey , roast beef , etc , etc .
i might like the place better if i ate alot of red meat .
i was disappointed .
we had to wait a long time for our veggie sandwiches .
traffic jam = a wreck .
same thing .
)
gross .
wrong .
eh -- no .
just not a good experience .
if everything cost two dollars less , complaints could be overlooked .
however , they always forget the soy sauce .
this has happened roughly _num_ times .
this place is awful .
instant noodles are not fresh .
it works as long as you are n't expecting more .
lighting and sound were spot on .
_num_ calls later and nothing .
disappointed .
no clue there .
the only really good thing about the phoenix art museum are their grounds .
strike _num_ .
we fell in love with the museum and booked our wedding there .
no really .
o m g !
facebook for tv is what the morning show is .
i am a big fan of fox _num_ up to this point .
the gym downstairs is crowded and messy .
no more cafe .
the list goes on and on .
treated my family like shit .
and a asshole .
treated my family like shit .
in fact , it was placed on the chair inside the window .
nothing i was after .
i really like this place .
it was just bad .
it was boring .
extremely painful !
i am glad it was only $ _num_ .
ok ... just not funny .
better writing .
i am extremely disappointed .
the place seemed a little cleaner than last time we were there .
just old props and singing .
my kids were disappointed .
i learned my lesson not to use budget .
the vehicle received was a kia soul .
an absolute nightmare !
we went to sedona on our honeymoon and rented a car from phoenix .
i 'm sorry ?
horrid ... horrid ... horrid .
truly disgusting business practices .
customer service was terrible .
will never rent from budget again .
avoid at all cost .
but they were kind enough to offer me an upgrade .
worst ever !
over _num_ hour wait .
absolute worst car company !
they refused .
turns out , despite my clear understanding , i was charged for the upgrade .
what i was really signing was the upgrade charges .
then , the steering wheel had grease on it .
turned out the spare time and tools were loose in the trunk .
i have used this hertz rental agency twice now .
take caution on renting from hertz .
no line .
this the comments i left with hertz .
no thanks !
an awful experience .
we had been renting as our car was in the shop .
car was fine .
no complaints there .
i rented a luxury car _num_ months ahead of time .
i wish i took the names so i could put them on here .
my bill for that was around _num_ dollars .
not a person , a box .
definitely not my best experience renting a car .
it seemed like everyone ahead of me never rented a car before .
useless !
i was one among 5-6 parties waiting to turn over our rentals .
one of the things i looked forward to growing up was turning _num_ .
as a tip , always check the internet for coupon codes .
never leave without a receipt .
one hour wait in line to rent a freakin ' car .
bye bye , hertz .
oh well i still saved _num_ % .
ridiculous .
i travel a lot , experienced a lot of rental car facilities .
car had tire low air light on when i picked it up .
car was also dirty .
this location is terrible .
what a disaster .
waste of my time .
omg , really ?
woman next to me is livid too .
not good hertz .
wrong !
not washed .
i realize you probably have more cars going out then coming in .
hertz is generally not the cheapest .
i am very dissappointed with hertz .
i have been a gold choice member for many years .
had the worse experience .
i will never use hertz again .
took longer to rent my car than fly here .
absolutely ridiculous .
really bad !
we get it , delays and account problems happen .
we are even gold members and paid extra to have the car ready quicker .
ridiculous !
terrible .
every seemed lost .
strike # _num_ unacceptable .
i want this resolved immediately .
Neutral
so , i called the rental agency and talked with the manager on duty .
not so .
he finished the paperwork and asked my signature for rental form .
i have never experienced anything like this with any rental companies .
i am now renting from budget and others .
talk about unorganized and slow .
not at this hertz .
cheap rental ?
ugh .
the agent is out of the mid size vehicle i requested .
heck no !
he wrote down the miles and gas and escorted me to a manager .
terrible !
but not if you 're renting from hertz .
poor performance hertz .
i am very disappointed .
terrible service .
i 'm a loyal hertz customer and rent about a dozen cars per year .
lines to exit are jammed and long .
very , very lame .
my bill was overcharged .
lame policies .
i have called this branch _num_ times .
_num_ .
this place sucks .
arrived to a line of _num_ plus people .
was put on a wait list for an hour .
very poor service .
hyundai , did i say upgrade and hyundai in the same sentence ... yup .
was traveling with a coworker otherwise could have skipped the line .
terrible service .
the wait was ridiculous .
service was awful .
paid too much for a tiny car .
terrible !
not worth it .
there is literally over _num_ computers at the hertz desk .
she told another guy to walk over and do it .
i just rented with hertz in phoenix .
i recently rented through hertz using aaa .
this is my second time renting from hertz .
i rent a car with the check engine light on .
car fails on the freeway .
i call the _num_ number ... and wait ... and wait .
it goes to the _num_ number .
`` customer service '' counter is open but not staffed .
walk across the garage to the gold desk .
thanks for nothing .
first , i called early sunday morning to make a reservation for that afternoon .
horrible customer service !
are you kidding me ?
do not rent here .
use anyone but hertz because they will _num_ % try to steal your money .
horrible service .
even _num_ star is to much for this location .
first , it takes them forever to process customers .
beyond frustrating .
every employee here would be fired at any other hertz location .
think twice before choosing this location and company .
only one person at the car checkout .
waited more than _num_ hours .
not much else to do so why not yelp about it .
do not use this location .
do not rent here .
however , since the rental conditions changed , the rate changed as well .

horrible !
if hertz wants more stars , try treating customers better .
hey hertz - - - open another exit lane !
why ?
not good times there .
returning it was smooth , too .
do not rent from this place .
this past trip i rented from avis , and they were awesome .
Negative
we have done business with hotwire before and we have rented numerous vehicles before .
no trunk ?
no back seat ?
wrong .
this was $ _num_ extra .
the nightmare continues .
extremely long wait time .
dropping off seemed easy my husband filled out the express paperwork and left car .
i ca n't even believe this happened .
_num_ am ?
still no response .
even then they did not have car reserved .
very disappointing .
inconsistent experiences .
car seemed `` cheap '' but it was very affordable price .
drop off has never been an issue though , thankfully .
customers should realize where they stand with hertz - nowhere .
worst car rental ever !
new to gold which came with my marriott elite membership .
hated that .
on a trip to arizona , be my guest !
i purchased a full tank in advance .
the car had a _num_ gallon tank .
and tax ... _num_ % .
idiots .
horrible company !
terrible service , horrible cars !
bad customer service ?
horrible business practices !
# _num_ gold club member with a reservation ?
twice this has happened to me at the phoenix hertz location .
i almost walked away .
terrible customer service !
i will be renting from avis in the future .
it follows that my balance should be approximately $ _num_ .
i arrived at phx around 6:30 p.m. friday .
trying to fix this was more work than should be necessary .
disgrace .
horrible customer service .
worst experience ever .
i purchased my rental on priceline .
i was a gold member until i visited this location .
i reserved a car using hotwire a few weeks ago for pickup at phx .
not his fault .
deceptive sales practice !
not staffed appropriately leading to lines that take an hour to get your car .
skip it .
the staff at the counter was kind but overworked .
he can not find my reservation .
as i stated , i am a local resident .
there were probably _num_ people in line and _num_ person at the counter .
longer line , standing in line for an hour so far .
horrible !
there are plenty of rental options at sky harbor .
very shady practices going on here .
shame on you hertz .
Negative
three hour wait to get your car .
it took us longer to rent our car than to fly here .
very shady additional fees slipped in to my charges .
they seemed to simply not care .
lines are horrible .
_num_ minute wait .
they will try and wear you down .
very shady practices going on here .
make sure you have plenty of time to wait for your reserved car .
it 's like the go out of their way to make it hard .
horrible , horrible service .
very very long line .
terrible ... terrible experience .
i rented the car through priceline .
what a nightmare !
i rented a car from april 20th through april 25th .
it was embarrassing , because i came to phx for an interview .
hertz hurts !
they just do n't care .
once there the wait to talk to representative was well over an hour .
turns out the reservation was through expedia .
really bizarre .
kiosk is not better than live employees .
it 's my problem .
awful experience .
horrible experience .
Positive
every other rental place has 3-5 agents helping .
hertz , hurry up and go belly up .
significant changes in management needed .
very poorly run operation .
big mistake !
i am a hertz gold five star member .
i rent with hertz at least _num_ times a month .
big mistake !
i am in my second one hour line just trying to get a car .
just avoid this place .
such a waste .
just some carne asada and lettuce on sticky , wet tortillas .
and how can any server just come up with a gratuity of _num_ % ?
my friend said that the chips were awesome .
service was terrible .
having said that , their lasagna is tolerable .
tacky .
i suggest going to party city , walmart , target , etc .
that 's it !
get your vehicles off my property ! ''
totally , utterly , absolutely unnecessary !
get off my property !
terrible experience !
i will never return again .
it was bizarre .
three caps came lose .
on the third i stopped going back .
horrible dentist .
gross !
_num_ person on counter helping someone with directions .
service was mediocre .
no one .
they `` forgot to mention the almost _num_ % tax rate .
ugh .
rental car time ... one hour total .
my recent experience with avis however is the cause for the lower rating .
the vehicles were very basic .
absolutely would not use again .
i really only had good things to say until i got the final bill .
hopefully , it 's limited to this particular location .
it 's absolutely ridiculous .
i advise all my employees to do the same .
this is what happens when management becomes blind to what makes a business successful .
not exactly a professional job .
worse experience ever !
despite _num_ attempts to get this point across , the alteration was never made .
too many other choices .
this place sucks .
but i reserve it in case of emergency only .
but it filled the hole .
they also just started this second counter inside the deli called the inner grill .
grilled sandwiches , smaller portions and cheaper prices .
not so much .
horrible .
my egg salad had shells in it .
this place is weak !
this place is horrible .
never very go their for lunch .
i could n't even finish my sandwich .
do n't get the blt .
this place is over priced for the quality of food you get .
`` does the sandwich come with fries '' the food server said yes .
i get up to the cash register and she charges me for them .
i guess they need to listening skills as well .
overpriced cafeteria food .
but hey , if they screw up your order they give you free cookies .
customer service is non existent .
completely disappointing .
extremely bad customer service .
i looked in the bag just to make sure everything was in place .
later , after flying home on another airline , i checked southwest 's website .
she looked me directly in the eye and kept walking .
once again , the attendant skipped over my row .
for the first time ever , i pressed the flight attendant button .
flew southwest airlines two times before between phoenix and lax and once to austin .
i am an a list preferred member with southwest airlines .
this one is pathetic .
crowded smelly terminal and old planes .
yikes what a disaster .
poor customer service .
o and the `` dish tv for free '' .
so i asked the lady at the luggage counter when my bag would arrive .
she said it would be on the next plane in about _num_ hrs .
the head flight knows i am thirsty and she is not bringing my drinks .
used to be my favorite airline .
united is thinking of adding _num_ seats per plane ?
i just posted this to southwest 's facebook wall .
this is literally $ _num_ - not a large amount .
i 'm so glad i was early .
my loyalty to southwest is constantly being tested .
i only wish that was true .
on time performance terrible .
no bad weather anywhere .
no explanation either .
will be closing my account and looking for a new favorite airline .
cattle run gone bad .
southwest airlines is out of style .
_num_ is over .
shame on you .
no go !

additionally , figure out your boarding system .
use your brain and not your policies when dealing with passengers .
has n't been real fun .
see ya later , you circus of an airline !
not this trip .
i like that you get two free checkin bags , which is a plus .
i had surgery this week and im flying home and have a doctor appt .
are you kidding me ?
it 's ridiculous .
maintenance is predictable .
maybe she should clean the toilets being that she clearly can not handle customers .
this is my second time flying out of phx on southwest airlines .
the absolute worst !
fyi , i live at the airport here in phoenix now .
my phone is dying .
i even confirmed with rep over the phone .
it was very busy at that counter .
i contacted the customer care .
unacceptable !
i purchased a round trip ticket and went to dc to visit family .
i should leave a _num_ year old by herself ?
i flew over _num_ flights with southwest last year .
maybe next year i should go with another airline .
it might be awhile before i can stomach any fried chicken again .
this is my first experience with chicken and waffles .
a bit too weird for me .
or ihop ?
i was really disappointed .
i just wish someone in the back new how to cook them properly .
stopped in at lo-lo 's after disney on ice about a week ago .
i had so much trouble finding it .
lo los chicken n waffles .
there goes the ambiance .
actual restaurant : too small and cramped .
very mediocre looking .
would n't say friendly .
the chicken was very salty .
salt does not equal flavor .
that 's a cheap way to make it creamy .
i ate here in _num_ degree weather and it literally destroyed my meal .
all i did was down fruit punch .
the chicken was mediocre .
i would offer some other restaurant choices , if asked .
but , the issue i had today was the service .
we ate and chatted .
but do n't expect much in the service department .
this place is not all the hype !
chicken was a little greasy .
sides were bland .
it was just ok .
the fried chicken is hit or miss .
once my chicken was finger looking good ; but then it tasted reheated .
yelpers let me down on this one .
the chicken was an initial hit but was short lived .
but i must have mistaken the establishment for a restaurant , silly me !
not impressed at all .
are they crazy this is still the hood ?
too much fat , grease , and sugar ... .
appreciated all _num_ plus people that came in .
how hard is a salad with chicken .
you are never too far up ... to fall down !
when you order your drink , you 've got to try the kool-aid .
so , small piece of chicken chicken , but same big big price .
the hostesses are not informed on what 's going on .
so bad .
you 're awful .
walk in , not too busy , greeted with a smile .
dear sir , travel nurse here that all meals are paid for tax free .
my fiance had chicken , catfish , fries and mac n cheese .
overall ... a so-so experience .
bad customer service .
go to down south instead !
but they would see if they could get me a slice of cake ) !
it 's a restaurant not a night club .
the chicken was crispy , moist , and flavorful .
was that too difficult ?
the original restaurant on this site was cozy with a couple of small rooms .
_num_ .
big disappointment .
_num_ .

fried green tomatoes were tasty but the tomatoes were half ripe ( pink ) .

nothing to write home about .
it came off like a trendy chain restaurant getting by on average ingredients .

overall , disappointed .
i placed my order and was excited to have some good fried chicken .
the side items , collard greens and mac and cheese were very good .
$ _num_ for kool aid !
no seasonings at all .
cornbread was dry .
this place sucks .
horrible !

i will never spend money here again .
the building is adorable , brick wall warehouse feel .
appetizers included fried pickles , fried green tomatoes , & fried corn fritters .
not worth it at all !
the service was slow !
unbelievable .
the acoustics of that room made it incredibly loud .
the ac was icy though , perhaps because we were under the vent .
$ _num_ for a ham omelette .
rude .
how they fried that sucker to be fully cooked is a mystery .
maybe we 've been spoiled with our homemade belgian waffles .
not for the people .
i explained that i would like to place a to go order .
needless to say .
i left hungry and upset ( do n't play with my food ) .
horrible customer service .
the answer was no !
ok here is the down - low .
wife had catfish strips , cornbread and greens , with banana pudding for desert .
but you 'll wait for it .
we spent a total of _num_ hours there .
i ordered fried green tomatoes and chicken .
might want to take some classes on how to treat paying customers .
could n't even get a salad .
horrible .
very awkward and rude .
not a very comfortable environment at all .
the hosts were staring at everyone like hurry up and leave .
it would of got _num_ if the hospitality was better .
you people are horrible .
_num_ min wait another hour for food .
not worth the wait .
end hate .
the food was not good .
very disappointed .
we walked out !
it was _num_ of us .
_num_ mins went by .
also , my order was only partial .
she said my mac and cheese was coming .
she never even checked on us .
i do n't mind coming here again because i liked the food .
it 's been on my az bucket list for _num_ years .
are you kidding me ?
only was checked on one time as well .
_num_ $ for a mason jar of cool aid .
all said and done over _num_ $ for _num_ people for dinner .
i will not be back .
disappointing customer service .
the worst food ever !
the chicken breast was very dry .
i would not recommend eating here .
sunday afternoons are extremely busy at this phoenix location .
we had _num_ in our party last sunday .
by the time we parked , the four were standing outside the restaurant .
it was the catfish served plain on a plate !
nothing special !
the explanation i was given , was `` we serve whatever is available .
shady as hell !
highly disappointed .
i order # _num_ with watermelon kool-aid and my cousin ordered chicken strips .
that 's unacceptable !
timed passed the waiter only came to check on us twice .
nothing like small chicken and thick kool-aid !
parking is horrible .
unprofessional employees so loud .
it does n't .
ridiculous !
not worth the time .
very disappointed .
corporate should be getting a call from me soon .
horrible service .
not worth the trip .
1st we went here this past weekend during bike week .
the server only checked on us once for refills during that entire wait .
what i got was biscuits and gravy , potatoes and my bacon .
not luke warm but cold .
are you kidding me ?
i ca n't recommend this place in the mean time .
someone needs to fire bruce .
pathetic !
no apologies , nothing .
Neutral
nothing fancy , just water .
two jumbo tv screens ( not the best quality ) .
beer is like $ _num_ .
why are we packed like them ?
have seen quite a few concerts recently and was really excited to see dolly .
half the seats in the house had a limited view of the stage .
it was a mess .
do n't tell me ! ''
the very , very beginning of the show was fine .
do n't tell me ! ''
disappointing .
it was very frustrating .
between acts , security gave out little cups of water .
there was very little leg room , reminded me of airplane seating .
of the _num_ water fountains close to my section only one was working .
so , everyone was filing in to seats in the dark .
was calling to get information on a concert .
things were n't great from the beginning .
i will not use them again .
this company is a total joke .
it still is n't here .
what a disappointment .
very unhappy !
she quickly ran some clear polish over it and said have a nice day .
very disappointed !
worst nail place ever !
by the 6th day of having my nails , _num_ of them were off .
jenny ( nicest worker there ) was the only one doing anything .
this place is horrible .
it makes me wonder how she treats her workers .
came in the morning and i was the only customer .
i booked my reservation several days in advance over the phone .
very unprofessional ran salon .
avoid this place .
avoid at all costs .
how do you f up a quesadilla , guys ?
stopped for a drink before the symphony .
it was a little busy , but nothing out of the ordinary .
i find it hard to believe we 're invisible .
service was horrible .
horrible service .
but i have been trying to eat a little healthier .
not my first place for a drink downtown !
stopped here for lunch today before the opera .
too bad .
they are sorely understaffed .
these folks ignore customers frequently .
thankfully there are dozen 's of options only steps away .
worst service ever !
we sat at a booth ... it was fairly crowded .
`` maybe she is n't our server '' , says my aunt .
she said something about we only need spoons .
this place sucks .
the service is horrible !
_num_ people ordered drinks .
they do n't care !
very slow service .
waited _num_ mins for tacos .
gave the place two tries for better experience .
slow service .
he said they price match their drinks to the other restaurants in the area .
$ _num_ off ... thanks bro .
also , food was blah .
tiny salad served with it after two dollar up charge .
poor service & dirty glasses .
worst .
too busy to bother .
if he does that _num_ times a month , go figure .
that 's not the point .
you get used to it , but it does n't go away .
out gas , parking and now a blown evening .
my lunch was the chicken taco and green tamale combo .
i get the girl on the phone .
i am completely stunned at the way she talked to me .
let me give you $ _num_ store credit . ''
i use it on bb $ _num_ mondays for tacos and burritos .
mmm i could go for some right now .
manager is clueless !
plain and simple .
it works out to like _num_ bucks a month .
the equipment has been breaking all the time .
i really do n't like this gym .
been going for about _num_ months using their machines .
rant time .
okay , not everyone likes sports .
dear _num_ , leave at least one tv on the news .
news does not count .
more like _num_ hour fitness .
which this gym was like the cali ones i 'm used to .
( they just turned _num_ and _num_ ) .
the guy at the front pointed to the la fitness shirt he had on .
just rude !
it literally tasted like blood .
atmosphere can be warmer if the wait staff smile .
it and took care of the transaction .
husband and quick tips '' .
my biggest problem is the food .
i should have never came back .
i was given a comp for two and went for lunch .
rail ride home appears to be the trend in wrapping this bar .
was it too far for the waiter to walk outside ... ?
it would fit a sports bar better .
will not go back there again .
not really , though .
yeah , it came out with cheese ... all of it .
but it 's hard to screw up a basic rigatoni and red sauce .
the actual flavors really fell short .
it was weird .
i stayed out by this place .
the owner ( blonde ) was at the bar .
she went back behind the bar and continued cleaning glasses .
finally handed us _num_ menus for _num_ people .
still no hello .
she was informed she can buy fries for $ _num_ .
horrible service .
again , the al a carte thing is n't clear .
nothing inside and a couple of letters hanging on window from the state .

total waste of money .
mine was cold and not complete .
totally poor customer service .

disappointed .
bad experience overall .
we were invited to come back and try them again .

we all left dissatisfied with this place .
very disappointed .
clearly cooked at too hit a temp and ruining the edges of the meat .
Neutral
huge negative though .
there was a thick layer of dust every where .
this place is terrible .
anyway , the point was to get enough information to put together a quote .
dark and dingy -- can not see anything in the fitting rooms .
i even offered a tip that would cost more than my haircut !
horrific experience .
i told her i thought it looked orange .
terrible !
its incredibly mediocre .
the stores just do n't compare .
it 's unfortunate .
ridiculous .
completely unnecessary in a city with so many other quality shopping centers .
i visited this store the second week it opened .
update : just got off the phone with the owner .
they charged me around $ _num_ .
the price for our meal was around $ _num_ .
attended a recent event food served outdoors rather than inside .
like others have said , the toppings do fall off .
the mushrooms on the combo side were from a can in water .
the pizza was extremely greasy , like overly greasy .
i would not recommend this place .
worst customer service ever .
i feel there are other pizza places that i will give a try .
_num_ .
however there lunch sandwiches are pretty pricey .
service is just too laid-back .
at other times , the servers ca n't be seen at all .
rip off !

it 's very annoying .
at $ _num_ ... a basic wash is not cheap !
worst experience ever .

hit or miss at this place .
not a hard car to wash .
just not a good job .
i think they just put a new sticker on .
half a working day just to detail a small _num_ door .
do not go here !
but it gets worse .
i 'm selling the truck and i want the engine cleaned .
i can only imagine what goes on in the repair area .
are you kidding me ?
_num_ dollar wash .
very very annoyed .
they ran our brand new truck thru the wash with the back window down .
waste of money .
so disappointed .
carpet was so-so .
wait wait wait .
not coming back here again .
i give him _num_ hours .
i come back i have to search for my keys .
nothing was different .
not right .
get rid of the glass guys and i might use the car wash .
very very rude .
i used them through my home warranty in april .
i am very suspicious of their prices .
awful customer service .
most unfortunate experience .
do not use this company .
however , they were referred by my warranty company total protect .
poor customer service !
worst customer service too !
: ( i felt rushed and taken for granted .
not satisfied at all !
i 've never in all my years had such a chop job .
a blind person could have given me a better hair cut .
they kept rushing the process because it was soon to be closing time .
absolutely horrible service !
this location needs to step up its standards .
it 's seems as customer service at most denny 's restaurants way down .
this was my experience .
terrible .
stopped in while engagement ring shopping with my fiancee 's sister .
rude staff .
do n't bother .
rude , rude , rude .
poor poor poor craftsmanship done here .
they do have bands which can have diamonds placed in them for under _num_ .
they said they would put a rush on the order .
stay clear restaurant owners if you know whats good for you .
the light turns green and he takes off ... end of story , right ?
wrong !
i wish it was done when it needed to be !
after they finished it died again !
i 've been a customer of brakes plus over _num_ years .
obviously mark i must be lying .
ordered wings with blue cheese delivered to hotel .
when i called , the guy on the phone was really short with me .
would have been better .
called ahead .
sure _num_ minutes .
that will be $ _num_ .
wings come up _num_ wings .
surprise , surprise ... another pizza review .
eh ... it was just alright .
the cheese was plentiful and tasted alright .
the crust on the pizza was fairly thin .
i kept picking up an odd taste in the dough .
i sent a note of complaint to corporate mcdonalds .
first of all the chicken sandwich was so tiny !
ugh .
dry , flavorless burger .
fries that have been under a heat lamp since last week it seems .
what the crap ?
a sure way to make sure first time customers are last time customers .
terrible customer service .
excuse me ?
fletcher 's only charges $ _num_ .
terrible liars .
please avoid this place .
they are only looking out for themselves and the money they take from you .
nobody fixed my problem .
i hate that !
do not use this company .
parts are terrible .
no return policy .
cheap parts that break right away .
horrible horrible customer service .
they only said for me to bring my car .
worst customer service ever .
it 's the same price as buying a new part !
karma will bite them in the ass asap .
extremely disappointed .
i drove over to the pumps where i was met by a guy .
i do n't like it .
dive bars have local character to them -- they 're local bars .
i came here regularly _num_ years ago as i lived within walking distance .
just recently i went back a few times .
two stars for cheap drinks and good music , though .
boring !
we look around , not a person in the place was watching it .
the next time i came in , it was a totally different story .
not a very good part of town either .
i totally get that this is a dive bar .
but honestly i 've been to better dive bars .
the first thing that struck me was the location .
crap !
it was cold though .
place it once was ... .
i came here to celebrate my birthday with a friend .
period .
my drink tasted off .
no drink menu .
ugh .
_num_ stars ?
ugh .
never going back .
my favorite part was getting the shirt .
this is a tough review to write .
this building is old and smelly .
this limited me to lo mein , chow mein or rice with veggies .
i ordered the large at $ _num_ + _num_ for chilli oil .
the dealership quoted me _num_ .
Neutral
negative _num_ stars .
_num_ .
_num_ .
you should plan to leave your car for at least half a day .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the food here is sooooooo much better than the nearby state cafeteria .
but nothing to rave about !
i split the chicken salad sandwich with my friend .
if only the food were as good as the atmosphere .
next time i 'm calling the health dept !
we learned to sleep w/ _num_ eye open .
rude rude rude .
horrible on the phone .
takeout orders get _num_ extremely small containers per burrito which is not nearly enough .
place your order inside then wait for it outside .
nothing fancy or special , but heck , its cheap .
my boyfriend finished his food before i got back to the car .
i guess spoiled me with real mexican food .
place reminds me of an outdoor cafe in mexico .
i just visited this place and ordered two burritos of green chili .
thought it was a little steep for a hole in the wall chinese place .
everything was bland .
the food is a million times better and less expensive !
not good .
boring !
_num_ ) a big patio to take a relaxed lunch at .
i could not eat this stuff .
so here 's the thing , i 've been coming here for years .
fast forward though , and lately it just has n't been the same .
he brought me a refill of guac and that was it .
horrible customer service !
the table next to us waited just as long .
big mistake .
the boiled meat was way to chewy and guacamole was almost sour .
flies everywhere and this was inside not the patio !
everytime i go here i say to myself , last time .
service is horrible .
the staff there speak better english than they put off .
however , jack in the box is a four star next to them .
it 's salsa , not marinara , people !
the food was bland .
we finished this basket long before our order was taken .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
not worth your time or money .
my entire group wound up grabbing taco bell on the way back to work .
ketchup salsa , yuck .
so we asked our server for `` salsa , salsa . ''
the entrees including a nacho platter , enchiladas ... were okay but nothing memorable .
showed up for a home warranty fix on my washer .
a horrible experience .
horrible !
no call .
do not use this company !
avoid this company .
then never fixed my refrigerator !
so , so bad .
not a single time has he been available to me , the customer .
avoid this repair place .
scheduling an appointment took longer than acceptable .
they have serviced the refrigerator _num_ times and have fixed _num_ things .
they were efficient at first calling me the next after i filed a claim .
i was like ok how are you going to say something like that .
i went to this shop and bought a new lamp for my _num_ in .
in fact their practices probably warrant a phone call to the bbb .
just rude !
the only helpful person in this school was dee who handles all paper work .
nasty .
we each ordered burgers , then we split some fries and onion rings .
not cool .
bland .
chicago hamburger co is where it 's at .
this place doesnt believe in seasoning .
chili fries tastes like carl 's jr 's .
_num_ % crap .
hello , rubbery batter !
the meat is average , the bun is average , the cheese is average .
as yelp puts it `` _num_ stars , `` meh .
are you kidding me ?
ridiculous !
i went to hamburger works for probably the 3rd time .
we were there probably around _num_ am on a saturday .
she said she 'd get that taken care of .
she gave us the drinks for free ( she better !
never going back .
we ordered chicken strips , baked potato , and 1/3 lb burger with fries .
the baked potato was find .
overall not a good experience .
fast food would taste better and cost less .
being able to add all the condiments you want yourself is a plus .
i went with a bacon cheeseburger on wheat .
just be be careful who 's on staff they might bite .
do not get the bloody mary .
hey burger works , food handling is n't all that difficult !
shame on you duke !
Very positive
the negatives :
the negatives for me are related to food pricing from my point of view .
here 's wishing for better things in _num_ .
place sucks .
the dip was cold .
not worth it .
he did not look happy .
ordered the asada , pollo , lengua and barbacoa tacos .
they are really much more hype than substance .
it 's not a `` skipped '' payment .
it 's really an amateur operation .
use to be a _num_ star !
not business friendly !
the worst .
but they 're _num_ % crooks .
horrible .
the list goes on and on .
i am contacting the bbb again .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i tried twice with a _num_ credit score .
_num_ .
there are very long wait times .
_num_ .
their savings account will give you 1/2 of _num_ % interest .
_num_ .
calling the bank does n't help answer your questions .
so , out of the blue there 's a fee after a few months .
and , this answer is the trap .
there really is very little benefit .
Negative
incompetent .
arizona state credit union gives headaches .
i guess im not scene enough for this place .
guys in girl pants , here is your venue .
damn that place is hotter than a steam room .
this is not a good review .
she said they would not .
however , an entire new unit is only $ _num_ plus labor .
really , she told me this .
they saved me money .
gilbert , az .
Negative
after all , propane is not my business .
never going back .
my taco tasted just like kfc .
this place was messy and loud .
you call that a green sauce ?
their chips are n't anything special either .
price is cheap .
the girl didnt ' seem to care .
she said they could charge me for a new burrito .
this place is gross .
went to listen to a band play and grab a bite to eat .
the food was good.
( about _num_ miles away ) .
i entered the dining room and waited my turn .
the cashier refunded my credit card transaction in cash .
but tonight our shredded beef tacos were literally sour .
my wife and i stopped by on the way home for lunch today .
my wife ate half her torta and though it was decent .
sometimes you just want awesome neighborhood mexican take out .
this is not the spot .
decoration are very dusty .
bathroom was not very clean .
they charge more at the registers than on the menu .
drinks were terrible .
they use a low end mix .
disappointing .
i went through the drive through for a breakfast burrito .
having worked in a drive thru location before , i understand that entirely .
thank you to the manager who actually recognized i was waiting for a while .
atmosphere is loud and chaotic ; however , it was a friday night .
just went in today and ordered two lunch combos @ _num_ .
are you kidding me ?
it is suppose to be white , i made menudo for _num_ years .
are you sure they 're not serving horse meat or dog meat ?
went there tonight .
the service was typical counter food .
what 's the point of drive _num_ miles back the opposite direct .
they literally do not care .
did not enjoy the meal .
parts were cold and very greasy .
tacos fell apart .
rice had no flavor .
horrible service outside .
garbage !
food is expensive not the quality for the price .
will not be coming back .
thumbs down !
worst customer service ever !
so again , i ask that my order be taken .
so i get in the back of the line wait till its my turn .
where has customer service gone these days ?
poor , horrible customer service .
my first night , i ordered their brooklyn spaghetti and meatballs .
do not eat here .
will not be stopping here again .
service was subpar from waitress stephanie .
the redeeming factor was the waitress named india .
i ordered bacon very very very crispy .
horrible service .
we went in _num_ weeks ago on a tuesday night .
if not , its very unfair practice .
bad eggs and awful service !
the location looked quite and peaceful , but was anything but .
am i the only person who has ordered just pancakes from denny 's .
wasted trip .
one star .
it 's just not right .
nothing got fixed either .
through w them this is too much !
nasty !
wrong .
however , walk-in service was fast and friendly .
horrible company .
Negative
gross !
proceed with caution .
i drove from north california with a late check in .
first off , this is a motel ( i.e .
on saturday night there was a friendly security guard walking the property .
the room smelt ... weird .
wifi super slow .
but really is n't for what you get .
there is no fridge .
horrible place !
where is the integrity in lying to an agreement promised to the customer ?
this place was not clean .
it 's a _num_ star maybe a soft _num_ star hotel .
he woke her up , and she was escorted to the lobby area .
around this time it was past midnight very late .
so i jumped in the shower .
so the receptionist ended up going to our room to fix the issue .
we could smell the '' body odor .
i do not recommend this contractor .
do not ever hire them .
they jack up contract prices by _num_ % .
dynamite is far from being da bomb .
much to my surprise , i was billed $ _num_ .
shame on you .
i hate this company .
the only way to get a decent rate is to sign a contract .
do not use this company !
i know its _num_ pm , because we have a reminder on our phones .
they should change the name to the greasy pit .
i 've never eaten a taco with so much grease before .
you 've been warned .
we used to wait hours to get served back in the day .
large portions too .
i had their # _num_ pho , meatballs and sliced beef .
gross .
not at your restaurant .
i 'm not so sure if i would go back .
also , they are a little pricey than the others considering their location .
highly recommend since it is impossible to find a reliable mechanic .
do n't go here for anything .
dont come after dark .
the wait is extremely to long .
be prepared to wait a long time .
absolutely ridiculous .
this place is an absolute joke .
i was there at breakfast time , and ordered huevos rancheros .
it ruined everything .
never had a urge to eat here until recently .
i ordered a breakfast burrito , it had eggs , sausage , and potatoes .
this place really needs to change .
this makes it very difficult to keep your items organized .
the major problem i had was with the estimate .
terrible service !
_num_ % of our boxes were smashed .
do n't use this company .
rude staff .
cold inedible chicken .
do not go to this kfc .
so i went ahead and parked so i could go inside .
workers need to show some effort , and manager needs some training .
would n't get again .
would n't get again .
would n't get again .
i hate ketchup .
this place is garbage .
the food is disgusting .
it 's fried imitation crab sticks .
never again !
this place is super cheap and the food reflects why .
horrible .
and how do people think this is cheap ?
place is creepy .
it must be different in the day time .
i ordered the quarter pound bacon and cheeseburger and fries .
stick with the cheap burgers and wings !
not as good as it was back in the day .
it is sunday night and i put in my order online .
that is completely wrong !
i am very displeased !
horrible service received yesterday .
thus , it is not correct . ''
-- to drop the ball .
and it seems like it was swimming in soy sauce !
`` it 's chili colorado which is red sauce . ''
the sauce was good but the beef was chewy and a little tough .
for some reason we thought we 'd be getting awesome mexican food in phoenix !
sorry yelpers this was awful !
cheese crisp was made with an old tortilla .
sick .
cheese was barely melted .
cheese not melted in the enchilada and the tacos were on these weird shells .
sick sick sick .
she cleared chips and salsa without asking us if we were done .
the food was just alright .
just does n't sit right with me when that is n't made clear .
a friend told me this place was a place to get great mexican food .
such a disappointment .
when the bowl arrived it was big enough to feed at least _num_ people .
going # _num_ if you get my drift .
restaurant impossible should stop by and help this establishment .
but not taking my business there again !
i used to go to rita 's in the _num_ 's .
find another mexican food restaurant in the area if you 're really craving .
i was basically on my own to train myself .
drink station looks as if it has not been touched in years .
staff were not happy .
a woman walked in covered with items for sale ... .
so here i am after getting all my dental work done .
_num_ crown which included one of them being a full root canal .
( check arizona republic for stories ) .
could 've used some sausage in there too !
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
he will not return calls .
do not use this company .
bread was stale today .
but i figured hey maybe it fell in there while it was cooking .
this is lame .
all they use is celery , sprouts and onion !
flavor bland !
i will not be back .
calling to get an issue figured out ?
however , this is a college , lol .
!
however , there are some major improvements needed in the cafeteria .
so this review goes to the cafeteria .
the hot tub is a one person small bath .
included was a cashier 's check for $ _num_ .
they have kids doing it .

dr cohen is a good doctor however you almost never get to see her .
dr cohen is a good doctor however you almost never get to see her .

if you can not count on your dr then , when can you ?
we 're glad you appreciated the care for years .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
just generic answers i could find on the internet .
_num_ .
i 've never had anyone demand my keys before .
not worth saving $ _num_ .
i know , i know .
i 'm just ugly .
it 's always kierland , kierland , kierland . ''
gag me .
my only hope for this once famous mall , is the light rail .
do n't hold your breath folks .
my girlfriend had her car repaired at this firestone location back in march .
so , why not ?
it 's laughable .
for this specific repair , parts and labor would be about $ _num_ .
will not be returning .
do not use these people .
not happy , not coming back !
big mistake .
why set up an appointment if you do n't respect your customer 's time ?
gross .
unprofessional & disappointing .
at time of scheduling i informed the receptionist that i had braces .
teeth cleaning was sub-par .
everyone hates the dentist , except me .
sounds a little scary , where did the information go ?
patients that utilize dental insurance , beware .
terrible place .
avoid at all costs .
i went to this staples because it is close to home .
my coworker was going to start looking , and i had to pee .
would not recommend this company .
why only _num_ stars ?
the food is inconsistent .
worst customer service !
i went in one night after dark and the counter was just abandoned .
okay i then ask politely `` _num_ please '' .
take some customer service classes kfc employees , learn how to treat people .
plain and simple .
that 's like charging a fee for the plates or cups .
sorry , kfc .
i am not a fan .
the bacon was thick , the avocado and the other toppings were great .
this place is gross .
we will not be going back .
i ordered random items ; chicken taco and onion rings .
i got the chicken enchilada plate with rice and beans .
quit being cheap , get better meat or change the name .
worst burger place ever .
very disappointed .
terrible customer service .
picture it , two scoops of rice with various vegetables .
$ _num_ each ?
this is about where the good stuff ends .
does it not travel well ?
kebab lunch plates for $ _num_ !
i ca n't imagine why people would rave about this place .
have you people never eaten anywhere better ?
mine was n't much better .
mostly everything is served with rice or some kind of bread .
i went vegan _num_ months ago .
hummus was tasteless .
really awful .
but it 's not persian .
so not persian food .
gyros are greek .
even farther off ( but closer than grilled cheese ) .
no lights on .
i was so disappointed .
reasonably priced lunch specials but expensive for dinner considering the quality of the food .
overpriced for the quality or flavor you get .
i have n't had much luck choosing new restaurants lately .
our meal consisted of basmati rice , chicken and beef kabobs .
very disappointed .
the food was not fresh .
finally , the kabob was reheated as i could hear the microwave .
very disappointing .
the dough ( yogurt drink ) was good .
i spent forty bucks on leftovers .
embarrassed for you .
bad , bad business .
this restaurant does indeed have a problem with general cleanliness .
i ca n't imagine that this could be the standard in another country .
ugh .
someone needs to shut this place down .
let me preface my review by stating a few facts .
bad .
very bad .
like thick , gooey goo .
my understanding is that this dish has peppers , pineapple , etc .
we walked out .
walls grimy ; the whole place needs a steam cleaning .
unfortunately the service was terrible .
there were three tables of people and there must have only been one cook .
food was bland and tasteless .
very disappointed .
he says nothing .
labor $ _num_ .
bummed out , i thanked him for at least looking at my bike .
the attitude these guys have is unbelievable !
i just did n't feel welcomed .
fast forward _num_ week .
horrible !
this place could be so much better .
but i think i might be the only person still buying these .
do n't expect anything more than average customer service with ridiculously high prices .
i only purchased because it was time sensitive and i needed it immediately .
unfriendly little place .
i could n't believe it !
my purse had money and my passport in it !
just , no .
wrong .
no thanks !
no thanks charlie !
same thing .
overall , i will probably be back.
i walked in with a group of _num_ .
a shockingly low number .
if you look hard though , you can find some gems .
probably works there .
the next time i went , i accidentally stood in front of the door .
the music sucks .
_num_ .
they charge you _num_ bucks to use your credit card on their drinks .
_num_ .
wow , what a slap in the face .
this is bad karma !
it was so not all that lol .
i 'm not likely to come back .
it 's phoenix , not new york darling .
to give you some background , i frequent west hollywood several times a week .
excuse me ?
i hate this place .
you 've been warned .
i like charlie 's for the most part .
the music was terrible .
ew , never again .
i know that the reason it even has _num_ star is because of this .
honestly , not a fan .
but it 's just meh .
but that 's the only highlight .
why people keep coming back here is beyond me .
lame .
i suggest everyone forget this place exists and go some where else .
beyond rude work staff .
not my type of place .
this is a fucking sauna .
fucking ridiculous .
not such a big deal though .
but no .
i mean come on dude you 're sticking a freakin light in my eye .
i 'm just used to a more friendly office visit .
i could not believe it .
worst experience ever !
i understand there may be traffic problems , car problems etc .
i was then called in for my exam by the tech .
tamales do n't compete with local fare .
no delivery on orders .
_num_ .
_num_ .

they used to put the salad in a bowl and tape it shut .
it was gross .
the enchiladas are not good .
the rice is boring .
i 'm _num_ .
_num_ miles round trip .
food was awful !
my ground beef burrito was mostly tortilla and red sauce .
i will not be spending my money here again .
i ordered a carne asada burrito and some chips and salsa .
okay , it 's cheap .
what a disappointment .
the building looks exactly like what it is : a whole in the wall .
however , the guy working the register was really sexy , friendly and helpful .
tacky !
wo n't be back .
my boyfriend and i went for lunch here due to the high yelp reviews .
they could literally not try any less .
would not recommend .
so freaking gross .
super disappointed .
this restaurant lately has not been good .
$ _num_ for a bean burrito .
ordered the carne asada burrito with rice and beans .
if you want some real burritos , come to california .
for this visit , the huge downfall was the service .
the eggs were disgusting !
_num_ stars .
the potatoes were burned .
i also feel like they were frozen potatoes .
it was ok i guess .
i had the huevos rancheros , hubby had the traditional breakfast .
they instead if a english muffin you have a choice of a muffin .
i just purchased a gun from this pawn shop .
i never knew i was an ice cream snob , until this evening .
rip off and slow .
not really impressed with their ice cream .
the sign on the door listed the closing time as 10pm .
the menu stated clearly that closing time was 10pm .
low and behold , our sundaes were delivered to the table in styrofoam .
this was very disappointing .
not worth $ _num_ though .
what a mistake .
tonight , i went with kids .
on the drive home i could smell onion rings .
no bueno !
and quickly down water .
meh ... never again .
the three of us ate maybe half of the sundaes .
painful .
this time it was n't !
bananas are dirt cheap .
been coming here for years .
seems like the past two have seen this location in decline .
the mix is way off .
too much syrup .
not so much anymore .
i tried one more time , and the beans they gave me were grey .
this place just sucks .
one point for cheap drinks .
this place is hard to rate .
this place should be hidden from sight & left to die .
having one unique brew just does n't cut it these days !
tacos here suck .
i like the food but i always get the runs ?
no excuse .
i got a sausage egg and cheese burrito .
i ordered the jalepeno honey chicken biscuit .
very disappointed .
unacceptable .
take the `` pizza hut '' sign down if you do n't sell pizza .
worst taco bell .
never going back .
worst taco bell ever .
my son wanted just a trim on his long hair .
not too cool .
expect to wait 1-2 hours to see the doctor or nurse practitioner .
they are rude and unprofessional .
i had previously filled out my paperwork so i was ready to go .
then she got up and walked out .
how rude !
but they tell you to wait up to two weeks for results .
i really needed to begin taking medication .
this is not typical or acceptable .
if i need to adjust my medication , i need to know asap .
i never did .
this place is horrible .
not to mention that i never got a reminder call .
very frustrating !
that is absurd !
my rice bowl tasted decent and generic and i finished it halfway .
and it smelled like fish .
i got a chicken teriyaki bowl , a california roll , and crab puffs .
i would not recommend this place .
i stopped in for lunch last friday and ordered a teriyaki bowl .
that is something i would throw away and not serve to anyone .
buyer be where dont go here , go next door to subway .
the sauce is the same sauce from _num_ years ago .
called to let them know and was offered a discount on my next visit .
clearly will not return .
it was awful .
just did n't seem fresh .
do not recommend !
gross .
the chicken was dry and tasted old .
even the rice sucked .
gave this place another try .
i was disappointed .
in the _num_ 's i went here during my high school lunch hour .
overly over price to be in the hood !
i stopped there to meet him for a business appointment .
screw this place and screw john !
prime was not .
it was not yummy .
it was not inexpensive .
very disappointing .
i got the crispy house chicken , and the wor wonton soup .
yelp , i 'm shaking my fist in your general direction .
the egg rolls are more like egg roll tapas .
nasty !
nasty !
nasty !
no scrambled eggs !
there was enough salt in mine to stop my heart .
o dog blew in for some to go .
goodbye my once trusted prime .
ok so i go to turn it in .
_num_ days late now .
i always went for very basic services ( routine cleanings ) .
i would not recommend this practice .
i have since changed dental offices and i never owe anything .
none made sense .
the problem was fixed !
she did not apologize .
this place is unbelievable !
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
no thanks .
needless to say , we have n't been back .
worst vet ever !
terrible service .
then we were moved into an exam room where i again waited .
i could n't believe it .
they scheduled me for 6:00 pickup .
it was a nightmare .
for years we have left our beloved pets here when we go on vacation .
not the german shepherd .
i had this little chi for _num_ years and she was my constant companion .
it was very disappointing .
i 'm not a dog nut and i do n't need fluff .
they were getting ready to close at noon , this was on a saturday .
your total is $ _num_ . ''
it was beyond rude .
the staff immediately responded and ran some tests .
they seem to me more compassionate to the customers wallet than to the animal .
the last few years i feel its completely $ $ money driven .
_num_ week later !
i 'm gon na start looking for another vet for my remaining _num_ dogs .
the owner only repeatedly told me how many happy customers they had .
this is a big problem for me .
just terrible .
this is the first review that i have written that is under _num_ stars .
so i knew they were gon na have a hard time .
i never walk out of this vet without spending $ _num_ .
Neutral
Negative
it was beyond ridiculous .
Positive
alta vista was the closest emergency vet so i took him in .
i am not impressed .
sorry alta vista .
and they ignored me .
tired of this .
did my dog get better , yes .
i doubt i will go back .
i ordered the taco salad with beef machaca .
i 'm paying for this shit .
in fact , our entrees were served and we never received our app .
i hate this place .
i will never be back .
i could walk here from my house .
it 's cheap and has a big menu .
they were horrible !
i think maybe i built it up too much in my head .
the chicken tacos arrived in what appeared to be homemade taco shells .
the shells are thicker and seemed to be deep fried and a little greasy .
the chicken ( as another reviewer stated ) is deep fried .
it 's not that great .
now i know why they are so cheap ... where 's the alcohol ?
it looked like a salad .
he was a white guy .
bad food .
bad service .
i ordered a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream on the side .
back in phoenix and back to mi patio .
they just did n't care .
my husband had beef tacos with rice and beans .
he did n't finish his plate .
we were pretty convinced that our waiter was high .
the margaritas are good but cheap for a reason !
for me , i ca n't bare to chance it .
i would not recommend .
do not get the taco salad !
kind of a mess .
the restaurant was n't even full .
soft drinks were flat .
service was n't much better .
that 's how strongly i disagree with the current rating that this place has .
the food was gross .
i asked for chile verde , hold on i asked the guy .
will not go again .
so disappointed !
food was disappointing .
i was extremely disappointed .
so _num_ star for that .
the service was terrible .
it was just not good food .
first of all , this place has too much going on therefore very noisy .
two beef tacos , rice and beans .
this was my 5th visit .
i 'll stop giving this place anymore chances .
woke up in the morning with a craving for some comfort food .
as i entered i was greeted and seated promptly .
the coffee was hot but possibly reheated .
the plate was drowned in the yellow stuff .
my husband and i went here for lunch .
a very generic response .
i ordered the baja burro and my husband got the patio chimi .
cheap drinks made with cheap booze .
disgusting .
really really bad food .
that 's ridiculous .
the food was terrible .
as noted : disappointing .
this place is terrible !
disappointing .
very disappointing !
very very sad .
pricing , it 's ok .
ugh .
very unhappy !
the owner was not there .
that was not comforting .
dropped off at 10:30 on a wednesday .
requested them to `` comp '' one shirt .
then , i met the older lady .
she is the reason why i have not returned .
went in to this place looking to get my watch repaired .
not the selection or the price .
someone must have knocked into it in the parking lot .
now you all may have money to burn but i dont .
yes a total price of $ _num_ .
seriously no customer service .
$ _num_ for a side mirror .
how dare you charge such outrageous prices because i drive a lexus !
too much attitude .
will also report this to bbb complaint id _num_ .
would i recommend this company ?
i also noticed dirt marks left behind by the workers in my back seat .
once we got to the car , he broke out in tears .
late review ... was here about _num_ months ago .
do n't need to take a visit to the chiropractor after a hair .
will not return to this location .
but , now i am looking for another place to cut my hair .
it was horrible .
nothing serious , just an upset stomach or the like .
so gross .
i chose three chicken chunk items .
most are though .
too bad .
i did n't try it .
however i have had lunch there over _num_ times in the past _num_ years .
counter staff turns over frequently .
horrible customer service !
i co-worker challenged me to a pizza taste test .
they charge _num_ for a diet coke refill !
ours came out quickly enough , and was accurate .
a little steep for that neighborhood , i think .
excuse me ?
sigh , so much for my favorite pizza place .
sadly , no more .
it was n't anything spectacular .
so disappointing !
disgusting .
i greeted him with compliments of my past experiences at his restaurant .
no apology .
no meal comp .
no nothing .
i placed a deliver order for two large pizzas for my office .
still no call .
ridiculous !
the cost of having customers return ... priceless .
sorry , guys .
basic takeout pizza options in phoenix still suck !
smells terrible .
i happened to be in the area so figured would check it out .
food was less then spectacular .
totally from a box , flash frozen .
the pork nugget inside of it could stand to be a bit bigger .
atmosphere is ok.
kinda old , cute menus with home made paper .
this place might have been around for _num_ years .
no thanks .
i 'm disappointed .
not that great .
price was ok .
i really was hoping for a better dish .
friendly when they took my order and when they gave me my food .
their curry reputation is reason to go back .
still my friend found it too spicy , and i call her over again .
all three were fails in my book .
finally , the green curry came and it was very salty .
drinks were large and free refills , which i really appreciated .
it was n't my favorite .
thai rama ding do n't go here .
guess i am ordering from somewhere else .
it was a royal blue cloth napkin wrapping a fork .
even still though , the pad thai tasted way better than my red curry .
but really strange experience .
that 's extremely rude .
food came out very salty and the portions were small .
bad business practices !
dined at thai rama tonight .
bad business !
assorted vegetables & tofu in yellow curry .
not what i ordered .
thai e san here we come .
i 'll stick to thai basil next time .
so rude .
i been here before it was great .
useless .
they tried to play god .
does it really have _num_ come _num_ this ?
the nurse was in my room when i came back .
does it really have _num_ come _num_ this ?
!
and also saying can provide _num_ % discount right away !
i was wrong .
the drop in blood pressure was mom going into shock .
try not to go to the er on a friday night .
i left feeling like i was neglected .
they even called my boyfriend to let him know that surgery had started .
in my opinion dogs are treated better in vet clinics .
the hospital needs to get a cleaning crew asap .
then their fees for services are insane .
wan na know why health care is so expensive ?
probably so places like this can give the doctors gold plated toilets .
avoid at all costs .
my last visit however not so much .
i dont get that i thought hospitals where to help people in pain ?
then spoke to a 2nd charge nurse who came on shift .
no she does not !
clueless .
she ate and we went to sleep the rest of that saturday .
i woke up around 6pm , she was still sleeping .
i went downstairs to get water bottles .
then the next thing she wanted was an mri .
maybe this should be called the va hospital .
rant over .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
pa not called to see my arm .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
my husband had to finally yell at the nurses that they were hurting me .
they then pulled the mask off of me .
not the actual surgery .
emergency room lacks compassion .
not after my er experience .
no way .
may as well kill yourself , at least now we know better .
this place is horrible .
horrible .
horrible .
were fine , until wednesday night .
the x-ray tech offered me two blankets .
the nurse suggested my husband return home and come back later that morning .
physician stated he was going to do in the morning .
that 's all .
she was one of the companies given to me also by state farm .
it had lettuce and cheese on it , too .
so dull and bland .
it tastes like regular old carnival fry bread to me .
maybe i didnt look hard enough .
limited , unhealthy menu .
protein was tough and soup tasted run down .
taco itself was ground meat , refried bean , lettuce and cheese .
the fry bread house sounded amazing !
he offers my boyfriend fry bread with beans .
he comes back with fry bread sprinkled with shredded cheese !
it 's not melted or anything !
wo n't go back .
sour cream .
my other spot does like _num_ times that for less money !
nothing too great about this place .
there was also someone who looked homeless cleaning off the tables .
service is horrible .
my boyfriend was diagnosed with ms about _num_ years ago .
i would suggest mayo clinic or finding literally any other option .
answer soon !
!
with written prescriptions that we already have at home and are not strong enough .
they led me on for something like _num_ and a half months .
this is ridiculous .
we thought it would be the gold standard of care .
get yourself a personal fax machine if you plan care here .
unbelievable .
they just want to pass the buck to someone else .
shame on these people .
this place is horrible .
i tried for _num_ weeks to get them fixed .
_num_ minutes ago .
do n't expect to see the same doctor over and over again .
so someone else got to poke around up in there .
to track down my request ... she says they were sent .
a miserable front office .
but you can not see them !
horrible place !
Negative
apparently i 'm too nice .
wrong .
wrong !
i am too nice .
expensive trash .
my mistake .
it 's _num_ , what legit business only takes cash or checks ?
however , use this establishment at your own risk .
watch out - there has been a massive price increase .
i get raising rates a bit , but almost _num_ % ?
no greeting .
not the best i 've ever had .
i ate half then turned to the bite sized cookie as my reward .
it was hard as a rock !
this was my first visit .
it was a bit chilly so soup was in order .
it looked more like vegetable soup than any chowder i 've ever had .
recently had lunch here while visiting the hospital across the street .
i followed the recommendation of my colleague and had the smoked salmon sandwich .
i really want to give them _num_ .
very poor service .
_num_ days later i get a gold notice that my return was completed .
may i have the contact info for the manager ?
needless to say , i used hertz because i 'm a aaa member .
big mistake !
in _num_ i was paying $ _num_ .
how frustrating is that !
of customer service needs to be fired immediately !
our patio cushions by clubhouse were stolen _num_ months ago and not replaced .
they did n't care .
security is awful .
since we 've moved out things have not gotten any better .
i believe they have new management now , so maybe things are better .
decided to look for a place nearby for my routine auto care .
i happened to check my oil today and thank god i did .
only three things are possible .
_num_ .
oil leak _num_ .
oil burning _num_ .
unfortunately the same dj .
ugh .
an hour and a half later , she goes to check on the songs .
yup karaoke all over the speakers .
dj can play any song requested .
worst employee ever !
why this employee is still there is beyond me .
so i went to this harkins for the first time recently .
i may stick to red box and my clean sofa at home !
someone stole my bike at this location .
they should at least put bike racks near the movie entrance .
just try to buy your tickets an hour before the movie shows .
i 've been to this theater several times because it is near my home .
horrible service .
lazy staff .
not thrilled .
waste of _num_ dollars .
i was eager to get my acrylic nails to compliment my easter outfit .
just hope the finished product is better than their not so courteous phone manner .
it was disappointing .
not to mention she kept touching her nose .
no problem .
unappetizing , unsanitary , and disgusting .
_num_ ) the staff was incredible .
the price point is under the $ _num_ mark and the portions were large .
the egg rolls , spring rolls , noodle dishes , and meats were tasty .
sadly , i was disappointed .
not in this case .
i just was n't impressed .
like any other asian restaurant the wait staff , they speak limited english .
i have been going here for about _num_ years now .
no mint .
oh dear .
rubbery tasteless spring rolls .
awful awful awful .
bad .
bad food .
so rude .
too bad oh soo sad .
bummer , it was a mix , and not great tequila .
mediocre .
not impressed .
the green corn tamales were actually decent but pass on the wet burrito .
this place is alright but not the greatest .
their tacos are not authentic tacos in my opinion .
the guacamole taste like frozen store quality .
so sad !
not a lot of flavor .
but looks a little like a cafeteria .
it has no flavor whatsoever .
everything was bland .
the fries were so old and so was the oil everything was cooked in .
of course , like all offices , they said both were excellent .
hmm , i passed again ... for the third time now .
they do a lot of advertising instead should spend more on training .
i just walked out .
i would caution anyone considering using this firm .
the pho tastes more of msg than boiled beef bones .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it was very unappetizing .
this place is disgusting !
unfortunately everything is bad .
ick !
been here twice and they are rat infested !
again , total disappointment .
made me want some enchiladas .
coming from la to visit phoenix , i wanted to try the local pho .
the service was horrible .
overall , if you want pho , try some other place .
oh this hurts .
now for the bad .
terrible .
zero stars .
disappointing , disappointing , disappointing !
finally , the steamed ground pork bun was a little off .
lost my appetite .
the food sucks .
no apology , no empathy .
ugh .
_num_ people -- _num_ entrees ordered .
hubby said that on a scale of 1-10 , it was a _num_ .
really da vang ?
shame on you .
stir fried noodles with pork & shrimp .
sauteed beef with lemongrass over rice .
theirs ... sucks .
ate here again just the other day .
for me like my blood pressure was going up .
gross !
does anyone know good vietnamese restaurants in the valley ?
food was not good quality .
_num_ times i ordered lemon grass beef with fried rice and got something else .
i got nothing helpful from them .
shame on it .
stop waste my time .
there 's only one nice lady there of the bunch .
Neutral
did n't taste fresh like they should have .
they might as well call it extra big bowl of noodles .
it was ridiculous .
i had to get my usual grilled pork with vermicelli noodle bowl .
_num_ minutes for sandwiches ?
cashier lady is rude !
looks like a _num_ '' tv .
staff was slow .
next time i crave chicken i 'd go to a different location .
horrible experience .
so , after the _num_ minute wait we still have to place our order .
you get _num_ refill with that . ''
a drag show ?
horrible ... ... .
staff is unfriendly and rude .
( that does n't sound like it fit her own story .
terrible experience .
their corporate office and how they will deny it .
very limited options .
no luck .
very disgusting .
i would hesitate to purchase any frozen items here .
something that would get an f if an inspection should happen by .
the prices were cheap but the product in certain areas is questionable .
went in around 2pm , had the # _num_ combo , teriyaki chicken bowl .
i would not recommend this place .
bad service !
its disgusting !
might as well not wash your hands .
my food is never all the way hot .
sucks .
viva mexico .
this is the only place where you will hate being mexican .
customers .
oh yeah let me get right on it .
i was recently in phoenix with my husband for business .
chris town ymca was the closest and i could visit _num_ times for free .
total body conditioning was listed !
terrible chemical smell .
horrible place .
last _num_ times i have n't been overly impressed with this place .
miracle mile beat its retreat long ago , of course .
there are also an assortment of booths that change every time i walk in .
but damn , am i addicted to their cafeteria food .
how gross is that ?
i 'm not a costco shopper but i know most folks are .
it was dark , dingy , and overall a bit sketchy .
advice : if you 're a tourist , find a different mall to visit .
i just stick to target , costco and the movie theater on the outside .
ick ick ick and ick .
the only reasons this mall still exists is because of walmart and target .
go here for the costco , the target , the harkins movie theater .
our family used to go there to a chinese restaurant for the orange chicken .
i remember they had a kiosk that sold gold jewelry .
i went to the kiosk where a mexican man was helping a mexican customer .
i walked off .
within the last _num_ years has struggled to attract people to the mall .
not much to this mall .
it took me a minute to locate the emergency unit .
the waiting area was very small and dark .
overall , you can count all _num_ sticks between both arms .
went on a random bar hop one night , stumbled upon this place .
i was so hungry , i tried it anyways .
i just do n't care .
not recommended !
the menu was somewhat generic .
horrible !
do not eat here .
worst pain ever !
i ordered house chicken for pickup .
slow service .
few locations and limited online ability .
why do n't you make more money ?
i will return to h & r block next year .
horrible horrible service !
they were put on in _num_ !
stock your water !
the doctor is very very very old fashioned .
reduced hours for bowling !
too bad .
this location is terrible .
very disappointing .
and my brakes are at _num_ % ?
total bill was to be $ _num_ .
a whole $ _num_ cheaper than banfield !
i will never use banfield again .
i miss her terribly .
after i had had banfield for a year , i wanted to stop it .
if you want vet care , the shelter might give you better care .
it 's ridiculous .
not helpful at all .
oh crap .
no exaggeration .
avoid this dump .
every time , they have messed up my order .
tonight , i have had it .
worst place ever .
_num_ cars were in front of me and the inside part was closed .
really poor service .
i am really let down .
i used to like kfc .
not anymore .
is n't this deceptive advertising ?
bought chicken for my family for dinner tonight .
alone .
it sent me to the camelback location where i got what i wanted .
so i went to the bar and just ordered .
maybe ill go back for karaoke if the food is good .
i am a fan of dives .
those places are why i use yelp in the first place .
fail .
my husband added cheese to his .
first of all , they forgot to put cheese on my husband 's burger .
i flagged the waitress down and told her about it .
he said he just turned it down so it should be fine now .
and she failed .
again , empty drinks .
completely unacceptable .
i 've never seen so many over-cooked burgers in my life .
but at least the mini corn dogs were good !
beer battered and gooey , with tons of ranch .
no more !
no potato salad ?
so in i walk .
tv is on , college basketball .
went for a bite .
bland .
i 've went to places nearby for even cheaper that blew me away more .
beer price is ok .
and my cell phone still smells like the restaurant .
ick .
ridiculous !
it is quite large , one of the largest i 've ever seen .
awesome store , especially to walk around in .
maybe it just exists in the two tanks that i did see .
Neutral
i will never be back .
i was willing to spend the money tonight .
now off on my _num_ mile drive back home .
this is james , a former customer of ocean floor .
it was at least _num_ - _num_ grand going into your store .
i talked to dan as the manager on duty .
he let me know that the tank was tested and everything worked fine .
return policy is not great as well .
weak sauce .
i 've been here probably _num_ times over _num_ years .
i went back a few days later and the rest suffered the same fate .
horrible customer service !
worst ever !
we got two ketchup _num_ salt _num_ peppers and three napkins .
not that good .
not a good idea !
this is my go-to when i just need quick , cheap coffee .
they are always out of most everything i am looking for .
this one 's not for me .
i purchased a setting and it went to be sized .
i wore it _num_ weeks and one of the side stones fell out .
then i had _num_ earrings one silver and _num_ gold .
their attitude is terrible .
there were two calamari salads , one with or without lettuce .
the not so good : the calamari salad .
this was not it .
my friend arrived separately and parked where the attendant told her to .
no baklava .
i ended up just taking a caesar side salad btw .
love this place but recently i 've noticed it 's not been consistent .
did they hire a new cook to take over lunch hour ?
rude !
had very bad experience .
salad from a bag for _num_ bucks ?
if i come back here , i will definitely order something else .
dinner was a gyro and fries .
this should be a _num_ hour job and they charge for _num_ + .
ridiculous .
i am never greeted by the girls at the front .
excuse me ?
i 've been coming here on and off for over _num_ years .
never going back !
( mrs. berry ) .
they pack people in wall to wall .
that happen today july 30th _num_ at 4pm .
people are wall to wall in their and their need are not being met !
poor service .
receptionists are rude and incompetent .
rude !
this pizza hut is a joke .
no thanks !
it 's been a long , long , long time .
gross .
yeah ... no .
ugh .
first time was the saturday before easter sunday .
i understand they were extremely busy because of easter .
anywho ... today was my 2nd visit .
i am normally a patient person if customer care is addressed .
this was a first for me to walk out on a business .
ciao !
the gel polish was all over our fingers & cuticles .
it was painful .
in my opinion , you get what you pay for from this establishment .
no gloves whatsoever .
today was the last time .
i doubt i go back .
this is why people shop at home depot .
dishonest , rude employees .
not a fan .
i walked out .
very poor service .
will not be eating here again .
average so a _num_ however the attitude is a _num_ .
we ordered the chicken quesadilla and was charged _num_ $ more than posted .
based on that they get a _num_ .
horrible service and horrible food .
the prices were a little steep for the food they gave .
$ _num_ dollar enchilada plates and $ _num_ dinner specials .
after some time she returned with our drinks and started to take our order .
no guacamole , nothing .
the shredded beef taco had a lot of fat on the beef .
not so anymore .
much better food , and not from a can .
horrible .
as an appetizer , we ordered the spinach queso dip .
will not be back .
gooey cheese and yummy sauce .
_num_ stars for the price and the taco .
_num_ stars for the enchilada .
very rude management !
chicken and broccoli was eh .
that 's pretty bad .
the only item that saved my mother 's was the pie .
the green beans were without doubt , from a can .
i had been wanting to try this place since it is near by me .
it was such a lie and a huge let down .
it is crap !
tonight we ordered a `` chicago style deep dish '' pepperoni pizza .
not worth it at all .
the mashed potatoes , gravy , roast turkey , chicken etc .
we even quit going for a while in hopes that it would get better .
the sauce was eh .
i saw many glowing reviews on yelp & was looking forward to this meal .
i wish i just had cereal .
too small for anything !
they are over priced and the decor needs to be redone .
he is nice and fairly personable .
this place sucks .
it reflects the ghetto area surrounding it .
customer service is pathetic .
it is mexican by a stretch of the meaning .
amazon is the better way to go .
i am very disappointed .
be careful do n't be fooled by the friendliness .
as a child my uncle use to bring me a whataburger in new mexico .
not anymore !
o ... k , less fries and a larger drink are probably fine .
but i got a jalapeno and cheese burger and the cheese is n't melted .
being from texas , i 've had my share of whataburger .
i was highly disappointed .
the food was cold .
so disappointing .
makes no sense .
i 'm a student at asu and my car was experiencing some problems .
the car is having the same problems .
the whole order cost around $ _num_ with free delivery .
so i put that aside for the egg drop soup .
almost left when i walked in .
was immediately disappointed .
dipping the shrimp into the sauce , making it a whole lot better .
the fried rice was good , typical of any fast food chinese place .
gross .
i tasted my side of home fries with onions and my single pancake .
`` it 's a little off .
i would not recommend eating here .
no repeat visit here .
i left a fat tip .
denny 's ?
no surprise there .
but pho bang takes shabby and runs with it .
nothing to write home about .
i 'd been here about three years ago ... maybe under different management .
on a saturday at _num_ pm .
soda was flat .
cheese steak was alright not the greatest .
saturday morning 9:30 .
i was looking for something quick & cheap for lunch today .
the crazy bread was awesome .
hot and ready is a lie !
so i talk to alex , another supervisor .
she is apparently busy and can not talk .
once , i can understand , stuff happens .
he wanted proof that she was under _num_ months old .
this is for the groomers .
this was my first visit at this location and last .
i 'm disappointed .
i 'm just disappointed .
horrible service all around .
they seem to get their vehicles ready only after a customer requests it .
i would not recommend this place .
the gate was installed crooked .
one side comes up about _num_ inches higher on one side .
_num_ weeks late to promised installation date .
this is not right .
the food sucks .
drinks watered down .
the bed room up stairs was awesome .
never have i felt like a fresh piece of meat like i did tonight .
this place obviously does not .
what the hell ?
not hot .
we go in , and suddenly every single guy in the club is there .
probably not going back .
this place is rundown & i felt like i was in a meat market .
this place is gross !
updated establishment .
we were very excited about this club at first .
we were very confused .
other than thinking , `` are you fucking serious ?
he sits out there on the curb holding a hose .
i have quit going there and i live less than a mile away .
the product line is the same as every subway .
terrible bar .
not a single good beer .
no taps .
very sketchy .
would not recommend .
his eye is still in the same condition and i have $ _num_ less .
they just left us hanging .
most pet owners are responsible and pic up after there pet right then .
i recently went to this location to find a shirt that i needed .
but i needed to get that shirt .
the staff was as helpful as possible .
customer service poor .
adding on unnecessary charges not approved by me .
asked for clean towels ( twice ) and they were never delivered
wrong !
avoid this place .
if i ran this place i 'd fire everyone .
go anywhere but here .
_num_ strikes you 're out !
!
too bad .
rude !
horrible customer service .
so rude !
then stated that only a manager could do something like that .
i had some tenants in my home who upon moving left some friends behind .

i had some tenants in my home who upon moving left some friends behind .
i called phoenix pest to get an estimate .
do not use this company .
do not use this company !
not sexy .
this place is trash .
except , of course , if i really wanted her to move on .
the bartender was really pretty shitty drinks though .
rude staff .
scam -- no dancers and no refund !
probably a decent place to get food , but nothing out of the ordinary .
our food was very skimpy in portion for what they charge .
nothing special .
the food is n't all that great .
the zucchini app for the table was a-ok .
for entree , i chose the ribeye with baked potato .
the potato was fine .
but , no .
the decor is cowboy steakhouse .
just simply awful .
while i was eating my salad , i started tasting onions .
i 'm not just someone who wants to complain and get a free meal .
our server brought us two cups of tortilla soup with cheese sprinkled on top .
the fries were soggy .
so disappointed .
the only apple pie on the menu was for _num_ people for $ _num_ .
my beef brisket was mostly gristle covered by a heavy sauce .
they surely need a make over .
cheap .
all i know is my experience on this wednesday evening .
it would be hard for me to recommend this to anyone .
usually not a good sign .
they were rock hard and dry .
my husband had been here before & loved the apple pie ala mode .
did n't see that coming .
the baked beans were pretty tasty .
very disappointing experience .
i thought wrong .
wrong again .
not surprised this place is closing soon .
shut the damn doors already !
it needed spices and was really tough .
after reading the reviews , we expected greatness .
those waitresses were very grumpy .
the bbq sandwich was just fair .
the chicken was cold , dry , and tough .
the ribs were over cooked and dry .
they will shoot the shit with you all night if you let them .
because if that were my intention , i 'd ignore the sign anyway .
in _num_ years i have never had an accident .
rent different guns to see what you shoot well .
i was without a shower until this was done .
first the place is not called tony 's , it 's the burger shoppe !
asked for a small coke and a carne asada burrito .
it tasted like pure grease .
do not go here for piercings !
after my experience i was scared to go back to have them fixed .
it is terrible !
i went _num_ more days .
worst experience ever .
$ _num_ loan turned into $ _num_ .
_num_ % + per month .
_num_ % per year .
seemed very nice on the phone .
i paid for two car washes within two weeks $ _num_ each ... .
stopped here for a soda after a long afternoon of shopping .
but they need better trained staff .
all of their teachers are not certified .
what a disappointment !
horrible !
low quality food !
delivered to la quinta hotel .
so unprofessional and rude .
breakfast was cold .
bathroom smelled bad .
service would change one tv and screw up _num_ others .
i would not recommend this place .
horrible service , mediocre food .
terrible food + terrible service .
food is not that great .
very expensive they charge for ice tea refill .
over priced ?
pour on it .
horrible practices .
no call .
no show .
i am unsure if i will come back to this store again .
bad attitude .
should i sleep in my car tonight ?
not even worth the call .
i may give it another try for dim sum .
disappointing .
would not go back again .
not a huge fan of dim sum .
it was busy the entire time we were there .
i went to try the walnut shrimp with mayonnaise .
some call it crystal shrimp others mayonnaise shrimp .
one of my fellow yelpers had mentioned it was her favorite here .
i will not be back .
the carts were few and far between .
so , take your chances and try their dim sums .
shrimp in lobster sauce .
pork slices .
service .
the worse service .
price was moderate , but service could use some work .
dim sum on a busy saturday .
greasy and low quality .
really disappointing .
from then on , it was always the same woman with the same items .
there are other choices for dim sum in the valley .
do n't order their soups , its loaded with msg .
the service - bad !
just unbelievable .
i would n't bother .
the place was pretty busy at 9am .
no tip given .
we order _num_ dishes but they brought out only four .
worst place ever !
staff is so rude .
horrible customer service !
i 've been to better places and treated better for less money .
i could have went to panda express and been happier .
they do n't burn noodles .
i went here for dim sum and it was pretty awesome !
they really had us for more than _num_ yrs .
a bit pricey but its the only dim sum i know near phx area .
poor quality dim sum .
never coming back again ... .
today was worst .
it was only 1pm and dim sum ends at 3pm .
what a disappointing experience .
still no sauces .
service was poor .
worst service ever !
the only person who smile were the person whom gave us our seats .
this place feels very low budget .
my last visit here can only be described as subpar .
are you kidding me ?
it was just a matter of time before i fell for one .
what the hell .
horrible !
never go to this just brakes .
then all of a sudden some work was instantly more important than other work .
i 'm not too happy about that .
i called aaa and had the car towed back to my house .
the driver even stopped at autozone for me to buy some pads .
food is n't fully cooked .
just tasted like bread and butter .
our server was luis and he was very attentive .
terrible .
probably wo n't return .
Negative
this place is terrible .
the customer service stinks !
my pancakes tasted like fish .
fries were cold .
so we tried this denny 's hoping to have a better experience .
redo was awful .
service was awful .
and around _num_ am the place was full of drunk college kids .
the smell and the visual spoiled the majority of my party 's appetite .
but a reliable late night breakfast .
the meat was gross .
he says they were pretty good .
pro : service friendliness is _num_ including concerned manager .
wish they had a rating of minus cause thats where i would put them .
went for lunch today and never got my order .
i will not go back !
another disappointing experience .
why can they make good al pastor tacos .
this past saturday i finally convince the hubs to go with me .
nothing current or that would even fly in a bath remodel these days .
do not rent here under any circumstances .
seriously ; steer way clear of this place and tell your friends .
horrible !
shut this place down seriously !
so it is take out or delivery only .
so i rescheduled for an ultrasound the following week .
so now , i come back for my ultrasound .
attended a drs appointment with my sister during the first week of march .
she comes back in and says blood pressure if great ?
it was not taken !
he quickly says he 's giving her antibiotics without running any test .
this place sucks .
worst customer service .
the manager did not return my deposit .
horrible .
i only come here because its the only one on my way to work .
customer service is not great .
i do n't like their bagels .
my favorite bagels are costco 's cheese bagels .
i 'm not going to lie .
the service is awful .
ridiculous .
not here , stay far away .
gross !
they really need to take `` urgent '' out of their name .
surely they could be playing videos on healthy eating or something like that .
this place is the total opposite of urgent care .
i was here for _num_ hours before i saw a physician .
_num_ hour in the waiting room and another in the private room .
he took no responsibility whatsoever .
slow , slow , slow !
when we got our order , they accidentally gave her chicken tacos .
this time , they accidentally added mango instead of avocado .
_num_ stars because my burrito was pretty good .
i order salad and they give me a different type of salad .
i seriously hate coming to this location .
it was rubbery and gross .
i think i deserve an actual conversation over the phone .
i really wanted to think it through .
i was pretty disappointed .
stayed home from work to wait for them .
after not hearing back from them , i sent an email requesting an estimate .
again , no reply .
we sampled cupcakes to try different flavors and frosting .
we chose _num_ flavors to try , including chocolate .
i know i could of made better cupcakes myself .
and i always find it hard to try cupcakes anywhere else .
same thing with the packaging of these cupcakes .
the whole experience was eh .
i was shocked to see the same decorations on cakes and cupcakes .
i personally will be taking a hard pass on going here again .
i 'm confused .
worse than store bought .
small cheap place , narrow aisles .
poor customer service .
avoid at all costs .
you 've been warned .
it 's all made in the same factory in chicago or wherever it is .
i am not joking .
do n't eat here .
do n't let the name of this place fool you .
wrong !
Neutral
too harsh ?
the pool is n't always clean .
the maintenance is also a joke .
worst apartment complex ever .
renovations of apartments in particular locations of the complex are receiving cosmetic cover ups .
please consider other options for your living arrangements .
the date is august _num_ , _num_ .
waited a week for the fixes so i could move in .
horrible .
i received a call the following day and explained the situation to the agent .
horrible .
they are so rude .
she is just awful .
rip-off !
i 'm going back to my old cleaners .
this cleaners is horrific !
not consistent .
after ordering , everything came out pretty quickly .
not good .
see , just not consistent !
not a chance .
oh ... .
you ca n't win with this office .
hire a security officer already !
really no stars .
pharmacy is always slow .
drive thru is not a quicker option .
very rude .
i think i could have done a better job than they did .
will not use again !
she looked terrible .
i will not be going back .
this time , i called and got an appointment _num_ weeks in advance .
now at the last minute , i need to try to find someone else .
very frustrating .
i had a hard time with my stomach .
it was later explained to me that it was the lens cutting smell .
_num_ ) why ca n't the doctor call me ?
the rice could easily be separated into individual pieces .
the beef , chicken , and shrimp were skimpy .
i only received a very small container of sweet & sour sauce .
others might like the sweeter , breaded sesame beef .
phoenix is much worse .
if you can afford ai , then you can afford another .
this place sucks .
it was so gross .
do not rent from this place !
customer service is horrible !
they did n't do shit .
the walls are so thin they still bark at each other day and night !
why do they have a gate ?
the apartment rent is $ _num_ something .
it 's a shit hole .
although the people in the office are nice nothing ever gets resolved .
they walk in the streets and twice someone has gotten hit in the streets .
two times i had to fill out a police report .
Neutral
could n't even take more than one bite .
Neutral
the server was screaming why ?
but i talked to him '' .
they may have a more professional service teams .
salads were not fresh .
limited variety .

horrible business .
not everything is better with butter !
totally not the case .
the omelet is seriously fluffy , and quite large .
that 's why i ordered an omelet .
the potatoes were not hot .
bad , bad , bad choice .
i do n't care !
not a very clean and comfortable hotel here .
i would not stay here again .

_num_ .
wallpaper in room was peeling away from the wall in many locations .

then decide if this is a place you want to eat food from .
only after ordering did i take in the grimy scene .
even rice lack flavor .
not going back .
much better greek places out there .
not going back sorry .
but the soggy fries .
soggy gyro tho .
the three of us each had a different item from the lunch specials .
oh and my favorite ... '' do you want your check now or what ?
completely rude .
went there with my husband and _num_ kids .
the beans tasted stale .
must be the gas prices cause the quality and portions have suffered .
the food was horrible !
their rice , tastes like instant rice in the microwave smothered in tomato sauce .
this place is terrible .
never will i go there again .
i see why this place is not busy .
wasted that money .
i 've been to the 7th ave location .
northern location not so great .
when it came , it was a soft taco on a flour tortilla .
but i am not sure why .
the staff was friendly , though , i 'll give them that .
far cry from the 7th ave location .
place is dirty .
fees and services are not explained even when questions are asked .
the dentist is rough in his procedures .
this is probably due to the long wait .
this place stole my money !
roach problems that spread from other units .
that was _num_ weeks ago and still nothing .
this `` first apartment '' experience started off rocky .
we get everything signed , all fees paid , ect .
yes .
just not possible .
they did email me a picture of it , however we never received it .
someone either took it off our door or it blew away .
this has not been a good experience .
over the years they have had many management companies take over .
yeah that happened to me at least _num_ times this last year .
noise levels : unbelievable .
they just keep saying `` he 's really busy '' ... .
it 's ridiculous !
the worst staff ever !
horrible company .
terrible corporation .
hole in the wall does n't always mean good food .
beef stock from a can with buckets of pepper poured into it .
new place has better food , same cheap prices .
before you know its week _num_ .
what a disappointment !
fucking disgusting !
i will never return here .
not here .
do n't bother !
met my husband for an early dinner after a work thing .
it looks like this place has n't changed since the day the built it .
table _num_ needed to be cleaned , part of the table was sticky .
the food always seems cold .
i still find sonic only mildly appealing .
crap everywhere .
no room to walk .
ugh .
dropped off a fedex package and had to ask for a shipping receipt ?
anyway , i never went back to that store .
this certainly is not tex-mex .
if you are looking for good mexican food i would recommend valle luna .
as mentioned by others , this is americanized mexican cuisine .
so much potential , but it fails on almost everything .
very disappointing .
then she apologized and walked away .
they start you off with chips and salsa .
bad service .
really really bad .
been there twice and i felt the same coming out both times .
mild sauce .
this was not one of them .
small sides of guacamole are $ _num_ .
horrible service and food .
chicken was bland no flavor .
this all cost $ _num_ .
another on bites the dust .
they used to use huge shrimp .
restaurant was very clean and airy .
the fajita pan was mostly onions .
disappointing .
chicken was dry .
valle luna has a better fajita dish with beans and rice for less money .
they never skimp on the meals .
not in a good way .
this should say steak and onions on a hot plate , not fajitas .
wo n't be back .
oh and the waste !
what a waste .
i grew up coming here .
the first thing i noticed was the decor .
it 's completely outdated .
are you kidding me ?
it 's completely unacceptable .
complimentary breakfast was standard .
i asked him about that , he said he could fix it .
no dice .
a little friendliness goes along way .
they fixed my bike wheel so that i could ride again .
outback steakhouse is alright .
ridiculous !
it took awhile to get this thru to him .
manager did offer me another salad though .
not good customer service .
i took _num_ bites and could n't eat anymore .
never will go back .
the fish tacos were dry .
stop for lunch .
service was slow .
took long for food long for drinks long for the check .
wo n't be back .
another restaurant added to the list of where not to have an enjoyable experience .
shame on the management .
several staff member walked by but none for us .
no thanks !
the service was awful !
we 're not too impressed .
my wife has n't found anything she likes .
try number _num_ was rare - blood red center .
i showed it too the waitress .
they seated my wife and i immediately and gave us brandon as our server .
i asked for ketchup and mustard and then another wait began .
anyway , not a good experience .
oh man !
i used to really like this place .
tonight i ordered a regular burger with swiss cheese ... .
no special requests .
the total was $ _num_ .
oddly , i only noticed it with the nigiri pieces .
when we first walked in i noticed the place had a smell .
i had the teriyaki chicken bowl with rice , and vegetable tempura .
sushi q is located in a strip mall next to a seedy liquor store .
i sat at the bar and designated myself as an ayce customer .
_num_ orders = _num_ pieces .
apparently not the case in stingy arizona .
the rolls were handled by a hispanic sushi chef .
the rainbow roll was standard , although the rice was a bit stiff .
that 's where the greatness ends .
would not go back .
no fish .
i am disappointed .
the salmon and tuna actually smells a little stinky .
this is minor , but imagine doing cost control with miso soup !
this time was not like that .
cold food !
short line this am , quickly seated .
ca n't include my inside voice thoughts here .
went in for breakfast this morning and was seated right away .
i found this clinic as a drive by , advertising first visit free .
she was having problems with her eyes .
a month passed , dog still had problems and could possibly be pregnant .
it 's essentially panda express and the prices are reasonable .
i did n't even finish my food .
if you want better chinese , go to panda express .
man ... never again .
restaurant is _num_ miles away .
would n't recommend it .
_num_ ) bathroom was stocked with one bar of soap .
huh ?
- tiny beds .
- heated pool ?
not so much .
called on a saturday and requested a refrigerator before sunday check in .
so it was not even cheap !
there was blood that was obviously not ours on the white comforter .
the next morning we woke up to shower and get ready for check out .
rough stay at this place .
do n't stay here .
ridiculous !
we stayed _num_ nights and only had hot water for one them .
not the best hotel .
i had booked a reservation with the sheraton back in late december .
i booked the reservation through a third party , living social .
i did mind the very low standard represented from the overall service experience .
food is awful .
but it 's not .
it could 've been way better .
this place is a pit in the sketchy part of town .
marriott needs to check in on this place .
marriott should be embarrassed .
just finished a _num_ week stay here .
not true .
i would not recommend this hotel .
however , there are one or two items i have a strange liking for .
i took my boat there from the quote i received on the phone .
third , the trailer tires all blew .
this left scratches on the sides of the boat .
wish i could give this one star .
there goes $ _num_ and here goes my future business .
food was served quickly and tasted fine .
here 's my problem .
the only food that was somewhat okay was the sweet potatoes .
on our vacation to phoenix we stopped by to eat here .
gross .
it 's sorta crammed in the end of a parking lot .
i only live _num_ miles from this hotel .
i wish i drove around first .
i 've stayed at about _num_ hotels and have never felt unsafe .
this is suppose to have a fully equipped kitchen .
just a bad hotel .
skip here .
do not stay here !
the carpet was gross !
she thanked me for the information about this place .
i stayed here for about _num_ month and i paid rent everyday on time .
as a result of that half of my belongings were stolen .
only the beans had flavor .
they seem to put raw onions in everything , including the cheese enchiladas .
i will not be back !
we will not be back .
this place is not good .
embarrassed ?
atmosphere not good for dinner .
but very overpriced .
it 's probably never crowded .
my first visit last month was awesome .
they were disgusting .
i got another basket of old , hard rocks .
we ordered steak subs , soda and split one order of fries .
i will probably never return !
burger bun smelled like fish .
just started working in the area and figured i 'd try it out .
even said , it 's just a toe .
yet i left each time not feeling he really cared .
that 's how i feel every time i walk in .
customer service is poor .
prices are highly inflated .
i grab my debit card to pay .
it is not clean !
it was so horrible .
are you kidding me ?
_num_ ) lacks imagination .
not quite at a _num_ star .
inside it looks like your neighborhood hole in the wall ; dark and dank .
i 've been wanting to check this bar out .
i do not know why they were so cold .
the only difference was is my husband is not hispanic .
not the highest quality selection for a second hand shop .
most of it was quite overpriced , probably waiting for half off day .
i prefer tokyo express for a chicken teriyaki bowl any day !
not coming here again .
not worth it .
i only signed up for this so i can blast this company .
i only signed up for this so i can blast this company .
horrible customer service .
complete rip off !
they completely scammed my _num_ year old mother .
could have gotten a new one installed for quite a bit less than that .
avoid !
stay away from smiley plumbing .
stay away from smiley plumbing .
the only one smiling is the owner all the way to the bank !
not effective .
just went in there to take my dogs out and get some food .
been coming here with all my dogs all my life .
it 's close to my house and never had a real problem .
today was very bad .
my bad .
dogs still need to eat .
fucking rude !
it 's a nightmare .
horrible beyond belief .
do not go to this place !
i pay _num_ at the dealer .
that is a _num_ % increase over the dealer .
managers response when i asked what took down long , `` shit happens ! ''
they tried to see me everything .
they tried to see me everything .
no apologies .
whole process took _num_ hours .
do n't go to this place !
slight false advertising .
they brought me a basket with one piece of chicken breast cut in half .
gate codes are never changed , so whats the point ?
they did in fact cut down almost every tree in the entire complex .
fries were over salted the last _num_ times .
i ordered the chicken sandwich as i have done many times before .
this rarely happens to me but feel the need to share .
typical , usually tasty , wendy 's old fashioned hamburgers food .
wo n't return here !
apparently corporate does n't read yelp , so i 'm calling them tomorrow !
this place is terrible .
never coming to this taco bell anymore .
she rushed our order .
it seems like we have issues every single time we come to this location .
tonight we went inside because the drive thru was backed up .
it seems that someone in the drive thru had a very large order .
it is a constant problem .
they just need to figure out a better system .
quite disappointing .
frustrating .
so not only is this place a dump but things disappear !
it is terrible !
the building is very old .
the best she could say was `` i know it seems confusing '' lol .
do not buy appliances from here !
this should n't be .
still , i have n't had a good experience at this location in awhile .
i sat around waiting , and waiting , and waiting at the flooring desk .
!
i afternoon i was in with my girlfriend and i opened a tab .
drinks are cheap and he has free buffet of meatballs and beans .
false security !
he said just _num_ .
i have been going to _num_ & arrowhead and frank r wright & scottsdale .
i have never been treated like this before !
he said just _num_ .
i have been going to _num_ & arrowhead and frank r wright & scottsdale .
i have never been treated like this before !
the atmosphere was just pretty blah all around .
no beer selection .
i am contacting my bank tomorrow to get this corrected .
ok cool .
now here is the deal , tonight i decided to pickup our order .
i drove by here a few times so i tried it out .
the kids dug in , but i had a turkey sandwich .
not my favorite .
probably will not get again.
could n't even finish them .
ordered _num_ ate _num_ .
very sad .
we got two burgers , one sub and one grilled chicken sandwich .
the bun was bigger than the chicken breast .
ever !
_num_ chicken avocado salads , that 's it !
he says hold on and somebody else gets on the phone .
he says oh i know .
do n't bother !
are you kidding ?
the portion size is hit or miss .
all of the way across and _num_ layers on the bottom .
i kept hoping somewhere in there i was going to find some meat .
well there was very , very little .
but , it will be a long time before that happens again.
terrible place !
horrible food !
when we walked in , about a 1/2 dozen tables were occupied .
the rice was bland .
they are thin , crispy and pretty darn delicious .
i 'm not the biggest fan of nacho cheese on taco shop nachos .
the chips were really a killer though .
the chicken they use is a little funky too .
here are my problems .
my quesadilla had sour cream and guacamole on the inside when it was toasted .
they are thin , crispy and pretty darn delicious .
i 'm not the biggest fan of nacho cheese on taco shop nachos .
the chips were really a killer though .
the chicken they use is a little funky too .
smothered in enchilada sauce .
wrong !
very ugly modern church .
the blankets were really thin .
the wifi was spotty .
really bad and strong .
i was then given another room , which was indeed a smoke free room .
unbelievable !
oh and we can not forget the screaming children and baby !
( no exaggeration ) .
we were running late and ran down to breakfast as we were checking out .
did i mention the room was still packed with people eating ?
not only that but apparently they have a little bee problem .
Neutral
this place is disgusting !
buyer beware !
i 'm not mad about it , it 's just the truth .

it is so disappointing .
horrible old chicken .
the product is awful .
Negative
so i go into the office and find out what is going on .
they only came and addressed one or two things after i filed the papers .

egg rolls are bland .
place smelled musty when we first came in .
how disgusting !

restrooms are horribly dirty .
such poor customer service .
on _num_ different occasions , i have found cockroaches in the pool .
i am only staying here because my son 's school is in walking distance .
apparently _num_ during the day and _num_ during the night is too cool .
ok i went here last night , the staff was very nice .
i understand business inside and out .
which amounts to about $ _num_ an hour if you do the math .
anyway , long story short .
nothing significant sold .

what an amazing disappointment !
we should 've just left right away .
they were extremely slow .
i doubt i would be back .
stupid me .
i should have walked out .

i know it 's good but a little expensive .
for the money tho , it was average .

that 's it .
Negative
the neighborhood it 's in is very shady to begin with .
i got bits all over my body .
third room okay i guess .
just wanted to sleep .
the location is sketchy !
the pride of that door quickly melts away as i order the food .
she should not be a manager .
the jewelry i bought turned out to be defective .
obviously too big for my ears .
i said , yeah , can i get like a coupon or something ?
the worst .

sucks to suck .
bummer of a hotel .
would not stay here again .
Positive
Negative
get ready for to sweat your ass off .
_num_ stars out of _num_ .
this place has not gotten any better over the past _num_ years .
been here a couple times and its been hit or miss .
so i let the girl on register know .
went to go get a berry chicken salad .
i asked for my money back .
do not recommend .
i wanted more vegetables with the chicken teriyaki .
explains why so empty .
not needing anything fancy i requested the $ _num_ service and oil change .
i would need to upgrade to the $ _num_ service .
obviously i freaked out and called him out on the bait and switch .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
makes no sense .
they lie , and do who knows what other questionable practices .
actually , one of my break lights has been out for a while .
this place is slow .
_num_ hrs later it still has n't got done .
wal-mart would have been better .
absolutely no power whatsoever .
so disappointing .
bone dry .
they lost my business !
worst service ever .
10pm on a friday night .
tried subway substitute steak sandwich .
horrible .
a new hire assistant did them .
prior with instructions not to file them .
wrong !
there is a del taco across the street ; what was i thinking ?
but this month they blew in _num_ times .
on the upside , it might be good for large groups .
stopped in last friday for dinner .
we were n't expecting to much walking in but the atmosphere was pretty nice .
they had a huge wait staff waiting for diners to come in .
the app was served and i was like , what ?
i was very disappointed .
i mean , come on !
our last order was a chicken taco salad .
very disappointed .
very mediocre .
however , not in the last year .
really disappointed .
that 's not okay .
service , horrible .
i did n't even finish it .
it 's a hot metal plate with some meat and cheese he likes .
never , ever coming back .
so disappointed .
our waitress was terrible .
what we received was a dry lump of fish sitting in a tortilla .
i now know why it 's never packed anymore !
this will not be it .
it has not started well .
my chimichanga for a fried item is completely soft .
low quality food .
seems old pre made .
but bad is bad .
one last thing i feel i must add on to this .
if you are hispanic you will get treated much better .
service was the worst !
really bad .
very disappointing .
still no food .
this restaurant clearly does n't need yours or my patronage .
i 've been to this location on _num_ different occasions .
i 've not been impressed with the food or service .
wrong !
i 'm really starting to wonder about you , phoenix .
considering this fact alone , i feel that lenny 's is a bit overpriced .
this place is a small ( seats _num_ along the window ) snack stand .
similar to the snack bars at sporting events .
in _num_ seconds we agreed to make this a take out order .
my wife had a chicken salad that i could have made at home .
i 'll try my luck at another location , perhaps .
very disappointed overall !
the staff is rude .
sign on the door says they are open at 10:30 .
lemon chicken sauce was gummy , so was the sweet & sour pork .
just run of the mill chinese .
totally bland food .
first time here ; tonight for dinner .
i have been going to this restaurant for years .
food is ok however again last time for this reason alone .
its not a _num_ 's gang thing .
it may not be safe !
this is the wal-mart of pool halls .
it 's massive and impersonal .
the beer is nothing special .
never a shortage of tables .
service is pretty slow .
nothing special .
plain and simple .
the only flavor it had was the occasional pocket of black pepper .
`` flies spread disease .
horrible !
bunch of idiots .
never going back .
chicken sucks anyway .
i will not eat here again .
i went in at 1pm and got lunch .
bread ... _num_ % better .
it was probably mayo but with too much sweet pickle mixed in .
plus i was cheap enough that my mom could afford it .
plain white bread .
glad i drove out of my way for it .
very disappointed .
i used to come here when i was growing up .
wrong .
wo n't be back .
meat portions were small at best !
not my favorite sub sandwich .
the place is okay , the staff is alright .
the closet next pizza hut place was close after being referred by this location .
i can not afford to go to another dentist !
horrible wait time .
( and donuts too ! )
crap food .
anyhow , i got rolled tacos with guacamole and a cheese quesadilla .
the quesadilla was as expected .
i get home and they forget two burritos .
obviously not , she wrote it on her arm .
found out this was the closest to us so we drove over .
ugh .
ok , this place is cheap .
hostess takes card to the buffet and fills your take-out box .
)
, beef with broccoli , some shrimp thing and bbq pork ribs .
the only one that actually had flavor was the ribs .
no flavor .
me , i 'm not feeling this place at all .
wish u could rate this place less .
everything is fried and tastes like it was all cooked in the same oil .
i can not imagine how the health department has not closed it down .
i was skeptical and nervous to go in .
seems like they are constantly cooking ( people probably come for take out ) .
the place needs a serious cleaning !
clean the place and seriously this will be a _num_ star yelp restaurant .
but if u really want to try it get it to go .
the owners need to hire new chefs and check the quality of their food .
horrible customer service .
the salsa was not good .
her response was oh ok .
horrible experience !
that was rude !
she didnt even deserve a penny .
it was bad .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
_num_ stars _num_ person walk out .
whoever owns this mcdonald 's needs to really get their staff in check !
terrible !
however , i was dressed in business casual attire and was friendly to them .
she did n't know english .
no apologies offered .
only cold food .
pissed .
the pancakes were cold .
that is why i stopped going a long time ago .
there are enough options there to satisfy most .
the cheesy texas toast bread .
not so here .
famous chicken and their salad bar , prices for quality far over priced .
very disappointed !
it 's almost a guarantee that they 'll forget to put something in there .
it 's annoying .
just terrible food .
so sad .
and wear gloves .
booths were dirty and uncomfortable .
she did not greeted us .
i only needed fills and polish .
wrong !
avoid these guys .
it was just weird .
ca n't beat the takeout .
not by a long shot .
( i was the only customer at the counter ) .
rude , rude , rudeness !
it is obvious that the doctors and physicians have too much on their plates .
i went in april for my annual exam .
very poor service .
but the second time was surprisingly even longer of a wait .
ok , fast forward to my appointment date .
they say , buy here pay here .
their selection of vehicles is not over _num_ like they claim .
the first thing she asked , who much money do you have .
there phone is always busy and i can never talk to someone .
this was my second time coming to this restaurant .
not a whole lot to be said for this home depot .
@ _num_ n. _num_ rd .
i will remember this the next time i decide where to shop .
you always have to hunt them down or have some one hunt them down .
last week i went at 8:30 pm to get some wood cut .
thanks but no thanks .
this guy sucks .
the gentleman helping me was awesome !
havent been to this mall in awhile .
no class .
no common sense .
only go to arrowhead for what this mall does n't carry .
this mall is not too big .
they literally grab you sit you down and push you to buy their product .
the food is disgusting !
so overall this is exactly what i experienced going to desert sky mall .
can we just get the phone fixed ?
what a mess !
veterinarian suggested for a surgery worth $ _num_ .
our visit with a shot cost us $ _num_ .
needless to say it was very expensive .
just spare the disaster .
such horrible customer service .
hr needs to come down and get this store into shape .
it 's very difficult to find a good asian market here .
worst place ever !
terrible customer service .
_num_ 's a crowd ?
we wait _num_ and still nothing .
i hear it takes a long time to get your food even for dine-in .
service is horrible !
they dont refill your drinks , which i always just order water .
this place sucks .
does n't stop by to see if you need anything .
food is terrible .
service horrible .

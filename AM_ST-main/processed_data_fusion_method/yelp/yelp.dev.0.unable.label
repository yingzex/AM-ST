waitresses are slow .
bad !
this place is awful !
not the food but the service .
worst service ever .
i 'll never b going back .
place is in desperate need of some renovation .
drink was served in a cheap plastic cup .
also way too much cheese .
gross .
it never fails .
bad customer service .
they are not compassionate or understanding to my condition .
that is ridiculous !
very disappointed .
first off , this place is beyond crowded !
also , most of the machines are taken all the time .
horrible gym and service !
the equipment is outdated .
it always feels crowded .
make him put his weights away !
i have n't been in awhile because of these reasons .
disgusting .
horrible .
i travel _num_ miles further to the peoria location which is much nicer .
i the steam rooms door has been cracked for over three months now .
the worst !
avoid this location .
equipment was disgusting .
that 's pretty ridiculous .
never again will i go there .

why do they charge so much to use credit cards ?
phoenix az ... .
they had apparently called the clubhouse to complain about our pace .
bunkers are annoying and inconsistent .
no pay at pump .
the entire visit lasted two and a half hours .
she just is n't thorough .
she just was n't good with people .
there are way better places than here so please look else where .
two thumbs down .
decoration is outdated .
overall , it 's a typical chinese american restaurant .
poor service .
extremely long wait time .
_num_ hour wait just for them to bullshit us !
avoid this place .
called early this morning at 8am to schedule an appointment for an oil change .
very sad .
gross .
nothing at all .
just a terrible location .
it was n't any better .
the guy in front of us was ordering in spanish .
asked for fried rice and honey sesame chicken .
ugh .
my boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything .
she rings me up and hands me one cup .
sat down to eat .
the honey sesame chicken was cold .
this last trip may have been the breaking point .
poor service .
when you pay for your order her proceeds to walk away after your change .
tip to all the panda express managers .
its not hard to take an order .
customer service _num_ : never argue with a customer !
how rude !
i have already called like _num_ times .
i keep trying to give this place a chance .
the upside down blizzard was water down .
disappointed !
some basic math and people skills would make the customer experience a lot better !
my husband and i went to dq and we went through the drive through .
it was horrible .
bad service .
i do n't recommend going there .
this place is awful .
terrible .
disgusting !
asked for sausage egg cheese biscuit with bacon instead of sausage .
my husband has had problems with this location too .
wo n't be back .
the least they could do was substitute tenders in place of breast .
do not go here for food .
any chain restaurant , for that matter , has better pizza .
i ordered a large pepperoni for $ _num_ .
my wife and i thought the sauce tasted more like ketchup than pizza sauce .
no apology or nothing !
horrible service .
arrived early to my appointment scheduled at 3pm .
it too was similar .
how else can one explain the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?
the hot n sour soup was okay .
my partner thought it too sour .
the `` sour '' is n't in the name to make it sound pretty .
it looks like someone 's already eaten it ! ''
it had very little sauce and very little cheese .
the crust was plain and there was a lot of it .
this was awful pizza .
the crust on a frozen pizza was better than the crust on this one .
anyhow , i think there are probably better places to eat in the area .
the bathrooms were very clean and the booth we were in was comfortable .
i spoke with a manager , erica martin about our happy hour drinks .
she would drag on the words in a high pitch voice .
it was bad .
they were quite disgusting .
extremely dense and hard to eat .
i noticed a reply on my rating .
the food was disgusting .
wo n't be back .
( this was done a week previous to this . )
ultimately , it felt like being in a factory .
not really fried rice , just seasoned rice .
i am not a fan .
the orange chicken was not good .
i have to say , i find the meat to be super sketchy .
service - sketchy ... um appetizers are served before the entree not after .
not much of the egg was noticeable in either dish .
meaning mexican style fajita cooking .
or did you just quit caring ?
shame on you !
they are cheap .
hate the service .
this place was freezing cold inside !
the sweet and sour pork , taste like chicken nuggets !
wait lets not talk about it !
so i been looking for a year .
Negative
i guess if you do n't mind doing that it 's worth $ _num_ .
the star is for me and my seasoning additions !
their salsas are not spicy or flavorful .
there are only like _num_ chairs inside .
customer service is n't good .
my standards are n't met .
this doctor was horrible .
are you freaking kidding me ?
i ca n't do that .
but i can try to texture it . ''
she became defensive .
i totally regret ordering from them .
the pizza came more quickly than we had anticipated !
very very disappointing .
but didnt think it meant getting a _num_ % cooked pizza .
?
i was sadly disappointed .
probably the least appetizing chinese food i 've had in my life .
this is a oil change express station with two servicing stations .
can never get things fixed .
george is probably the only trustworthy employee in this whole entire complex .
i called to help one of my employees get an apartment today .
can never get things fixed .
george is probably the only trustworthy employee in this whole entire complex .
do not move here !
that 's not my problem !
we opened the door to the room , it smelled .
i asked for _num_ queen beds and got _num_ double beds .
so , this place was perfect to just sleep and go .
the room is simple with a small electric stove , sink , and microwave .
for some reason , my room had some strawberry jelly all over the place .
yelp is my review , my story , and my life .
we left at 6am cutting our _num_ night start to one .
it was rated two star on hotwire but that was a real stretch !
they deserve a star .
bad sign # _num_ .
the door would not open .
bad sign # _num_ .
i 'm glad i got this for such a cheap price through hotwire .
it was n't worth it .
total rip-off !
the only answer i got was prices are different after certain hours .
not the best mexican resturant we 've been to , but it 's cheap !
went through drive thru , ordered two _num_ piece chicken strips .
drove away , got on freeway headed out of town .
i had to get off freeway and return them .
as soon as she saw me she knew why i was there .
she did agree to adding a order of fries free of charge .
not cool .
poor poor customer service .
so rude !
is this a race or she just hates taking orders ?
no patience at all !
worst ever .
terrible .
i showed approved and then showed printing receipt .
_num_ for the homeless .
so he offered to replace the _num_ piece white with _num_ dark meat choices .
skip skip skip it .
while the food itself seems to taste okay .
it has not been the same on several occasions .
he gave me my money back .
it was disgusting .
so done trying new nail places .
oops , i was using caps !
terrible experience .
big mistake .
this does not make any sense .

the waitress then offered to refill our bread basket .
of my entree , only the salad was great !
my son 's smothered steak was da bomb !

it is tolerable maybe once but not four times .
i had never been to a texas roadhouse quite like this one .
as im using the restroom one of the workers com in to clean .
im pissed !
i walk away and go to the host and ask for a manager .
the manager said well i talk to her .
it was pretty awful .
horrible system with seating .
it was a thick burger smothered with salty onions , mushrooms & cheese .
it was disgusting !
i was disappointed .
i had to stay outside in the hot sun of _num_ .
other pizza places always put dips and napkins when you buy pizza from them .
the wings was n't that good .
me and my husband went here last saturday for an early dinner .
thanks _num_ star for that .
there are tvs on , not loud .

none of that .
_num_ star there .
for a steakhouse , some darker brews compliment the meat .
try a guinness or a porter , really .
very dangerous area it is infested with scorpions .
sure would like to know why ?
the buildings are semi quiet , ca n't complain about that .
old appliances , like really old !
really old washers and dryers that seem to run super loudly .

brooklyn boys ' alfredo blows this place out of the water !

the food in my opinion is so commercial .
i guess everyone is so used to their mcdonalds and microwave dinners .
i ordered the cheese ravioli with tomato sauce .
i think that 's totally awesome .
it was inedible .
so disappointing .
horrible service .
olive garden is olive garden .
people have bad days .
businesses have bad days .

not a big fan .

granted it was busy .
i tell him `` sir , i 'm standing right here in line . ''

when she dropped off our food she gave us the check as well .
horrible customer service today !
it was very busy .
our waitress , andrea , was nice , though quite rushed .
waffles were looking good .
they were naturally cold so we asked for something a little fresher .
p e r i o d .
first , the driver was super late to pick up our stuff .
tried complaining to corporate office and they turned me back to the manager .
now this place sucks .
idiots !

not by a long shot !
i could deal with the really basic room .
gross !
there were a handful of flies waiting to greet us in our room .

having to wait a long time for just my drink .

just terrible !
there were many customer dogs in the store , and nobody was petting them !
horrible service .
went to get my dogs nails trimmed and bath .
i only go since it is on the way home from work .
the selection is just so-so .
i was there yesterday , and the line was nine customers deep .
any other store , one could request a price check .
i got sucked in .
well that 's a load of horse $ h !
the cheese bread was yummy as well !
gross gross gross !
Positive
frankly , i know better than to order wings from a national chain store .
but domino 's is at least on par with pizza hut and papa johns .
is n't this dinner time ?
do not go here .
she just told me to pick something else .
it 's not wise to assume everyone knows the way your business is run .
rude !
rude .
rude .
rude .
as of harkins goes this theater is a hit or miss .
the seating sucks .
the movie detail sucks .
the popcorn sucks .

luckily i had cash so i paid her for exactly what i had ordered .
there was an employee drinking beer while he was working .
horrible !
serves bad and slow .
no silverware .
the decor was a lot nicer than i was expecting too .
poor ambience and operations .
she is also an canadian / bosnian .
it a hole in the wall in the middle of crack haven .
the cheese pita might be the same _num_ , close to it .
really not impressed at all .
the sandwich was dressed with a not so tasty dressing .
but on the bright side they do have hot peppers as an option .
it was corned beef on a roll .
they toasted my bread and popped the corned beef in the microwave .
i tried a side of cole slaw and it seemed very processed .
my husband purchased some of their house made hot sausage .
any two different items _num_ .
this was our cue to leave .
needless to say we were shocked .
not worth it to me .
stop by for a beer sat .
they are charging _num_ a bottle .
some of my favorite bars have been considered dive bars .
she welcomed us and said hello as soon as we walked in .
stopped by for a local , fire grilled burger .
what a disappointment .
it sure was quick , but , come on !
this was not good .
i have went to this location over a hundred times in high school .
i literally could n't believe what had happened .
that is n't cool .
not satisfied at all .

i 've gone with my mother to buy appliances here .
there are no mirrors !
just gross .
pretty sad , really .

i really hate coming here .
i ca n't wait to get rid of sprint because of this !
i said i only use apple .
the store manager told the sales guy to give me an apple .
that was _num_ weeks ago .
a little more professionalism and significantly more customer appreciation is needed at this company .
very limited selection of everything .
the selection was similar to sweet tomatoes , but lower quality .
big huge mistake .
both looked grossed as hell .
the stations were messy and they were short staffed .
it was _num_ degrees today .
we 'll not go back .
i was very disappointed .
not a great selection , but cheaper than sweet tomato .
still , gross !
just went back this weekend .
not as good as 1st few times .
the place was crowded on monday morning ( labor day ) .
when you 're passing through town , get thee to the grocery .
i 've had better from other greasy spoon diners and brunch places in california .
well , no kidding !
the sides were terrible .
the mac n cheese was almost gone .
no mashed potatoes .
not smart and maybe not final .
so i was immediately done with this place .
parking is horrible !
trying to get in and out is a constant challenge .
i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .
whose **** do i need to suck to get a drink around here ?

disappointing .

too bad .
the cheese is different , the crust is different .
why why why ?
the wings are sorry .
he was a total ass .
and the cashier was a complete bitch .
her attitude was disgusting .
making my wings get cold as i waited for the pizza to get done .
the salad was heavy on the onions , easy on the anything else .
( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .
i strongly suggest something ( anything ) else .
may i recommend the apricot chicken or mixed grill ?
horrible service !
i would normally give og a 3-4 .
so i asked again for the manager and explained the situation .
she was not even friendly !
also , someone said the regulars are a joy to hang out with ?
the selection was better but probably because it 's a ghost town at metro .
do n't go to this metro location .
this place was filthy !
)
never again in this dump .
so disappointing .
fried shrimp was over cooked .
when i first walked in , i was hit with that bathroom smell .
yes , hoping someone would hear me .

so sad .
no apologies , nothing .
big mistake .
i guess that is not the case .
i took my _num_ yr old dog into her first teeth cleaning last week .

i called the salon before purchasing the groupon to check their availability .
the customer service that i experienced here was on par with any other salon .
however , this is a school .
as such , the quality and consistency of the services are not reliable .
it is simply awful .
my pedicure , however , turned out okay with minimal polish on the skin .
when entering , i was willing to give the techs a chance .
i washed my hands _num_ times that night .

cops always seem to be here .
not a family friendly place at all .
the carpet had at least _num_ stains .
trash every where .
my boyfriend and i recently drove cross country .
we picked _num_ cities to stop in while driving .
the area seemed very sketchy .
i am glad we only stayed one night here .
this hotel sucks .
if i could give it a _num_ i would .
outside smells _num_ times better than my room did .
maintenance replaced the phone .
call the front desk and request one , this is approx .
just uncomfortable .
the sheets , comforter , and towels were stained .
ridiculous .
online pick up you better be ready for long delays .
never was waited on while the service desk person took customers out of order .
this place is terrible !
nobody called me .
how absurd !
got a groupon deal that said i would get a synthetic blend oil change .
manager said i could pay more to get a synthetic o change .
made an appointment to get my oil changed at 8am on june 2nd .
but nothing show stopping .
it has n't been for quite a few years .
